She also pushed for the school\u2019s administration and student leaders to demand that Greek organizations adopt race-blind charters. In 1968, a measure passed on the GW campus that barred Hellenic organizations from discriminating on the basis of race.\n\nAs the Post writes, that was the same year Cooper Cafritz co-created \u201ca pilot workshop in creative arts.\u201d That workshop would eventually become the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, one of the country\u2019s top arts-intensive high schools.\n\nEstablished in 1974, the school was modeled after New York City\u2019s High School of Performing Arts; notable Ellington alumni include comedian Dave Chappelle, writer and CNN contributor Michaela angela Davis, musician Meshell Ndegeocello and opera singer Denyce Graves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was a mover and shaker in both the worlds of art and politics in Washington, but Cooper Cafritz\u2019s legacy is complicated by her polarizing tenure as D.C. school board president, the Post notes.\n\n\u201cShe had many detractors,\u201d political commentator Mark Plotkin said about Cooper Cafritz, \u201cbut what cannot be taken away from her is the singular achievement of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts.

I know she has a new single coming, but I\u2019d rather smell the insides of one of Sloppy Steve\u2019s seven undershirts than give that Australian white woman who oddly rapped like Charli Baltimore another chance. \u201cPu$$y\u201d will forever slap, but that\u2019s the best I can do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here are some Negroes and others I\u2019m either giving another chance or encouraging you to give a break.\n\nAzealia Banks\n\nI know, I know. She\u2019s worn me out for years, too. However, if she\u2019s going around doling out apologies to Beyonc\u00e9 and Nicki Minaj, I think maybe, just maybe, I can open up my heart and let her bops back in. But here are a few tips: Put away the bleaching cream. Stop beefing with Remy Ma, even though you weren\u2019t wrong. Actually, stop jumping into other people\u2019s problems altogether. Just continue apologizing to everyone and make your music. That\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugar-Free Xscape\n\nSo when I found out that three members of Xscape\u2014Tiny, Tocha and Tamika\u2014were planning to record new music as Xscape without Kandi, I was excited. As we noticed on their reality show, their appearance on Watch What Happens Live and every other appearance on live television, Kandi is cool with getting this reunion-tour check, but not much else thereafter. Their first single, \u201cDream Killa,\u201d is a bop.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of those singles\u2014which I will not name, out of respect for the trio\u2014are not it. One sounds like an OMG Girlz (RIP) reject, and the other sounds, uh, awful. Ladies, I am rooting for y\u2019all and want to spend coins on this reported EP, but please don\u2019t put out anything that will prove Kandi right. That\u2019s what I felt near the end of 2017, and it made me uneasy because Kandi acted all the way up on the Bravo show. I believe in y\u2019all, so I\u2019m going to light a candle at church (OK, in my mind) that y\u2019all will steer this back right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPro tip: Record songs like \u201cIn the Rain,\u201d that cover of DeBarge\u2019s \u201cAll This Love\u201d from the forgotten New York Undercover soundtrack, and anything else that will give me lots of harmony and book vocals. Don\u2019t do shit else. Don\u2019t rap. Don\u2019t try to make Fashion Nova auntie tunes. Just sing down.\n\n\n\nTinashe\n\nStop laughing. I have felt bad for Tinashe. She\u2019s a talented singer-songwriter, dancer and producer. She had her own sound crafted in her childhood home that led to mixtapes, a small but vocal following, a major label deal, a very solid debut album and then ... well, I don\u2019t know what RCA, her record label, is doing over there. She\u2019s been teasing a return to music, and while I know many of you only know her as the \u201c2 On\u201d girl, please give her another chance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeri Hilson\n\nI know she became the Maleficent of R&B, but I miss her thot bops. Usually, I never forgive those who cross Beyonc\u00e9, but hasn\u2019t the woman suffered enough? Keri, I don\u2019t know where you are and what you\u2019re doing, but can you come back and drop some new tunes already? At the very least, can you email me that song \u201cDinero\u201d that you teased on your Snapchat and Instagram years ago? I really need it. Pretty (girl rock) please or some shit, if saying that helps?\n\n\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\n\nThus far, this season has been a bore. Too many of them don\u2019t have jobs, interesting storylines or quality wigs. I\u2019m \u2019bout fed up, but because, along with many of you, I have history with the show, I\u2019m trying to hold on. I\u2019m going to give this a few more episodes on good faith, but if this continues to be NyQuil with advertisers, I say do a major overhaul. That\u2019s better than me saying call Phaedra Parks.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMariah Carey\n\nMimi already got a second chance with the New Year\u2019s Eve performances, but I personally have not forgiven the public for sleeping on her last album. She\u2019s in the studio, so do her a favor and atone once it drops. Thanks.\n\n\n\nThe Formation World Tour\n\nThis is not so much asking for a second chance as it is me wondering where the hell the tour special is and begging Beyonc\u00e9 to go ahead and drop it. I\u2019ll take back what I said about Keri Hilson if it means it\u2019ll come sooner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiara\n\nThe former multiplatinum-selling artist who had multiple hits\u2014including numerous No. 1s on the Hot 100\u2014somehow morphed into a Kardashian with a strange accent. Nonetheless, Ciara continues to look amazing and appear limber, and now that she\u2019s found a new record deal, I\u2019m hoping that she remembers exactly the kind of music that made her a star to begin with. She should call Jazze Pha and ask him to dig through the crates.\n\n\n\nRemy Ma\n\nI know, I know. She released \u201cSHEther.\u201d She also released \u201cAnother One,\u201d which was terrible, and \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d which is not that lit. I may love Nicki Minaj, but I do really like Remy. She can do better than \u201cWake Me Up.\u201d I just don\u2019t understand how you jump on the beat of \u201cQueen Bitch\u201d and can\u2019t rap on the beat. And why is the legendary Kimberly Jones doing a Young Thug impersonation on the sample of her iconic track?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Real\n\nIt\u2019s Tamar-less, but it\u2019s going to be on until 2020 anyway. But Loni, practice more with that teleprompter, love.\n\nAlicia Keys\n\nI see that Alicia Keys will be on Justin Timberlake\u2019s new album. Now, I haven\u2019t liked an Alicia Keys album in a smooth decade. She\u2019s had a few nice tracks here and there (I mean \u201cIn Common,\u201d basically), but let the record show that if she decides to record a new album that recalls \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know My Name,\u201d my heart and streaming service of choice are both open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nM\u00fda\n\nM\u00fda never went away, but because she\u2019s an independent artist, many miss out on the music she\u2019s been making. Music that\u2019s been much like Moodring, her finest project and one of the best R&B albums of the 2010s. Listen to the EPs With Love and Love Elevation Suite, plus the album Smoove Jones.\n\nAmeriie\n\nIf she loses the extra I. I miss her music (first two albums). I miss R&B singers who make chill music in their real accents. No shade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMario\n\nThis man made the Go album, and look what we did to him. Ingrates!\n\nBrandy\n\nIf she finally accepts that Whitney Houston had more than one friend.\n\nAshanti\n\nI\u2019ll admit to not appreciating Ashanti as much as I arguably should have in years past\u2014well, the \u201cRock Wit U (Aww Baby)\u201d years, as opposed to the ass-scooting-on Queen Latifah\u2019s-stage moments. In any event, she\u2019s releasing new music, and before you dare try it, the material is good. I actually bought her new single, \u201cSay Yes,\u201d featurithng Ty Dolla $ign, and based on that Instagram of hers (that looks like wealth and happiness), she seems to have a budget for quality producers and features. I want her to have another lil\u2019 moment again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmarion\n\nOmarion reminds me of a 1990s sitcom dad. That\u2019s not a compliment. On the other hand, he\u2019s making really great music. And I don\u2019t mean the song about ass eating\u2014which straight folks won\u2019t stop arguing about because they\u2019re two centuries late to it. Moving on ... yes, Omarion is a bit corny, and it\u2019s hard to forgive anyone who wouldn\u2019t want to give Lil Fizz whatever he wants, but listen to the CP4 EP and tell me it\u2019s bad. If you tell me that, your ass is lying.\n\n\n\nTrump Voters\n\nI\u2019m kidding. Fuck those people forever. Instead of those, let\u2019s just say Instagram. Its algorithm keeps pissing me off, but since I know I\u2019m not about to let the app go anytime soon, I have to at least try to make peace.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "banks", "music", "chance", "2nd", "dont", "record", "17", "thats", "miss", "2018", "azealia", "shes", "im", "deserve", "album"], "polarity": 0.11671426003172687, "subjectivity": 0.43153158835278044},

Some also say it was the news breaking shortly before the election that there had been a BET party at the White House where Bell Biv DeVoe reunited to perform \u201cPoison.\u201d Admittedly, I am the only person I\u2019ve heard express this theory, but as sure as the FBI shot down Otis Redding\u2019s plane to break the spirit of black people in 1967, history will bear me out.\n\n\n\nOne year and some change after the Election, as the nation is on the brink of being engulfed by fascism and obliterated by nuclear war, we might consider other factors that led us here. In The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s magnum opus of Dominican history, a character opines that the cruelty that Dominicans show one another is the aftermath of having been under the rule of a murderous, racist dictator for 31 years. \u201cTen million Trujillos is all we are,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the matter of Donald Trump, I am suggesting the reverse. Maybe each of us brought this fate on ourselves by being too much like Trump. Not specifically the pathological-liar, rich, white developer person from Queens, N.Y., whose father attended a Ku Klux Klan rally, but Donald Trump, a transhistorical spirit of Absolute Wrongness. And we need to extract whatever\u2019s inside us that could possibly resemble that.\n\n1. Don\u2019t surround yourself exclusively with the same type of person.\n\nAlmost any picture of Donald Trump in President Barack Obama\u2019s old office looks the same: a crowd of shockingly unattractive elderly white men, from King White Walker Pence to Paul Mush-My-Face Ryan, celebrating a lunch of the bones of your child. Sometimes there\u2019s a wraithlike white woman in there. This is not just judging a book by its cover; read about Rex Tillerson and Steven Mnuchin, for example. These guys (and one or two ladies) are really the same: grotesquely wealthy, vitamin D-deficient, cruel, thoughtless and incompetent except in the game of fleecing other humans and raping the earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s you. Perhaps you feel your friends and acquaintances are a rich, diverse stew of politically progressive strivers, primarily black and middle-class, a couple of nice whites, but also those two Asian-American friends, one Korean, the other Chinese. But how does your group look to those two friends, the two nonblack ones whose names your other friends keep confusing?\n\nThe un-Trump move here is to expand your horizons. Get to know a straight-up Marxist who can tell you what the U.S. did to Chile in the 1980s. Familiarize yourself with the worldview of black lesbian anarchists. Get to know your local purveyor of halal treats or one of the exceedingly dapper elderly Ethiopian gentlemen who convene outside your local coffee shop. Imagine yourself in the Oval Office surrounded by something like America\u2014not majority white, but a full range of different skin colors and hairstyles and different religious head coverings. And the next time one of your black friends confuses Jen with Kimberly, tell them that shit is racist.\n\n2. Familiarize yourself with the Constitution.\n\nSince it seems doubtful that your president has not read this particular law of the land, you seriously need to brush up. For example, did you know that our Constitution gives the executive branch the right to \u201cput sulky and unpatriotic blackes [sic] in the stocks on a public square of his choice\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut since Donald Trump seems largely unaware of his job description and is employing a just-do\u2013it-and-let-the-American Civil Liberties Union-come-after-me approach, it would behoove you to know the articles and certainly the amendments\u2014the First, 13th and 14th being of particular interest. And, oh yes, the 25th.\n\n3. Re-evaluate your relationship with reality television.\n\nIt is indisputable that reality television, the utterly mediocre The Apprentice, elevated Trump to the highest post in the most powerful country in the world. This must be addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan you at least level-down your watching? Yes, I know, Cardi B, but thanks to reality television, the United States is flirting with the idea of nuclear war. Or, I don\u2019t know, maybe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d can be the soundtrack to the postnuclear ashes of our society.\n\nAnd you might think about that while re-evaluating your relationship to Twitter, as well, since those digital screens are DT\u2019s direct line to your soul. The words of a revolutionary (if sexist) bard come to mind: \u201cYo, why don\u2019t you just back up from the Twitter, read a book or something? Read about yourself, learn your culture; you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\n4. Stop eating burned steak.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that Donald Trump has in common with a noncrazy black person is that he does not enjoy a bloody steak. Intriguingly, eating charred-crisp steak is a key cultural practice among roughly the same group of Americans once likeliest to eat boiled pig intestines. Who can say why?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would hazard that as marginalized people, we did not want to be reminded of the proximity of meat (edible) to cow (animated, brown-eyed). Also, while chitlins have fallen from favor in my generation (leaving los boricuas y los mexicanos to take up the charge with tripe), it bears mentioning that chitlins are, in fact, very well cooked.\n\nAt any rate, the black community can be seen anywhere from fancy French bistros to Outback insisting on filet mignon the consistency and color of hockey pucks. But if that\u2019s Trump\u2019s preference, it must not be ours. If this is a problem, give up steak. That meat actually is a mammal with soulful eyes, and the American appetite for consuming cow is helping to heat up the climate and destroy human life. Wait, maybe I should have started there. We\u2019re in a climate crisis. Give up the steak already, damn.\n\n5. Don\u2019t be a bragging pussy grabber.\n\nMentioned if there is something you do analogous to grabbing women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it on the Access Hollywood bus. For example, the other day at the library with my sons, I overheard a security guard complaining to another about having to pay child support. The second guard (here I\u2019m paraphrasing but absolutely not lying) said, \u201cMan, I got so many women pregnant, but none of them ever came to me looking for anything like that. None of them!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you may want to point a long, Obama-like finger at that admittedly African-American man and mutter a racist platitude about broken family values. Or you might want to give a sociological lecture about the aftermath of slave-family structure and contemporary assaults on black male masculinity. But that was this guy\u2019s grabbing of women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it to Billy Bush. Everyone has their version. Don\u2019t do yours.\n\n\n\n6. Prepare for public speaking engagements.\n\nRemember when Charlie Sheen had a public breakdown that got him fired from his multimillion-dollar job and decided to go on a 20-city tour titled, \u201cMy Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option\u201d? He launched in Detroit, primarily yelling a nonsensical string of catchphrases, including \u201ctiger blood\u201d and \u201cwinning.\u201d I would bet my next check that many people who paid for those tickets went on to enjoy the live performances of Candidate Cheeto. But unlike Candidate Cheeto, who became president, Sheen was rightfully booed off the stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheen\u2019s \u201ctour\u201d was the rehearsal for this hot hell right here. Trump rambles off the top belligerently at press conferences, when some poor overworked Nazi aide probably poured hours into a teleprompter script; he does it in front of the U.N.; he does it at white power campaign rallies (why is this orange individual having campaign rallies? I mean, Pence I could see ... ); he does it in front of piles of manila folders; he gets up in front of cameras feeding satellites throughout the galaxy. He says whatever ignorant shit occurs to him, and when members of his death cult cheer, he says more of it. He improvises; he scats. It\u2019s not jazz, though; it\u2019s acid for the eyes, ears and soul.\n\nAnd it is why you and I must prepare. Maybe not to speak to millions about the fate of their health care or jobs or very existence, but to give a presentation to our co-workers, to a speech at our houses of worship or for an oral presentation for class (as a professor, I really beseech you on this one; I\u2019ve died during countless oral presentations). Maybe don\u2019t do what I\u2019ve seen every person who \u201cwrote their own\u201d wedding vows do, which was very obviously make up some shit right there at the altar. Let\u2019s prepare, and rehearse and say it because Trump wouldn\u2019t do it, and because it\u2019s classy and it\u2019s right.\n\n7. Let President Obama go.\n\nI have actually found it surprising the degree to which Donald Trump\u2019s agenda consists of pinpointing actions taken by the previous president, poking at them with his tiny, graceless hands and leaving orange, dusty smears. This appears to be his only vision beyond looting the treasury and whipping up frenzied crowds of the very people who will be crushed to dust by his policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy counsel here is for those of us who can\u2019t get our mind off Obama for different reasons. Maybe you spent the last eight years saying, \u201cNigga didn\u2019t do nuthin but drone, deport and talk down to black men,\u201d and somehow the rise of Trump makes you even angrier about Obama\u2019s failings. Or maybe when things seem apocalyptic, you go to a special place in your mind where Barack and Michelle invite you to dinner and then put on Anita Baker\u2019s greatest hits, offer you a cordial and ask if you want to slip into something more comfortable.\n\nBut, most likely, you\u2019re hoping that man will save you. I know I am. You can keep crying neoliberalism and calling him a good Republican, but Obama is undeniable. He got elected with an African name and a black Chicago wife, and he managed to keep all those black people safe in the White House for eight years. Do you know how many people tried to jump that fence and make him stop inviting rappers up in there?\n\nThough I partake in many of the left\u2019s critiques of him, I can\u2019t help respecting him more since learning that his lean shoulder was all that was holding the door against the Purge we are living now. It makes me want him to full-on lead the opposition in Candidate Obama \u201908 mode, but more like a cross between Che Guevara, Malcolm X, Shirley Chisholm and Harriet Tubman\u2019s shotgun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he\u2019s done.\n\nHe\u2019s gone to a beautiful house in Kalorama, a Washington, D.C., neighborhood that is also home to Jared and Ivanka. He emerges every now and then to spit a few bars about health care, but mainly he saves his hot 16s for million-dollar speaking engagements with billion-dollar white people all around the world.\n\nThis is not a dis. He\u2019s commissioning the first black painters ever to do the presidential portraits, one of them the relatively unknown Amy Sherald. I know he loves us, but we\u2019re running on fumes here. Gil Scott-Heron once said there\u2019s no such thing as a superman. We have to save ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing makes us more like Donald Trump than being obsessed with Donald Trump, passing his name back and forth like a virus. Even if it feels like he is personally torturing you, you cannot let him continue to enjoy having achieved his lifelong goal of being this country\u2019s, and maybe the world\u2019s, most mesmerizing spectacle. This is a piss-poor show, and he\u2019s watching us watching it while doing a lot of diddling with little appendages.\n\nMore importantly, watching, clicking, losing sleep and fuming about this individual is not what will stop him (or the congressional Republicans goodlordamighty, whom I haven\u2019t even addressed here) from disastrously altering human history. But do you know what will stop him (and them)\u2014I mean, besides being less like Trump? Great.

It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cGodmother of Rock and Roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cForgotten Mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret.

And I Sorely Regret It\u201d in the coming weeks and months. This week alone, we\u2019ve watched Fox News become of a bacchanalia of teary epiphany, and we\u2019ve witnessed a parade of prominent Republicans twist themselves into logical origami denouncing Donald Trump while defending the people who ... voted for Trump.\n\nAnyway, as far as this burgeoning genre of Trumpcab Confessions goes, Krein\u2019s piece hits each of the right notes. He remains sober as he methodically and meticulously articulates why he believed Trump was worthy of his support.\n\n\n\nRather than recite paeans to American enterprise, he acknowledged that our \u201cinformation economy\u201d has delivered little wage or productivity growth. He was willing to criticize the bipartisan consensus on trade and pointed out the devastating effects of deindustrialization felt in many communities. He forthrightly addressed the foreign policy failures of both parties, such as the debacles in Iraq and Libya, and rejected the utopian rhetoric of \u201cdemocracy promotion.\u201d He talked about the issue of widening income inequality \u2014 almost unheard of for a Republican candidate \u2014 and didn\u2019t pretend that simply cutting taxes or shrinking government would solve the problem. He criticized corporations for offshoring jobs, attacked financial-industry executives for avoiding taxes and bemoaned America\u2019s reliance on economic bubbles over the last few decades. He blasted the Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz campaigns for insincerely mouthing focus-grouped platitudes while catering to their largest donors \u2014 and he was right. Voters loved that he was willing to buck conventional wisdom and the establishment. He flouted G.O.P. orthodoxy on entitlements, infrastructure spending and, at times, even health care and \u201cculture war\u201d issues like funding Planned Parenthood. His statements on immigration were often needlessly inflammatory, but he correctly diagnosed that our current system makes little sense for most Americans, as well as many immigrants, and seems designed to benefit the wealthy at the expense of working people.\n\nHe then acknowledges the existence of Trump\u2019s lack of decorum and penchant for racially inflammatory remarks, while also explaining why he believed Trump was just a little rough around the edges\u2014edges he thought would eventually smooth.\n\n\n\nFrom the very start of his run, one of the most serious charges against Mr. Trump was that he panders to racists. Many of his supporters, myself included, managed to convince ourselves that his more outrageous comments \u2014 such as the Judge Gonzalo Curiel controversy or his initial hesitance to disavow David Duke\u2019s endorsement \u2014 were merely Bidenesque gaffes committed during the heat of a campaign.\n\nAnd then, after a few hundred words explaining why his initial support was justified, the piece shifts to unabashed penitence as Krein expresses his regret for such an egregious error in judgment.\n\nThose of us who supported Mr. Trump were never so na\u00efve as to expect that he would transform himself into a model of presidential decorum upon taking office. But our calculation was that a few cringe-inducing tweets were an acceptable trade-off for a successful governing agenda. Yet after more than 200 days in office, Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior grows only more reprehensible. Meanwhile, his administration has no significant legislative accomplishments \u2014 and no apparent plan to deliver any. Wilbur Ross\u2019s Commerce Department has advanced some sensible and appropriately incremental changes to trade policy, but no long-term agenda has been articulated. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue\u2019s recently proposed legislation offers a sound basis for reforming immigration policy, but seems to have no prospects and has received comparatively little attention. The administration inexplicably downgraded infrastructure and corporate tax reform \u2014 issues with potentially broad-based support \u2014 to pursue a warmed-over version of Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal, which ended, predictably, in a humiliating failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs long as this roving, flaming port-a-potty continues to roam through the White House, there will be more serious pieces in serious publications penned by serious men and serious women seriously explaining why they no longer believe in or support the (deadly unserious) man who they voted president. And they\u2019ll generally be met with praise for doing the right thing and applause for being so damn adult and allowing their minds to change. And they can all go fly a kite. Over \u201cFuck How You Feel Now\u201d Lake, sitting on the picturesque \u201cHere\u2019s A Fucking Cookie\u201d coast.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything even remotely good to say about Donald Trump, it\u2019s that he hasn\u2019t allowed his political success to change him. The person he is now is exactly the person he\u2019s been since we\u2019ve known who Donald Trump is. And although what has come from the White House in the months since the election could possibly be considered \u201csurprising,\u201d the election of Trump nullifies this particular type of surprise. Because he is exactly who he said he is. And exactly who we\u2014the people who didn\u2019t vote for him\u2014said he was.\n\nBeing surprised at Donald Trump\u2014surprised enough for his actions to change your opinions about him in less than a year\u2014is like placing a puppy on a carpet and getting surprised when he shits on it. And then getting mad at the puppy, who looks at you like, I\u2019M A FUCKING PUPPY! EATING AND SHITTING ON FURRY THINGS ARE MY TWO FAVORITE THINGS TO DO! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU THINK I WAS GONNA DO ON THIS CARPET?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, despite the millions of people saying, \u201cNO, DON\u2019T PUT THAT PUPPY ON THE CARPET\u201d\u2014and despite this puppy literally saying, \u201cI WILL TOTALLY SHIT ON THAT CARPET, DUDE\u201d\u2014people like Krein chose to ignore them and now want some sort of laudatory fellatio for finally doing the right thing.

They reek of a fawning, confused attempt to normalize, empathize with and explain elements of American society that people of color, and white folks with even a rudimentary knowledge of history, have always known.\n\nAmerica is, at its core, a nasty, venal, selfish and racist culture. Yes, we have our spots of progress: the MLKs; the first black this; a major discrimination case is won; a few \u201cvery special episodes\u201d of Black-ish, etc. By and large, though, the long arc of history has generally bent toward crushing the necks of poor, weak and, especially, African-American citizens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question shouldn\u2019t be, why did millions of Americans vote for Donald Trump? That answer is obvious. The question should be, why have his core supporters stuck with him and, spoiler alert, why will they continue to stick with him no matter what he does over the next four to eight years?\n\nDo they believe he\u2019ll build that wall? Do they believe he\u2019ll bring back jobs? Do they believe he\u2019ll really \u201cMake America great again\u201d? Of course not. Trump voters don\u2019t believe in what Trump says. They don\u2019t care, and they don\u2019t have to. Trump voters already think that America is done, finished, final, a fatality; they figured that out a long time ago. They didn\u2019t elect Donald Trump to fix America; they elected Donald Trump to make sure that as America falls, white folks go down swinging.\n\nMost Trump-voter articles fall into three categories:\n\n1. What motivated people to vote for Trump: The answer is usually some variation of \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d and \u201ccultural anxiety,\u201d which is just fancy code-speech for racists. These folks are different from just plain ol\u2019 Republicans who were just voting party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Why Barack Obama voters switched from Obama to Trump: The answer is generally the same (with a smattering of \u201cI hated Hillary Clinton\u201d), with buzzwords like \u201ccultural anxiety\u201d and fear of Black Lives Matter mixed in. This has baffled many mainstream white commentators and journalists who don\u2019t understand how someone could move from a black president who touts an open multicultural society to a racist, sexist president who advocates ethnocentrism and suspicion.\n\nIt really shouldn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t the No. 1-rated Cosby Show give way to Roseanne? Wasn\u2019t the \u201990s Michael Jordan era followed by the mainstreaming of Confederate-flag-winking NASCAR? Didn\u2019t the insanely popular racial and gender diversity of America\u2019s Next Top Model give birth to the ethnocentric buffoonery and latent bigotry of Jersey Shore and Duck Dynasty? To paraphrase Van Jones, the \u201cwhitewash\u201d is real, and we\u2019ve seen it before.\n\n\n\n3. What it will take for Trump voters to abandon him: These stories involve putting together some collection of mostly white Trump voters (and usually one black guy in a suit from the Steve Harvey Collection), who are presented with lie after lie that Trump has told, and the journalist sits there gobsmacked as these people calmly stick with Trump no matter what. It\u2019s like the Michael Jackson/R. Kelly black-jury-selection sketch on Chappelle\u2019s Show, when they ask Dave if he thinks O.J. is guilty and he says, \u201cMy blackness will not permit me to make a statement like that.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite Trump supporters aren\u2019t going to come out and just say, \u201cThat black guy and his pretty wife and kids made me feel bad about myself, and Trump is my way of getting back at him.\u201d The rules of whiteness prohibit such honesty.\n\nThe reason these analyses fail is that they don\u2019t get to the root of white-American psyche over the last two decades or so. Imagine you\u2019re a 35-year-old white guy in 1999. The world is your oyster; the next 15 years, your income, life and opportunities are going to skyrocket. Then, boom: Columbine, the white suburbs are no longer safe; 2000, the electoral system is a mess; 2001, America is no longer safe from terror; 2002, the economy is rigged for big business like Enron; and 2005, America\u2019s party city New Orleans gets flooded and the government botches the recovery.\n\nAfter all that, the only way to fix the country is by handing it over to a handsome, smart black guy with a funny name. How emasculating! Eight years later, you\u2019ve got black folks protesting, gays on every television network, and even black athletes, from college to the pros, are demanding to be heard. To quote the late Bill Paxton, \u201cGame over, man; game over!\u201d America is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201980s aren\u2019t coming back; the era of white male cultural hegemony is only at 97 percent instead of 100 percent, and there\u2019s no way to change it. Trump voters know this. They know that manufacturing jobs that pay a living wage aren\u2019t coming back. They know that a wall is impractical. They know that terrorism is impossible to stop. When you know the inevitable is coming, when you know that you have to face change or become irrelevant, you either change or you kick and scream and drag every tablecloth and curtain in a temper tantrum on your way out.\n\nDonald Trump is that temper tantrum. This is why Trump voters are still angry. Why they\u2019re still stabbing college students and hanging nooses and protesting at Confederate statues and can\u2019t stop talking about Obama and Hillary. Those aren\u2019t the actions of optimistic winners who believe America\u2019s best days are ahead.\n\nTrump supporters still believe that America is ruined, soiled, tainted and irredeemable. No matter what America says to Trump now, his voters know that she dated a black guy for eight years and she liked it, and she still thinks about him. Why do you think conservatives are always calling their enemies \u201ccuckolds\u201d? It\u2019s projection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why poll after poll shows supporters sticking with Trump no matter how many times he fails or completely betrays his policy promises. They never expected him to change anything, and they never will. All they need to know is that he drives liberals crazy (and to them, \u201cliberals\u201d are anyone who isn\u2019t a Trump supporter), that he\u2019s white and male, and doesn\u2019t challenge Americans to grow up and change.\n\nThis kind of political nihilism has the potential to destroy this country and severely destabilize the world. A leader whose supporters don\u2019t expect him to deliver on promises and who don\u2019t care if he\u2019s honest, and whose greatest value is seen not in what he delivers but in how he antagonizes political enemies, is no leader. He\u2019s a political cudgel, a temper tantrum from an electorate that votes out of spite, not hope; anger, not ambition; disdain, not destiny.\n\nThey just want to make sure they go down swinging, and if that drives the rest of the world off the cliff, so be it.

If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cGodmother of Rock and Roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cForgotten Mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret.

If you voted for a man who campaigned on xenophobia, racism, sexism and other strains of bigotry, you either share his prejudices or you are complicit in them. The former makes you an audacious racist; the latter, a bystander, which in and of itself is a racist act. Nothing about that reality has changed since Habanero Hitler was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election or officially sworn in to office.\n\n\n\nBut in senseless fashion, some continue to advocate on behalf of the big basket of deplorables responsible for the ongoing mess that is the 45th president of the United States. Only a week ago, I asked how many more of these disingenuous and intellectually dishonest diatribes will we collectively be subjected to? The\n\nNew York Times swiftly flew in with an answer: to infinity and fucking beyond.\n\n\n\nIn the news analysis \u201cAre Liberals Helping Trump?\u201d Sabrina Tavernise, a national correspondent for the Times, echoes all of the greatest hits associated with any defense of 45\u2019s supporters.\n\nFirst, there is the introduction of the 45 voter, who in this case is Jeffrey Medford, \u201ca small-business owner in South Carolina\u201d who apparently \u201cvoted reluctantly for Donald Trump.\u201d Next we get his rationale for helping to elect a monster who is presently trying to reintroduce a travel ban aimed at people from primarily Muslim countries while stripping protection of transgender children in public schools. For Medford, it was the sentiment that \u201cas a conservative, he felt the need to choose the Republican.\u201d\n\nThen comes the bullshit: the idea that assigning culpability is cruel and unjust, not to mention the cries of victimhood. Tavernise argues:\n\n\n\nMr. Medford should be a natural ally for liberals trying to convince the country that Mr. Trump was a bad choice. But it is not working out that way. Every time Mr. Medford dips into the political debate\u2014either with strangers on Facebook or friends in New York and Los Angeles\u2014he comes away feeling battered by contempt and an attitude of moral superiority. \u201cWe\u2019re backed into a corner,\u201d said Mr. Medford, 46, whose business teaches people to be filmmakers. \u201cThere are at least some things about Trump I find to be defensible. But they are saying: \u2018Agree with us 100 percent or you are morally bankrupt. You\u2019re an idiot if you support any part of Trump.\u2019 \u201d He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t choose a side. They put me on one.\u201d\n\nHow ironic that a supporter of a man who campaigned on absolutes like \u201cbuild a wall\u201d and \u201cMuslim ban\u201d suddenly longs for nuance and gray areas. In any event, Tavernise paints a picture that likely resonates with the likes of the Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza, who once tweeted, \u201cThe assumption that \u2018Trump voter = racist\u2019 is deeply corrosive to democracy.\u201d Cillizza went on to add, \u201cThere is nothing more maddening\u2014and counterproductive\u2014to me than saying that Trump\u2019s 59 million votes were all racist. Ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for the former host of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart, who, in an interview with Charlie Rose on CBS This Morning shortly after the election, argued:\n\n\n\nI thought Donald Trump disqualified himself at numerous points. But there is now this idea that anyone who voted for him is\u2014has to be defined by the worst of his rhetoric. Like, there are guys in my neighborhood that I love, that I respect, that I think have incredible qualities, who are not afraid of Mexicans and not afraid of Muslims and not afraid of blacks. They\u2019re afraid of their insurance premiums.\n\nMany of those people are presently screaming at Republican members of Congress at various town halls across the country. Their anger is understandable until you realize that they voted for someone who vowed on the campaign trail to repeal their health care program. Regardless of their purported motivation, though, Mexicans, Muslims and blacks were rightly fearful of their choice for president\u2014and their support shows that we were expendable. They may not have been afraid, but they rejected their own humanity when they voted for a man who categorized one group as rapists, the other as terrorists, and the last as folks who live in war zones in this country in desperate need of law and order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, though: It\u2019s wrong to highlight what their votes meant for the rest of us.\n\n\n\nTavernise writes:\n\n\n\nLiberals may feel energized by a surge in political activism, and a unified stance against a president they see as irresponsible and even dangerous. But that momentum is provoking an equal and opposite reaction on the right. In recent interviews, conservative voters said they felt assaulted by what they said was a kind of moral Bolshevism\u2014the belief that the liberal vision for the country was the only right one. Disagreeing meant being publicly shamed. Protests and righteous indignation on social media and in Hollywood may seem to liberals to be about policy and persuasion. But moderate conservatives say they are having the opposite effect, chipping away at their middle ground and pushing them closer to Mr. Trump. \u201cThe name calling from the left is crazy,\u201d said Bryce Youngquist, 34, who works in sales for a tech start-up in Mountain View, Calif., a liberal enclave where admitting you voted for Mr. Trump is a little like saying in the 1950s that you were gay. \u201cThey are complaining that Trump calls people names, but they turned into some mean people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo her credit, Tavernise\u2019s article is not like the other various op-eds that have flooded the New York Times opinion section in that she is not forcefully presenting a point of view. Even so, her analysis fits right in with the bevy of other pieces trying to absolve 45 supporters of their sins. Her essay is as exhausting a read as all the others. Like, say, another New York Times op-ed, entitled, \u201cSorry, Liberals. Bigotry Didn\u2019t Elect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHad Hillary Clinton campaigned just a little bit more in Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, the 70,000 or so votes she lost in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would have made her president. There\u2019s also the fact that had the Democratic Party itself pushed back harder on voter suppression in those three states and other states, perhaps the party wouldn\u2019t be in as dismal a state as it currently finds itself in. And though \u201cshoulda, coulda, woulda\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much in hindsight, had Clinton won, I highly doubt that the black women who would have carried her into history would be getting as much attention as those who voted for a man nearly 3 million behind in the popular vote.\n\nWhere are the essays advocating on their behalf? What about the trans kids and adults who live in fear? What about those, like me, who constantly wonder what an Attorney General Jeff Sessions means for our safety and the remnants of our so-called rights and liberties? What about the millions of undocumented workers of Latino, African and Asian descent who have already started being practically hunted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is happening, and mainstream publications are interviewing 45\u2019s supporters who bitch and moan about not being able to enjoy Meryl Streep movies and social media anymore? To hell with those people, and to hell with these attempts to run filters through the ugliness of their actions.

Labor Day has come and gone, and we are facing a credible possibility that the next four years of the American executive branch will be led by the sentient chunk of peach fuzz by the name of Donald J. Trump.\n\nAt this point, there have been millions of words written about the Trump campaign, its supporters, Trump himself, and how it has made a collective mockery of the media cycle and general politics writ large, spurning the presumptive necessity of things such as accuracy, grasp of policy, and general human decency. We passed the \u201cfacts don't matter\u201d train several months ago, and we\u2019re riding this scam all the way to November 8th. The Trump Foundation is a big gofundme hoax? Sure! Trump is stumping at Black churches with the anthromorphized toilet bowl of Fox News? Why not! Trump claiming he laid the birther scandal to rest, a narrative that was about as effective as Chris Christie\u2019s lap band surgery? Have at it!\n\nHOWEVER, I draw the line at candy. Confectionary sweets the likes of Skittles have no place in political propaganda \u2014 especially nonsensically constructed metaphors equating them to Syrian refugees.\n\nBesides getting into the fact that Americans engage in culinary behavior that brings them closer to death every day, rendering the analogy moot (see: me with hot wings), Skittles are too decent of a candy to be co-opted by the Make America Great Again ilk of America. Not to say that they\u2019re an exceptional candy, per se. They\u2019re decent enough to be passable in small doses, but still overrated for its quality. Skittles are the Survivor\u2019s Remorse of candies - mediocre, but still too good for Trump/Pence 2016.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of trash candies we can gladly trade for to retain the rights to the Skittle brands with the greater American public. If Trump\u2019s fanbase insists on claiming a set of candies for their very own, I would suggest one of the following:\n\n1. Tootsie Rolls\n\nThey\u2019re shaped like poo and the disgusting aftertaste never seems to go away, no matter how much water you drink. They\u2019re also constantly in the candy dish of every annoying Black great-uncle who\u2019s a secret Republican.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Candy Corn\n\nBecause Candy Corn is the devil and so is Trump\u2019s hairstylist. It also shares qualities with Trump\u2019s face with respect to its wax consistency. If you like Candy Corn you are guaranteed to not like nice things, like immigration rights or equal rights for women. Off to Trump you go.\n\n3. Twizzlers\n\nDoes anyone under the age of 60 eat Twizzlers? I don\u2019t know why gnawing on tart rope is a beloved pasttime of the denture-laden community, but that candy can get out of my Caucasian house and scam it\u2019s way into theirs. YES RED VINES COUNT TOO. Licorice is nasty and I rebuke it. Debate your aunties that still think homosexuality is a lifestyle they have the right to disagree with, and send them along to the GOP with that trash ass candy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Marshmallow Peeps\n\nPeeps are God\u2019s silent retribution for the centuries of pillaging that was done in the name of Christianity, I swear it. Every Easter until the end of time, scores of children are forced to endure the abominable tradition of eating multiple artificially flavored sponges shaped like bunnies, as if politely taking a bite of the deacon\u2019s wife\u2019s sweet potato pie after service isn\u2019t enough.

Officers responded to a medical emergency in a home at approximately 12:40 p.m. First responders could not revive Berry, and he was pronounced dead at 1:26 p.m. The cause of death was not known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Edward Anderson Berry Sr. was born on Oct. 18, 1926, in San Jose, Calif., but his family moved to St. Louis just after his birth. Interested in music early on, he sang in the church choir and school glee club. Berry taught himself how to play the guitar in junior high school.\n\nJust before graduating from high school, Berry was convicted of armed robbery and spent three years in reform school. He married within a year of his release in 1947 and worked as a carpenter and hairstylist while also playing guitar with different bands. In 1953 he joined a jazz-and-blues band, Sir John\u2019s Trio, and played at the Cosmopolitan Club in St. Louis for the next three years. He made his mark with the group, changing its name to the Chuck Berry Combo and the musical style to a fast-paced mix of country, pop, and rhythm and blues.\n\nIn 1955 he went to see Muddy Waters in concert in Chicago, and afterward he asked the blues legend for advice about making a record. Muddy advised him to seek out Leonard and Phil Chess of Chicago\u2019s Chess Records. He did, and they ended up signing Berry, who quickly had a string of top 10 hits, including \u201cMaybellene,\u201d \u201cRoll Over Beethoven,\u201d \u201cRock and Roll Music,\u201d \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and \u201cCarol.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerry\u2019s ability to draw in white teenagers without alienating his core black audience\u2014the first black rock-\u2019n\u2019-roller to do so\u2014led to his tremendous crossover success. He became known for the flair and showmanship of his live performances, which featured his famed \u201cduck walk\u201d along with an infectious mix of rhythmic blues and country with a dash of witty lyrics.\n\nBerry, always a shrewd businessman, reveled in his wealth and fame, opening Berry Park, a custom-built estate/amusement park in Wentzville, Mo., in 1957. The property had a guitar-shaped pool, golf course, hotel rooms and a nightclub. He also steadily built his beloved fleet of Cadillacs.\n\nIn 1961, however, Berry was once again in trouble with the criminal-justice system: He was found guilty of transporting a teenage girl across state lines for immoral purposes. During his stint in prison from 1962 to 1963, he completed his high school education and wrote songs such as \u201cTulane\u201d and \u201cNadine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch tunes, however, were not enough to maintain Berry\u2019s popularity in the 1960s against the tidal wave of new young artists like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. The Beatles even recorded versions of his classic songs, including \u201cRoll Over Beethoven.\u201d Berry switched to Mercury Records in 1966 to boost his career, but the move did little to help. He became a regular at rock-revival tours but ended up having his biggest hit in 1972\u2014his only No. 1 hit, as it turns out\u2014with \u201cMy Ding-a-Ling,\u201d which sold 2 million copies.\n\nBerry, a complicated, hugely charismatic man, could also be moody and not always easy to work with, which comes across in the re-release of the 1986 film Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll, a documentary of a concert celebrating Berry\u2019s 60th birthday. In the introduction, director Taylor Hackford says that Berry \u201cwasn\u2019t always cooperative.\u201d In subsequent interviews, producers and crew members\u2014along with musicians such as Stones guitarist Keith Richards and Bruce Springsteen\u2014shared their own perceptions of and experiences with Berry as a man and a legend, and the personal stories weren\u2019t always flattering. The evidence of Berry\u2019s onstage performance, however, makes it clear that his peerless skills as an entertainer were never in doubt.\n\nIn 1979 he landed in a California prison for failing to pay income taxes. Berry faced more legal troubles later in life when police raided his estate in 1990 on tips that he was selling cocaine; the charges were later dropped. He also settled out of court a class action lawsuit by women who claimed that they had been videotaped in bathrooms at Berry Park without their consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problems in his personal life did not stop Berry from receiving his share of accolades for his massive contributions to music. In addition to receiving a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984, he was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986. Berry received Kennedy Center Honors in 2000, and his name and music regularly appear on Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s \u201cGreatest \u2026 of All Time\u201d lists, including the 100 Greatest Artists (No. 5), 100 Greatest Guitarists (No. 6), 500 Greatest Albums (No. 21) and 500 Greatest Songs (Nos. 7, 18, 97, 129, 277 and 383). \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d also took the No. 1 spot in the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs category.\n\nMon\u00e9e Fields-White is a freelance writer and editor based in Los Angeles.\n\n", "keywords": ["rock", "songs", "music", "school", "father", "chuck", "berrys", "st", "park", "90", "greatest", "dies", "n", "roll", "berry"], "polarity": 0.16798538961038958, "subjectivity": 0.4779055944055945},

One of those things that absolutely go Full-On Embarrassing Dad is singing Rick James and Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d at the top of my lungs WHENEVER it comes on. And because Apple knows my heart, I can pull it up whenever, wherever, whatever the spirit hits me, and buddy, it hits me, baby, not one more time, but all the times.\n\n\u201cEbony Eyes\u201d was released in 1983 and was a single off of Rick James\u2019 Cold Blooded album, featuring the title track, one of Rick\u2019s signature hit songs. James\u2019 career is interesting in that he\u2019s considered a legend in two games, like Pee Wee Kirkland (his drug use was legendary back then), but the most significant part of his career happened between 1978 and 1985. As opposed to other larger-than-life artists whose hits spanned several decades, James made a really big splash over a relatively short amount of time.\n\nWith Motown and music legend Robinson in tow, James wrote an ode to black women that was slower tempo and more traditional R&B than most of his hits.\n\nWhile James was known for the punk-funk stylings of his larger hits, \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d saw him smooth it out and keep it mellow, mellow. Robinson and James traded stanzas, and most of the hook duties went to James, creating one of the absolutely most perfect karaoke songs of all time, since James\u2019 singing is more performance than it is good. And that\u2019s really what karaoke is all about. I love Rick James; that was not a shot.\n\nWhen James and Robinson really ramp up the energy toward the end of the song, this is when my soul fully embraces all that the song has to offer. From roughly 3:30 until the end of the song, every single time James sings \u201cEbony eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyes of miii-iiiiiiiiiine .... ,\u201d I feel the spirit of Mary Jane.\n\nWhile it is nowhere near Rick James\u2019 most famous or most successful song, I\u2019d stack it against \u201cYou and I,\u201d \u201cSuper Freak,\u201d \u201cGive It to Me Baby\u201d or \u201cCold Blooded\u201d as his second-best song of all time, since \u201cMary Jane\u201d is hands down his best song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with \u201cEbony Eyes,\u201d we have an ode to black women being sung by the smooth crooner and the super freak, who shot a nonsensical eight-minute mini movie (the year after Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller,\u201d no less) about their plane, Ebony Eyes, crashing on a beach because of bad weather, and the two of them singing about their ebony-eyed angels back home.\n\nThey build spears, have tiki torches; there\u2019s a parrot; they shave; James throws an SOS note into the ocean; and then a trunk full of white suits\u2014literally, white suits\u2014shows up, they shoot flares, and their women show up on a yacht and rescue them.\n\nIt\u2019s bad, real bad, Joe Jackson.

The cuddle buddies we had for the winter can be turned loose, and we can get back to being fabulously single and ready to mingle.\n\n\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t need some amount of satisfaction and release, and for those moments when no one is around, a vibrator can come through in a pinch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt can\u2019t be just any vibrator, however. There are different types of vibrators that serve different types of needs, and being familiar with them all will help you make your choice (or choices) on your next visit to the toy store.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s not your mother\u2019s vibrator anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clitoris contains 8,000 nerve endings. For many women, it is the center of vaginal pleasure. It stands to reason that there would be a great many vibrators made specifically for clitoral stimulation.\n\nIn our mothers\u2019 day, all the vibrators looked the same\u2014boring. They were functional and operated on D batteries \u2014 which could make them very inconvenient if and when the batteries ran out.\n\nVibrators for clitoral stimulation have grown up and gotten more advanced these days.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy personal favorite is the Magic Wand. It used to be known as the Hitachi Magic Wand, but Hitachi didn\u2019t like all the attention it was getting from the popular sex toy, so it rebranded it as \u201cthe Magic Wand.\u201d\n\nThe Magic Wand doesn\u2019t work on batteries; it plugs into an electrical outlet, which means you can get hours of pleasure from this bad boy. There are two speeds, but I can tell you from personal experience that you want to keep it on low. High speed will likely numb your nerves out, and that won\u2019t be fun for anyone.\n\n\n\nIt gives a very good (and sometimes very quick) orgasm, and it is well worth the cost to invest in one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor women who want more than a clitoral orgasm.\n\nThere are times, of course, when a girl wants more than a clitoral orgasm, and for those times, there are vibrators like the Fifty Shades of Grey Greedy Girl G-Spot Rabbit Vibrator, which provides both clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne part of the vibrator can be inserted in your vagina, and while that end is doing its job on the inside, the \u201crabbit\u201d ears stimulate the clitoris.\n\nNow, I know we have been told that squirting orgasms are just pee (I still don\u2019t believe this shit; damn the experts), but please believe me\u2014this vibrator is a squirting-orgasm inducer. I love it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vibrator is rechargeable\u2014which again means that you don\u2019t need batteries, and you can get hours of pleasure from it. The internal vibrator and the rabbit ears operate on two separate motors, which means you can control the speed of your orgasms so that one doesn\u2019t happen before the other, if you know what I mean.\n\n\n\nIf you do want to play with a partner.\n\nI was just kidding earlier when I said we would be kicking our cuddle buddies to the side. Not all of us are going to do that, and if you want to engage in a little bit of couples play, there are vibrators for that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are vibrating cock rings, and there are strap-ons that include a small bullet vibrator for the person wearing the strap-on, so both partners can get pleasured at once.\n\nDon\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it; that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nWhichever type of toy you choose, whether you are going on a solo orgasmic journey or one with a partner, be sure to shop around and find the right one for the type of pleasure you are looking for. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a little extra money on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike bad sex, a bad vibrator is a frustrating and disappointing experience.

The moment you sit in the chair and the stylist wraps the cape around you is the moment you begin to be magically transformed.\n\n\n\nBut the mythology\u2014and reality\u2014of black beauty shops isn\u2019t just about the stylists; it\u2019s the culture, the rhythm. It\u2019s the lady up the street who takes lunch and dinner soul food orders and the brotha with bootleg movies stopping through on a Saturday morning; the gospel music in some spots and the hip-hop or trap music in others. It\u2019s generations of women from one family either working in the shop or getting their hair done in that same shop. For many black women, the shop is a second home where we create family ties through nurturing our hair.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw Chris Rock\u2019s 2009 documentary Good Hair, I was surprised to learn that black hair care is a multibillion-dollar business. Most of us don\u2019t think about those numbers; what\u2019s always been most important to me\u2014as I\u2019m sure it is for other folks\u2014is to find a shop that aesthetically makes me feel comfortable and at home. I want to be in a place where the business practices are exceptional and the stylist cares about my hair. But for me, the black beauty shop experience is also complicated by my identities as a lesbian, butch woman and a black/biracial person.\n\nI grew up in the black church\u2014which meant long services, skeevy deacons, wilding-out preachers\u2019 kids (PKs) and older women who absolutely ran the church, regardless of the pastor. But one of the things I remember most from my religious education is that a woman\u2019s hair is her \u201ccrowning glory,\u201d which meant you had to be very cautious about how you cut or styled your hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a kid, I had thick, curly locks that at one point extended down to my butt. People gushed over my hair, but quite frankly, I hated it. I never quite understood what to do with it, and it never held a relaxer like my friends\u2019 hair did.\n\nAs I got older, I felt even more alienated from black beauty shops because of my own relationship with race. I was adopted into a black family, so I had a clear understanding of my blackness from a very young age. But it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I began to explore the nuances of being light-skinned, black and also biracial. The push and pull of being accepted by black folk who weren\u2019t sure whether I was \u201cblack enough\u201d felt constant. And that push and pull extended to the relationship I had with my hair, and my identity as a butch woman.\n\nFor me, long hair was not part of my butch identity. It indicated a femininity that felt uncomfortable, and I needed a stylist and salon that understood and respected that. The choice to cut my hair was the most liberating feeling I\u2019d ever experienced, aside from coming out to the world and myself. But it took a long time for me to find the right person and the right shop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been in hair salons with a heavy evangelical Christian energy, where people consider Harry Potter \u201cblack magic\u201d and implore folks to beware of the churches with rainbow flags, because that\u2019s where \u201cthose people\u201d go to church.\n\nI\u2019ve been in salons where the stylist criticized my hair just for being my hair. I\u2019ve been in salons where I was simply a number in a chair. And, of course, we\u2019ve all had a salon experience where your appointment is at 9 a.m. and you don\u2019t get out of the chair until 5 p.m.\n\nAt a certain point, I knew I needed a place with a mixture of great energy, client-centered service and stylists who wanted me to love my hair as much as they loved doing hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was lucky to find Consciously Beautiful salon in St. Paul, Minn., through a friend who wears her hair natural in intricate braided styles. My relationship with stylist and owner Marla Smith is intense and intimate; she knows me almost as well as my partner of 18 years.\n\nShe was the first stylist to tell me that my hair has an actual identity (spiral corkscrew 3a), and the only stylist to identify my partner\u2019s formerly inflamed scalp as a sign of lactose intolerance and recommend that she lay off dairy for a while. Recently, she recommended that I use a little coconut oil before adding product so that my hair doesn\u2019t dry out in the harsh Minnesota winter.\n\nMarla says she decided to go into hair care because she wanted to do something she could be passionate about. And though she loves black women\u2019s hair, her clientele is diverse and spans different types of identities and people. And most importantly, her spot is a place that has great healing energy. Every month, I leave her spot relaxed, rejuvenated and filled with joy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know there are women who work in barbershops, and butch lesbians and straight women alike who get their hair cut in barbershops, but my personal politic is that I don\u2019t belong in black barbershops. There are so few places where black men are able to be vulnerable with one another that it just doesn\u2019t feel right for me to be there.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also had plenty of moments where I felt out of place in black beauty shops. I\u2019ve often felt like I was eavesdropping on black women\u2019s vulnerability in a space where femme black women have felt their safest to talk about their partners, their children, their relationships with their mothers and other women in their lives, and maybe\u2014at their most raucous\u2014whether they should be the first one to text their new love back after a night of getting their backs blown out.\n\nMy place in black beauty shops has often been fraught with deciding what part of my identity must take precedence over the other. At this point in my life, I feel lucky I no longer have to worry about that, but that\u2019s not the case for every butch woman. Understanding our place within black and primarily femme women\u2019s spaces can be complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I love the scents of black beauty salons and the energy of black women. We are divine, complex individuals\u2014even in our most hood and ratchet moments\u2014and in those spaces, we find ways to make joy and community.\n\nThankfully, I\u2019ve found a space\u2014a space where my stylist literally and figuratively weaves magic\u2014where I don\u2019t have to decide which of my identities gets to show up. For Marla, I am Stephanie: black/biracial, butch, lesbian, a client she respects, and whose success she roots for.

The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cGodmother of Rock and Roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cForgotten Mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended.

From a black actor winning for the first time in decades in the drama category to a black comedian winning in a comedy series directed and written by all black people, one could say that the event was the most inclusive and representative of black people in the 69 years of the show.\n\n\n\nThe real highlight of the night came when Lena Waithe won her award for comedy writing, becoming the first black woman in the history of the Emmys to ever win in that category. What made the win so special for many was knowing that Waithe utilized elements of her own coming-out experience in co-writing the \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode that won in that category for the show Master of None.\n\n\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Waithe not only called on the need to go beyond diversity conversation topics in entertainment, but also went on to make a special mention of her \u201cLGBTQIA family,\u201d specifically making mention of the fact that we need to be more visible and vocal about the right for LGBTQIA people to exist.\n\n\n\nThe problem?\n\n\n\nAlmost every news media outlet acknowledged her black identity first while only mentioning her queer identity as an afterthought. For folks like myself, who see both a person\u2019s queer and black identity as synonymous, I was left to wonder why media outlets often acknowledge the greatness that is, in fact, being black, but rarely acknowledge the beauty that is being both black and queer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember once having a colleague who identified as both black and queer tell me that she often felt like she had to choose between her black and queer identity. She shared with me that once a white co-worker asked her if she was \u201cblack today or queer today,\u201d making it seem that her identity as a queer black cisgender woman was something that could be selected like puzzle pieces.\n\nHearing this, it made me think about the work that black scholars Jamie Washington and Vernon Wall have done around the both/and, and/or complex (pdf). Both scholars explain that often black queer people are made to feel as if they aren\u2019t whole and will have to choose one identity over another in order to feel recognized or validated in certain spaces.\n\n\n\nThe bigger issue: On most days, black queer people are often forced to live between the lines of their marginalized identity, being made to feel as if they are too black to be queer or too queer to be black. When society or media fails to recognize black identity and queer identity as being synonymous, we further marginalize their existence. As Corin Peterson stated, most queer black people will spend most of their lives never feeling completely accepted, being caught in the middle of their intersecting identities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I find to be even more interesting in times like these is how both media and society use the word intersectionality (pdf), coined by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, but will often leave out the oppressive and discriminatory ways in which we treat black people when we begin discussing one\u2019s queer identity.\n\n\n\nWhen we address Lena Waithe as just a black woman who briefly mentioned her queer identity, or tell black people that they should leave their sexuality out of public discourse, then we begin to embrace the dangerous elements of identity politics, which often add to the oppression of black queer individuals.\n\nFurther, we begin to perpetuate this idea that there is no need to recognize the intersections of black queer people\u2019s identity (specifically, black women) and that one identity takes precedence over the other. As Crenshaw stated, this leads to treating race, gender and other identity categories as \u201cvestiges of bias.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all, we have to challenge mainstream media to start seeing black queer people as whole. Regardless of what you might believe, every person deserves the right to be seen as a full individual. We must challenge the notion that someone should have to choose between their racial and sexual identity because Audre Lorde tells us that regardless of how we identify, we are all complicated people leading complicated lives.\n\n\n\nIf we can celebrate and embrace Ellen DeGeneres fully in both her white and queer identity for all the work she has done for the LGBTQIA community, then Lena Waithe deserves to be celebrated for all the work she has done just by being visible and forthcoming about both her racial and sexual identity.", "keywords": ["woman", "queer", "lgbtqia", "work", "reminder", "identity", "lena", "waithe", "black", "media", "need"], "polarity": 0.05938654841093859, "subjectivity": 0.4797038327526132},

For many of us, this statement, albeit true, often lacks the full context and explanation of how both offensive terms are still derived from white supremacy, colonization and systems of oppression that create pseudo-hierarchies within marginalized populations.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite context, it is still my truth that as black queer people, we have a real fear of the state and of our own community. However, the role that colonization plays in blacks\u2019 assimilation into white society can\u2019t be dismissed as the reason we struggle to find safety within our community. We were colonized to follow the respectable order of white society, pipelined into a system already in place as a means to our own survival. The structure of white supremacy places white hetero men above white hetero women, who are above white LGB people, who are above white transgender people. This, in most cases has been adopted by our community and used to set up a black hierarchy that places black queer lives in danger.\n\n\n\nFor black LGBTQ folks, we sit at the bottom of that pyramid in our community, with black trans women being the most oppressed group. Murders against the trans community have reached an all-time high. On Nov. 29, Brooklyn BreYanna became the 27th black trans woman to be killed this year.\n\nThis is a real problem within our communities.\n\nWith no reform around toxic masculinity\u2014and an entrenched refusal to have hard conversations that are necessary to free us all\u2014we have failed to create safe environments for trans people not only to exist but also to thrive as valuable members of society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiovanni Melton, 14, was recently murdered by his father for being gay. It is a story that shook black LGBTQ folks to the core, a reminder that many of us survived. This story brought home many feelings that black LGBTQ people feel as soon as they walk out the house in the morning and, in this case, before they can even get out of bed.\n\nI was sold a false narrative. I was told \u201cit gets better,\u201d as if becoming an adult would change the years of ridicule I had endured my entire life, and introduce me to a world that would be fully accepting of my gender and sex identity. At 32, I now know that I take my life in my hands when I dress a certain way, or have mannerisms not accepted by a masculine-centered society. I\u2019ve been called a faggot walking to the gym, walking to the train, on Twitter, in the comments of my articles, by people of shared melanin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that it\u2019s all part of a conditioning process, which has taught us to oppress those who can\u2019t easily assimilate into whiteness. In the world we inhabit, those of us who aren\u2019t so-called respectable Negroes are always frantically trying to outrun death\u2014and too many of us lose. Those of us who cloak ourselves in the mantle of respectability are always surprised when the noose encircles their necks.\n\nDespite the lies we\u2019ve been force-fed, America has and will never see the Negro as a person worthy of respect; the condemnation of our own will inevitably hurt any chance we have of ever reaching collective freedom, a freedom that the state works to deny us on a daily basis. The state\u2019s relentless attempts to harm marginalized people using various systems of oppression, instead of one fatal blow, leads to death by a thousand paper cuts. These cuts come even harder for queer people as we deal with an intersection of identities that creates multiple oppressive systems that continue to harm us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHIV funding is being threatened because the face has become that of the black women and black gay men. Conversely, the opioid epidemic is considered a national health crisis because of the white bodies it primarily harms.\n\nApproval of gay marriage only brought about the affirmation of people living in that chosen identity, as they refuse to pass ENDA, which would protect us from job discrimination.\n\nThe socioeconomic status of queer black people leaves too many of us underpaid in positions similar to those of our white counterparts; yet even as homelessness continues to be a critical issue for those who are black and LGBTQ, it continues to largely be ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no \u201cAmerican dream\u201d that has ever envisioned black people as being a part of the narrative. And, if for one moment, we ever allow ourselves to believe in that dream, like Martin Luther King\u2019s realization in 1967\u2014one year before his assassination\u2014we eventually wake up to a nightmare.\n\nHashtag after hashtag, march after march, I am reminded that my blackness is a threat to the state and has been so since our kidnapping to these shores over 400 years ago. Mass incarceration continues to destroy black and brown families in such brutal ways that it seems impossible that our communities will ever fully recover.\n\nWith the continued radical diligence of committed activists, there will be a collective community transformation centered in the truth that #BlackLivesMatter must include those lives which fall outside the margins of heteronormative safety and acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealth care disparities and discrimination have kept our people uninsured, unhealthy and unwilling to trust a medical system built on us remaining that way. Cops, prosecutors, judges and laws continue to perpetuate an injustice system intent on killing black bodies on camera with no resulting consequences beyond GoFundMe payouts, early retirements and not guilty verdicts over and over again. The recent Michael Slager verdict may be an extraordinarily rare example of justice being served, but as Malcolm X said: \u201cIf you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, there\u2019s no progress. If you pull it all the way out that\u2019s not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven\u2019t even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound. They won\u2019t even admit the knife is there.\u201d\n\nNo, they still won\u2019t even admit the knife is there.\n\nThe state tells us that Korryn Gaines and Sandra Bland were too loud and had it coming, that Philando Castile did everything right but wasn\u2019t white, and that Freddie Gray apparently killed himself. Lash after lash we take as black folks from the state, but we are conditioned to believe that if we can live to 80 or 90 years old in oppression, then we had a long, wonderful life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow envision living that life at the intersection of blackness and queerness.\n\nHaving the understanding that this is all a byproduct of white supremacy doesn\u2019t make me any less fearful of my community. However, it does make me hopeful that, with the continued radical diligence of committed activists, there will be a collective community transformation centered in the truth that #BlackLivesMatter must include those lives that fall outside the margins of heteronormative safety and acceptance.\n\n\n\nLiving in my truth as a black queer person comes with the understanding that I may also be quickening my death. For that, I know that submitting to the conditions of white supremacy is not an option, and that it\u2019s worth the fight to heal my own community\u2019s conditioning in an attempt at collective freedom.

Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet, she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["invented", "sister", "rock", "woman", "queer", "music", "rosetta", "little", "recorded", "gospel", "black", "n", "tharpe", "roll"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

Burrell\u2019s tirade\u2014which featured vulgar remarks about gay and lesbian sex and a warning that they would \u201cdie in 2017\u201d\u2014led Ellen DeGeneres to cancel the scheduled talk show performance of the gospel singer\u2019s song from the Hidden Figures soundtrack. The film\u2019s stars and creative geniuses, including Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Pharrell and Octavia Spencer, all rejected the sermon\u2019s message.\n\nAmid the controversy, however, there\u2019s one group of people who haven\u2019t been getting the shine they deserve. Black LGBT ministers have long been leading the way and continuing to blaze trails for congregations that affirm and welcome LGBT people, as well as teachings that approach gender and sexuality head-on. And they\u2019ve all been outspoken in responding to Burrell\u2019s notion, as she shared in a nonapology Facebook video, that her remarks had less to do with \u201cL-G-B-T\u201d and more to do with \u201cS-I-N.\u201d\n\nThe Root spoke with seven black LGBT ministers, pastors and Christian theologians from around the country who make it unequivocally clear that antagonism against LGBT people has no place in the church. It\u2019s an issue that is resurrected every few years after a prominent black Christian expresses abject homophobia\u2014which is perhaps why some ministers weren\u2019t at all shocked by Burrell\u2019s sermon and Shirley Caesar\u2019s defense of it.\n\n\u201cBecause of her stardom and her place in gospel music, a lot of gay people look up to her. [Her sermon] was saddening, but not surprising,\u201d said Jamie Frazier, senior pastor of the Lighthouse Church of Chicago. \u201cThe crassness of her language as someone who's a pastor shows she wasn\u2019t handling this thing sensitively, and I think it was meant to curry laughter and increase her credibility \u2026 not about genuine care for people\u2019s souls.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Broderick Greer, a curate at Grace-St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church in Memphis, Tenn., agreed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to bully people from a pedestal than it is to look someone in the eyes and tell someone they\u2019re perverted. I wonder how the tone would\u2019ve changed if Pastor Burrell would\u2019ve invited a panel of LGBT Christians, specifically black LGBT Christians, to ask them about their experiences of Christianity,\u201d Greer said. \u201cOne of the great challenges of public ministry is remembering that it\u2019s important to be in conversation with people and not preach at people.\u201d\n\nBut as it relates to Burrell\u2019s position, these experts also note that her beliefs, expressed with the tone and force of a demagogue, reflect a subjective approach to Scripture\u2014one in which they rummage through the pages to confirm their own biases or preconceived notions about other people.\n\nIt\u2019s what Bishop Yvette Flunder, a leading same-gender-loving theologian and senior pastor of Oakland, Calif.\u2019s City of Refuge United Church of Christ, calls \u201cproof texting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the progeny of slaves, but the Bible also says \u2018Slaves obey your masters.\u2019 Masters read from that text to African slaves and they felt justified to be slaveholders. But black people read past that and came up with songs like, \u2018Before I be a slave, I\u2019ll be buried in my grave and go home to my Lord and be free,\u2019\u201d Flunder noted. \u201cThe Scripture didn\u2019t free us from slavery, but it was the knowledge of a God who loves us so much to not want us in that wanton institution. A lot of oppressed people are oppressing other people from the pulpit. Free people free people. So we need to work on getting free so that we can be agents of freedom.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even more puzzling, according to the Rev. DeWayne Davis, pastor of All God\u2019s Children Metropolitan Community Church in St. Paul, Minn., is that women like Burrell and Caesar cite Scripture to condemn LGBT people while somehow overlooking what the text says about women leading in churches. Davis noted a passage from the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians in particular, in which he tells women to be silent and submissive in matters of the church.\n\n\u201cThis [passage] can be grounded in a history and context removed from our own, yet it\u2019s been the basis to deny women from ordination\u2014and Caesar and Burrell are on the receiving end of that kind of discrimination in Apostolic and Pentecostal circles,\u201d Davis said. \u201c[Caesar and Burrell] may not know they\u2019re using the tools of a patriarchal theology, but they\u2019re using that same structure to [oppress] queer people \u2026 we have now arrived at a more modern interpretation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, because of male domination and relics of racism in church communities, the ministers noted, not everyone feels fully free in their congregations. Many black LGBT people, then, are caught in between a rock and a hard place. On the whole, they\u2019re attending black churches that may celebrate their racial identity but condemn their LGBT identity. And in some predominantly white and LGBT-affirming congregations, their gender and sexuality may be welcome, but their blackness may be misunderstood or pushed away.\n\nThe Rev. Marcus Halley lived the experience firsthand. After his first year of seminary, the home church he grew up in removed him from leadership because he expressed a pro-LGBT point of view in a ministry meeting\u2014well before he ever came out or realized that he was gay. But the path quickly led him to a congregation where the pastor cared for his whole personhood and encouraged him to live in his truth. He\u2019s now the pastor for young people and families at St. Andrews Episcopal Church in Kansas City, Mo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we, as spiritual leaders, affirm people in a society where so many people are searching for meaning. It\u2019s upon us to help people along that process,\u201d Halley said. \u201cIn my experience with the sexuality piece, when pastors withhold that affirmation from you, you\u2019re left to find meaning elsewhere \u2026 so people live in denial and compartmentalize it for years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of doctoral research at the Chicago Theological Seminary, Baptist Minister Theresa Smallwood focuses on a \u201cleprosy effect\u201d in the treatment of black LGBT people in Christian spaces. Smallwood approaches the topic from a Christological perspective\u2014that is, one that examines salvation from sin as inherent and gracefully conveyed because of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection. In other words, the \u201cS-I-N\u201d Burrell alleges, regardless of whether it actually is (Smallwood disagrees), has already been bound up in God\u2019s forgiveness.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t see the blood of Jesus covering every soul, it becomes a misnomer in theology. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s fallacious and poor,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cIn Jeremiah, there\u2019s a warning for people to watch what they say in God\u2019s name: It says when you scatter my flock, there will be hell to pay.\u201d\n\nShe and others, including Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Minister Candace Simpson, a third-year student at the Union Theological Seminary, believe that the rhetoric from the likes of Caesar and Burrell indeed pushes people away from the church. LGBT people, as part of the broader community, deserve love, support and a seat at the welcome table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd quite simply, it\u2019s a matter of asking the question: Is what I\u2019m preaching and believing the actual Gospel? And will [I use] the Gospel to bring death or bring life? And to whom?\u201d Simpson said. \u201cOne thing I remember hearing people say way before me is that not everything in the Bible is moral, and it\u2019s up to us and how we discern.\u201d", "keywords": ["kim", "burrell", "women", "church", "speak", "ministers", "shirley", "lgbt", "burrells", "free", "caesar", "black", "theyre", "smallwood", "pastor"], "polarity": 0.1107155896312523, "subjectivity": 0.48392139988525534},

We\u2019re talking about the powerful women of the Dora Milaje and the scene-stealing M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), and we even got a new handshake to share with our folk.\n\nGIF\n\nBut as excitement reached its peak after our first look, or looks, at the blockbuster, so have cries of #TeamTChalla\u2014better known as Black Panther\u2014vs. #TeamKillmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But as hell-bent as Killmonger seems to be on black liberation, support for anti-hero/villain Killmonger (Wakandan name: N\u2019Jadaka) may be misplaced, because it clearly comes with a side of toxic masculinity.\n\nDuring my first\u2014and second\u2014viewing of the film, I was undeniably moved by Killmonger. He spoke with the pained voice of black America, a voice that\u2019s been disconnected from its African roots and stifled and silenced by centuries of oppression. One of his first lines in the film is to ask the white female curator of an African art exhibit: \u201cHow do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price for it? Or did they take them, like they took everything else?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my theater, a cheer rose from the audience of mostly black folk. When he later pointed out that Wakanda has just been chilling on the sidelines while billions of black folk around the world were suffering, I heard more than a few folks say, \u201cYasss\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He definitely had a point: Black liberation has always been a debate between tactical resistance and revolution by any means necessary. So it\u2019s not surprising that as more and more think pieces emerge, many are split between #TeamKillmonger and #TeamTChalla.\n\nBut after viewing the movie a second time, I noticed Killmonger\u2019s hella problematic approach to liberation (shoutout to Oakland, Calif.). In a movie that otherwise unabashedly celebrates black women, his actions express a deep misogynoir that begins with the killing of his nameless girlfriend and extends through his scoffing at his aunt, the regal Ramonda (Angela Bassett); choking a female elder/shaman; murdering one of the Dora Milaje; injuring Nakia; and nearly killing Shuri.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillmonger repeatedly expresses his desire to demolish white European supremacy in favor of a black empire. His analysis of the European oppressors who stole, raped and pillaged their way across the world is not inaccurate. Black people all over the world (except the fictional Wakanda) have had their asses kicked by colonialism. But even with expansive technology and wealth at his fingertips, the only way Killmonger can think to correct this is by mimicking the behavior of the colonizer. He is not merely desiring justice but is lusting for revenge. He\u2019s not on a mission for liberation; he wants annihilation. His brutality is the very embodiment of toxic masculinity.\n\nIn a movie where no character uttered the n-word and black womanhood was centered, Killmonger\u2019s violence toward women\u2014black women in particular\u2014was stark and pronounced. Is this what we think of black American men? With a black American man helming the movie, it would be troubling to think that Killmonger could be read as unilaterally representative of black American male consciousness.\n\nErik Stevens, later Killmonger, is a black male character raised in America\u2014in Oakland, to be precise, the birthplace of the actual Black Panthers. He is a fictional black child whose mother we never see on-screen, who then grows into a black man who has seen violence both personal (the murder of his father) and political (the Rodney King verdict and the Los Angeles riots).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens has presumably watched and taken notes on the political realities of America; two years after his father\u2019s death, President Bill Clinton would sign the 1994 crime bill that exponentially increased the black prison population. He escapes that fate by attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joining the CIA and becoming a political mercenary. He is a product of his upbringing, and his rage is justified.\n\nBut Black Panther presents another path to global black freedom for its audience to consider. Instead of #TeamTChalla or #TeamKillmonger, why aren\u2019t we #TeamNakia?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom almost her first appearance in Black Panther, the character of Nakia told T\u2019Challa about himself and Wakanda, that their country couldn\u2019t idly sit back and watch the world annihilate blackness. She, embracing an arguably more Afrofuturist mindset, wanted restorative justice and liberation for black people across the world\u2014not with guns but with the blessing of Wakandan aid\u2014through their expansive technology and wealth. While it\u2019s true that sometimes revolution requires that we be armed, Nakia\u2019s point of view argued that we cannot rely solely on military might to accomplish our collective goals.\n\nComparing Nakia\u2019s and Erik\u2019s visions for liberation invites us to examine our values when it comes to revolution. And while I don\u2019t agree with everything in TaLynn Kel\u2019s article \u201cAn American Monster in Wakanda,\u201d she does have a point about the complicity of everyone but the character of Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o):\n\n\n\n\ufeffNakia knew it wasn\u2019t enough, which was why she could not stay. Would not stay and in the end, should not stay. Wakanda was complicit in the genocide of millions while looking at those suffering not with compassion, but with dismissal. Wakanda Forever really meant Wakanda first and only. Ignoring genocide doesn\u2019t exempt you from responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two visions of how we get free also ask us to take a look at our views about gender and masculinity\u2014and how our own silence often equals violence. As 45 percent of ticket buyers during Black Panther\u2019s opening weekend were women, there is also a call for us to bear witness to the ways in which we\u2014especially as black women\u2014are complicit in toxic masculinity in our social movements.\n\nIn a poignant moment after they both believe that T\u2019Challa has been murdered, his general, Okoye (Danai Gurira), and Nakia confront each other. Okoye pledges to serve the throne unconditionally, while Nakia wants to save the country (and black people), but not in service to Killmonger. It\u2019s reminiscent of the ways in which some black women will unconditionally support and protect black men who are obviously dangerous to our communities (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, etc.) in favor of protecting the idea of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut liberation cannot come on the backs of black women. We have to resist glorifying the character in the story that represents a problematic bag of liberation goals. It is not enough to claim a desire to free black folk, all while murdering, assaulting and disposing of black women. It is not enough to fight for justice while undergirding it with vengeance. Liberation must be for all.\n\nI need to be clear: I love Black Panther for so many reasons, including the way that it\u2019s pushing us to have some much-needed conversations. So much of the film resonated with me, even Killmonger\u2019s poignant last words: \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. Because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d Those words burned me to my soul.\n\nAs a character, Killmonger reminded me of the oft-quoted James Baldwin: \u201cTo be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of rage.\u201d But I also know that when rage is directed solely into vengeance and not justice\u2014at the expense of black women and in the form of blind violence against them\u2014then who are we, if not mirroring our oppressors?", "keywords": ["liberation", "wakanda", "world", "character", "women", "teamkillmonger", "nakia", "hero", "worship", "teamtoxicmasculinity", "violence", "black", "killmonger", "think", "trouble"], "polarity": 0.01912185610532719, "subjectivity": 0.40012611355586547},

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["heard", "music", "moments", "women", "song", "history", "introduced", "simones", "black", "nina", "mississippi", "perfect", "simone", "released"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, in his native Baltimore.\n\n\n\nGeraldine Moriba, executive producer of the documentary, said that one thing that surprised her about Lewis was how so many people who didn\u2019t know him credit him with being a stark influence on their lives.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve never met him and have no direct connection to him or any of his businesses have said to me they would not have gone into business or finance or banking if they had not heard his story,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I heard that again and again and again.\u201d\n\n\n\nLewis is what we now call a \u201cserial entrepreneur\u201d who started his first business at the age of 10 (a newspaper business where he had other children working for him, AND which he sold at a profit some years later). After attending the prestigious Dunbar High School in Baltimore, where he was a star quarterback, he went on to attend an HBCU, Virginia State University, on a football scholarship.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his senior year, Lewis attended a summer program at Harvard Law funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and excelled to such an extent that at the end of the program, he was invited to attend the law school, the only person in the school\u2019s 148-year history to be admitted before applying. Within two years of graduation, he started his own law firm, focusing on corporate law, and, according to a biography on the Lewis Museum\u2019s website, \u201chelped many minority-owned businesses secure badly needed capital using Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies (venture capital firms formed by corporations or foundations, operating under the aegis of the Small Business Administration).\u201d\n\n\n\nLoida Lewis, Reginald\u2019s widow and an incredible businessperson in her own right (she took over his business a year after his death and turned it around within one year), says that this was the right time for his story to be told. \u201cIt\u2019s been many years, so anyone under 40 would not have heard of Mr. Lewis. They should know that an African American man accomplished so much. Always pushing the envelope,\u201d Loida says.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis legacy, he said it himself, was \u2018Keep going no matter what,\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cNot that he didn\u2019t have any failures; he had many failures. But he kept going.\u201d She says that after her husband left Harvard Law and joined a prestigious law firm, they told him after two years that he wasn\u2019t going to make partner. But he didn\u2019t let that stop him. He founded his own law firm and went on to make history with the deals he made, though she noted that he failed three times before his first big one\u2014but that he learned from each of those failures.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReginald Lewis\u2019 first successful deal was a $22.5 million leveraged buyout of the McCall Pattern Co., which he nursed back to health and led to the two most profitable years in the company\u2019s 113-year history. In the summer of 1987, Lewis sold McCall, making a $50 million profit.\n\n\n\nNext up was the deal that made him famous. The museum explains:\n\n\n\nIn October 1987, Reginald purchased the international division of Beatrice Foods, with holdings in 31 countries, which became known as TLC Beatrice International. At $985 million, the deal was the largest leveraged buyout at the time of overseas assets by an American company. As Chairman and CEO, he moved quickly to reposition the company, pay down the debt, and vastly increase the company\u2019s worth. By 1992, the company had sales of over $1.6 billion annually, and Reginald was sharing his time between his company\u2019s offices in New York and an office in Paris (most of the company\u2019s businesses were in Europe).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoida Lewis, who describes her late husband as \u201cvery dynamic, very intesnse, very driven, very ambitious and very hardworking,\u201d also noted that as a husband and father (they had two children together: Leslie and Christina), he was \u201cvery loving, very tender, very sensitive.\u201d She admitted that he had a legendary temper but that he always made amends if he offended.\n\n\n\nThese days, Loida spends time with her grandchildren in her lovely home on New York City\u2019s Upper East Side, which is filled with glorious art, including Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence and a Picasso, and brags about her two daughters, both of whom also went to Harvard. The oldest, Leslie Lewis, is an actor who created a play called A Miracle in Rwanda, about a woman saved from the massacre in Rwanda. Her youngest, Christina Lewis Halpern, created a nonprofit, All Star Code, that trains black and brown boys to code during the summer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo in their own way, they\u2019re continuing Mr. Lewis\u2019 legacy,\u201d says Loida, who notes that Reginald was also a great philanthropist.\n\n\n\nThe Reginald F. Lewis Foundation, founded the same year he made the TLC Beatrice deal, gave an unsolicited $1 million to Howard University. In 1992, Reginald donated $3 million to Harvard Law School\u2014the largest grant in the history of the school at the time. In gratitude, the school renamed its International Law Center the Reginald F. Lewis International Law Center.\n\nFor Moriba, Reginald Lewis\u2019 legacy was making what seemed impossible into reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think his legacy is that he opened doors and he created hope where it didn\u2019t necessarily exist,\u201d Moriba says. \u201cHe became a model of how to be successful and made it real. That\u2019s his legacy.\u201d\n\nThe film will air on the New York City tristate region\u2019s local PBS stations and premieres Friday, Feb. 16, at 8 p.m. on WLIW 21; Sunday, Feb. 18, at 7:30 p.m. on WNET 13; and Saturday, Feb. 24, at 7 p.m. on NJTV.

For this collection, Jean-Raymond collaborated with both Reebok and \u201990s hip-hop brand Cross Colours, leveraging big-brand distribution and recognition for the heavy financial lifting required to bring a fully realized collection to market\u2014and as a vehicle for some seriously good clothes.\n\nThese are clothes that don\u2019t need nostalgia to usher them forward, but instead are forward-thinking in using both patriotism and the Western theme that\u2019s become a dominant trend this New York Fashion Week as a flashpoint for conversation about the current political landscape and how African Americans continue to define the history of this country.\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images 1 / 22\n\nDown the runway came loose button-down shirts paired with stovepipe leather trousers, top-stitched patchwork suits (in a nod to both denim and quilting bees) and elegant, crystal-pleated pants that elevated baggy trousers to a whole new level. Louche and easy-shearling jackets looked perfect over satin slip dresses\u2014and don\u2019t sleep on the block-pleat finish at the hem, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for any designer to make Western wear feel new; generally, it\u2019s either rehash or a costume. For Pyer Moss, designer Jean-Raymond did well to channel Wild Bill Pickett, the early-20th-century black cowboy who invented bulldogging\u2014where rodeo riders literally take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground. That, coupled with the use of a blown-up Stars and Stripes motif on blanket-sized scarves and then again in furry coat linings, seemed both a subversive statement and also a declaration of love for America and all that our country has the potential to be.\n\nSince the label\u2019s inception, Pyer Moss has composed clothes like hip-hop songs\u2014sampling beloved nostalgic influences like Cross Colours\u2014with whom designer Jean-Raymond confirmed to Vogue that a full collection is on the way. Until then, we can swoon over his current collection\u2019s mix of floor-length fun furs over hoodies and joggers for the weekend, and, for the office, patchwork jackets over tuck-pleated, high-waisted pants that give the illusion of chaps.

Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

The entire indictment focused on how the charged parties used social media to organize pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton rallies and took on fake social media profiles, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nMuch of this was designed to spark racial strife between white people and minority groups in an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. The black guys on YouTube dissing Hillary Clinton and the notorious GOP Tennessee Twitter account, among many more of their kind, have been well covered. Still, there is no evidence that any of these efforts swayed people to vote one way or the other.\n\nBuzzFeed asked experts if they believed Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was responsible for decreased black turnout in 2016, and none of them could say that was the case. Chryl Laird, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, said turnout was lower in 2016 than in 2012 because black voters simply weren\u2019t as excited about Clinton as they had been about Barack Obama. Instead, 2016 turnout should be compared to that of 2004, when it was more than 60 percent. \u201cObama would be considered a statistical outlier,\u201d Laird told BuzzFeed.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how Twitter bots discouraged black folks, least of all black women, from casting a ballot. Black voter turnout in presidential years has been on the uptick since the the mid-1990s. Of course, Obama was a once-in-a-lifetime president, and therefore, the black turnout would reflect that. In 2012, 66.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots, according to the Pew Research Center. That number dipped to 59.6 percent in 2016. That\u2019s just slightly below the 61.4 percent for overall voters that year.\n\nEvery available study finds that black men and women overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. Not sure Russian trolls had much impact. Now, voter suppression is another story. Then, there is also this thing about older black folks having to risk their lives to vote and passing that tradition down to their children. If Jim Crow could not stop black folk from voting, I doubt a Twitter troll would have more impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I also doubt that Twitter bots made Trump supporters more racist. I am sure the Republicans who believed Obama was a Muslim back in 2015 didn\u2019t need a bot to fuel their hate even more in 2016.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m suspicious of any article that argues Russian bots discouraged black voter turnout or encouraged white folks to be even more racist than they already are. Trump won because many white Americans wanted to maintain white supremacy.\n\nThank all of the Beckys\u2014aka the 53 percenters\u2014for that, not some unknown Twitter bot in Moscow.", "keywords": ["stop", "russian", "obama", "clinton", "racism", "turnout", "voters", "white", "twitter", "2016", "bots", "black", "trump", "peoples", "blaming"], "polarity": 0.05121882086167799, "subjectivity": 0.4058673469387756},

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["heard", "music", "moments", "women", "song", "history", "introduced", "simones", "black", "nina", "mississippi", "perfect", "simone", "released"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

That they get to walk around in normal society hiding in plain sight is the scary part. Most people of color would rather see a Nazi in full regalia waving a Confederate flag than a police officer with hate hidden in the cavity behind their badge because that is how institutional racism is the real killer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are four stories that shed light on how institutional bias is embedded in the fabric of America, manifesting itself in unseen ways every day:\n\n1. John Kelly calls immigrants \u201ctoo lazy to get off their asses.\u201d\n\nWhen White House chief of staff John Kelly said on Tuesday that the reason for the low number of people who registered for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was \u201cthe people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses,\u201d media outlets immediately pointed out that his statement was kind of racist in the same way that fire is kind of warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2017, after Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), a black woman, called out President Donald Trump on his racist treatment of a war veteran\u2019s wife, Kelly defended his boss by creating a story out of thin air accusing Wilson, a black woman, of basically being too uppity, referring to her as an \u201cempty barrel.\u201d A few days later, Kelly said in an interview that he believed Robert E. Lee, who led a war against his own country to preserve the institution of slavery, was an \u201chonorable man.\u201d Some would say that Kelly fit the description of a Klansman who finally decided to remove his hood.\n\nBut here is the thing that no one seems to mention: John Kelly is a longtime, decorated general in the U.S. Marine Corps. Even though his racism is surfacing only recently, it is unlikely that Kelly cultivated his racist beliefs after signing on as the chief of staff for President Trumpty Dumpty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his entire professional life, Kelly has been in charge of the careers and lives of thousands of black and brown members of the military. While we know that the only thing wypipo love more than dogs and guitar-based music is \u201cthe troops,\u201d it is impossible to now believe that a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind like a Lynyrd Skynyrd song treated his underlings fairly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying John Kelly definitely took every opportunity to discriminate against the soldiers he was in charge of; I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s what a real racist would do, and Kelly has proved that he is a real racist.\n\n2. The \u201calt-right\u201d is killing people.\n\nWhen the forward-thinking Richard Spencer decided to rebrand white supremacy as the \u201calternative right,\u201d it was a brilliant move. The new name distanced its adherents from the sordid, violent past of their predecessors in an effort to cast themselves as part of a political movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they are still doing the same thing.\n\nA new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center finds that the alt-right is responsible for more than 100 killings or injuries since 2014, including 60 deaths or injuries in 2017 alone. SPLC determined that most of the perpetrators of this violence were young (average age 25) white males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow are these incidents related to institutional racism?\n\nWell, would you call the Federal Bureau of Investigation an \u201cinstitution\u201d? Because it issued a warning to law enforcement agencies around the country against the rise of \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t have a similar designation for white groups.\n\nInstitutions like the Department of Homeland Security issue reports about foreign-born terrorists, but the white boys who kill more people get a pass. The executive branch of the U.S. government is an institution whose powers are enshrined in the Constitution. That\u2019s why they can pre-emptively call for a travel ban from Muslim countries instead of slapping a ban on Confederate flags and white boys who wear trench coats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut those black identity extremists, though.\n\n3. A neo-Nazi turns out to be a fake war veteran.\n\nThe New York Times seems to find Nazis fascinating. It recently did a story on Elliott Kline, a rising figure in the white supremacy movement. The story was about how Kline had convinced so many alt-right followers that he was a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was a sniper who killed \u201cscores of dirty Arabs\u201d (not my words).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that Kline was ... well ... just a regular old original-recipe white boy who had never been deployed during his stint in the National Guard (I told y\u2019all that wypipo love \u201cthe troops\u201d\u2014even Elliott knows). But hidden in the story, glossed over by every outlet that reported the news, was an interesting fact:\n\nKline\u2019s day job was as a \u201chuman resources administrator.\u201d The position is described by Payscale as:\n\nThe first point of contact within a company for all HR-related inquiries. Specific tasks include handling employment contracts, recruiting, and setting up interviews for open positions in the company. Additionally, HR administrators oversee other HR personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nazi. The fake thug.\n\nWhen you read reports like this one from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which shows that job applicants with white-sounding names need to send 10 job applications to get a callback, while those with black-sounding names have to send 15 on average to get a response, this is how that happens. The Economic Policy Institute will tell you that blacks are paid less than whites at every level of education, but no one knows exactly why.\n\nAfrican Americans are paid less than whites at every education level While the economy continues to improve and wages are finally beginning to inch up for most\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk Elliott Kline.\n\n4. Republicans are trying to stop the white genocide.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of the white-genocide theory (no, that is not wishing you could go back in time and make the Kardashians disappear\u2014that\u2019s \u201cJenner-cide\u201d). White genocide is the kooky, white supremacist conspiracy theory that because of diversity efforts, immigration and the potency of black sperm, whites will soon be extinct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, black people say absurd things, too. We talk with too much hyperbole. We all know Republicans can be \u201csemiracist\u201d (\u201csemi\u201d comes from the Latin word that means \u201cas a motherfucker,\u201d right?). But when we call their immigration efforts an \u201cethnic cleansing plan\u201d and say it is the Trump administration\u2019s effort to maintain white people\u2019s precipitous grip on their population majority, perhaps we are going too far. There\u2019s no evidence of that.\n\nWell, actually ...\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump\u2019s immigration plan would delay the date that white people become the minority in the country by as many as five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years the Census Bureau has been saying that people of color will outnumber non-Hispanic whites by 2044. But according to the Post\u2019s analysis, Trump\u2019s proposal could push the date back to as far as 2049.\n\nCouple that with Paul Ryan\u2019s statement Tuesday, which echoes the sentiments of the white genocide theory. When discussing entitlement reform, the fully grown Eddie Munster said, \u201cPeople ... I did my part, but we need to have higher birth rates in this country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite their ridiculous hairstyle choices, these men aren\u2019t fringe kooks in some dark corner of the internet talking shit. These are two of the most powerful men in the world. They not only create and pass legislation\u2014Ryan and Trump can also prevent any bill from becoming law.\n\nThese stories show the difference between racism and white supremacy. While it might be salacious to talk about hate rallies, Confederate statues or white women screaming the n-word in Starbucks, the real-world application of institutional racism is far more insidious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are people who laugh at the discussion of white supremacy like they laugh at people who believe in ghosts. They think we are paranoid. They say we believe it exists even when there is nothing there. But racism is a monster with gnashing teeth lurking in the shadows, harmless and invisible to those who are immune.\n\nOh, what a privilege it must be to have never seen the ghost.", "keywords": ["whites", "institutional", "real", "racism", "white", "say", "black", "works", "kelly", "racist", "john", "roundup", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.031041552344369255, "subjectivity": 0.4264844896887151},

The entire indictment focused on how the charged parties used social media to organize pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton rallies and took on fake social media profiles, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nMuch of this was designed to spark racial strife between white people and minority groups in an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump. The black guys on YouTube dissing Hillary Clinton and the notorious GOP Tennessee Twitter account, among many more of their kind, have been well covered. Still, there is no evidence that any of these efforts swayed people to vote one way or the other.\n\nBuzzFeed asked experts if they believed Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was responsible for decreased black turnout in 2016, and none of them could say that was the case. Chryl Laird, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, said turnout was lower in 2016 than in 2012 because black voters simply weren\u2019t as excited about Clinton as they had been about Barack Obama. Instead, 2016 turnout should be compared to that of 2004, when it was more than 60 percent. \u201cObama would be considered a statistical outlier,\u201d Laird told BuzzFeed.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how Twitter bots discouraged black folks, least of all black women, from casting a ballot. Black voter turnout in presidential years has been on the uptick since the the mid-1990s. Of course, Obama was a once-in-a-lifetime president, and therefore, the black turnout would reflect that. In 2012, 66.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots, according to the Pew Research Center. That number dipped to 59.6 percent in 2016. That\u2019s just slightly below the 61.4 percent for overall voters that year.\n\nEvery available study finds that black men and women overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. Not sure Russian trolls had much impact. Now, voter suppression is another story. Then, there is also this thing about older black folks having to risk their lives to vote and passing that tradition down to their children. If Jim Crow could not stop black folk from voting, I doubt a Twitter troll would have more impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I also doubt that Twitter bots made Trump supporters more racist. I am sure the Republicans who believed Obama was a Muslim back in 2015 didn\u2019t need a bot to fuel their hate even more in 2016.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m suspicious of any article that argues Russian bots discouraged black voter turnout or encouraged white folks to be even more racist than they already are. Trump won because many white Americans wanted to maintain white supremacy.\n\nThank all of the Beckys\u2014aka the 53 percenters\u2014for that, not some unknown Twitter bot in Moscow.", "keywords": ["stop", "russian", "obama", "clinton", "racism", "turnout", "voters", "white", "twitter", "2016", "bots", "black", "trump", "peoples", "blaming"], "polarity": 0.05121882086167799, "subjectivity": 0.4058673469387756},

I thought we might talk about Black History Month this time.\n\n\n\nSure! I always enjoy our talks.\n\nIn 1915, black Harvard historian Carter G. Woodson founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History with minister Jesse Moorland. So ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHold up, man, I\u2019m black! I know all that stuff. What I wanted to discuss is why some white people get so angry about it.\n\nBecause haters gonna hate, players gonna play and white people are gonna white.\n\nOK, looks like we\u2019re done here. Have a good day.\n\nThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s the reason?\n\nWhat else do you want me to tell you? I would take more time out of my busy schedule of white genocide, oppressing Caucasians and practicing reverse racism to explain it, but it\u2019s just that simple. It\u2019s like the Geico commercial. Questioning anything that they perceive as too black: It\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get it. But I often hear them say that there is no need for Black History Month or that slavery was 150 years ago and Jim Crow was ended generations ago. Shouldn\u2019t we be over it by now?\n\nThat\u2019s a great question. I know I\u2019m not supposed to answer a question with a question, but let me ask you a question: Let\u2019s say I broke both of your legs right now. When you went to the doctor and he put you in a cast, would you be over it by this afternoon?\n\nWhy you gotta be so aggressive, bruh? Of course I wouldn\u2019t be over it! But that\u2019s different.\n\nWhy? You\u2019d eventually heal. Sure, you\u2019d probably be incapacitated and in pain for a long time, but you\u2019d eventually learn how to walk again. Even if your legs were never as strong as they once were, according to your wypipo theory, you shouldn\u2019t feel any residual resentment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get what you\u2019re saying, but Jim Crow and slavery were both so long ago. Everyone knows about it, right?\n\nNot really.\n\nTo illustrate your point, a recent study by the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed that only 8 percent of high school seniors knew that slavery was the cause of the Civil War, and only 12 percent understood that slavery was not just a Southern institution. More than two-thirds didn\u2019t even know that a constitutional amendment was what ended the practice of slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeaching Hard History Schools are not adequately teaching the history of American slavery, educators are not sufficiently \u2026 Read more Read\n\nOK. But that still doesn\u2019t explain why it\u2019s important.\n\nIt\u2019s important because it is impossible to know how this country works presently without understanding the details of slavery, the legacy of black achievements and how black people were treated throughout the history of America. It\u2019s like trying to understand law without learning about previous cases. It is extremely relevant to understanding every other facet of American culture, including economics, politics, science and art.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome on, fam. How do slavery and Jim Crow play a part in 21st-century economics?\n\nIf you ever wonder why black families have only 6 percent of the generational wealth that white families have, it\u2019s partly because of Jim Crow. The two biggest drivers of economic mobility are education and homeownership.\n\nBecause of segregation and the government practice of redlining, black people were relegated to homeownership in certain areas for most of the history of this country. This not only decreased the value of black homes (if blacks were even able to own a home at all) but also increased the property values of housing in exclusively white areas. So black families have always been less likely to own or pass down their biggest asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSegregation also explains why black neighborhoods receive less funding. Because many universities didn\u2019t integrate until the \u201960s, black students didn\u2019t have the same opportunities for a college education. This is how Jim Crow is still responsible for economic inequality, and knowing that these things were embedded in the Constitution is important.\n\nOK, but politics and science? Why is black history important in those areas?\n\nBecause you can\u2019t understand two-party politics without understanding the Southern strategy and white supremacy. The difference between the Democratic and Republican parties is essentially how they differed on slavery and how they later disagreed on civil rights. Have you ever wondered why the electoral map looks a lot like the map of the Confederacy in 1864?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTry becoming a doctor without understanding how Charles Drew pioneered the methods of blood transfusions and storing blood plasma. Cancer researchers still use Henrietta Lacks\u2019 cells for research. Scientists couldn\u2019t treat arthritis or synthesize steroids, estrogen and testosterone until Percy Julian figured it out. America was able to put a man in space only after Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory.\n\nNone of this is black history. It\u2019s American history.\n\nTrue. But American art?\n\nThere is no such thing.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\u201cAmerica\u201d has never created an art form. Black people did.\n\nJazz was created by black people. The blues were created by black people. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was created by black people. Hip-hop was created by black people. Every form of American dance is an iteration of black dance. Graffiti is the only visual art form that was created in America. Vaudeville was just people singing and performing in blackface until Moms Mabley discovered she could just stand there and tell jokes, becoming the first pure American stand-up comedian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so that\u2019s why black history is important. Because black people made America great the first time!\n\nYes. America is an economic superpower because of the free labor of slaves. America is a military superpower because of the black soldiers who tipped the scales in this country\u2019s favor in every war. American art and culture are the most popular in the world because of the music, poetry and art that black people created.\n\nThere is nothing about America that can be understood if you don\u2019t know black history. It\u2019s like learning about how a car works and knowing nothing about the engine. Black people are not simply a part of this country; it belongs to us. Without it, this country would simply be Diet Europe filled with poor, sunburned wypipo waltzing off the beat to baroque music, joints sore from arthritis, eating bland chicken breast between hockey games as they looked up at the stars dreaming about how they could go there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why is it only in February?

Pence\u2019s snubbing of black people happened on the same day President Donald Trump talked as if Frederick Douglass, abolitionist, writer and civil rights leader, were still alive (he died in 1895). Later in the month, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said that HBCUs were \u201cpioneers\u201d of \u201cschool choice\u201d (colleges were segregated).\n\n\n\nIt was a sign of things to come.\n\n\n\nBy Pence\u2019s standard, Trump made black history in his first year as president by waging an assault on voting rights through his now-defunct voting-fraud commission, calling white supremacists \u201cfine people\u201d after the Charlottesville, Va., march and, more recently, disparaging Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should all be appalled at the administration\u2019s ignorance around race, but we should be not surprised. Racism is taught. And when white history is the standard, when history is told from the point of view of white people, you might well believe, as failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore does, that slavery was good for black people.\n\n\n\nThe flagrant ignorance and blatant racism of the Trump administration makes clearer what black celebrities such as Morgan Freeman and Stacey Dash mean (or so we hope) when they say, \u201cI don\u2019t want Black History Month.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that black history is needed all year long. But white history as we know it can no longer be the standard in a multicultural society, which is supposed to maximize the potential of all its members.\n\n\n\nThe late, great historian Carter G. Woodson started Negro History Week in 1926 with hopes that black people would be proud of their heritage and that mainstream America would recognize the contributions of its black residents. While millions of students across the country now study the influences of black people and culture in what has evolved into Black History Month, Trump proves regularly that Woodson\u2019s ultimate goal of integrating black history into our core curricula fell far short of national acceptance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe danger in relegating black history to a month is that it becomes horribly contained to a month. Ask your child, colleague or friend to say a few brief words about Woodson, sing the first few lines of \u201cthe black national anthem\u201d or identify five African countries during the rest of the months and there\u2019s a strong possibility that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re talking to a version of Trump.\n\nBlack contributions to society are not being recognized in the pantheon of American history. Worse, this lack of recognition is reflected in national policy, racial inequities in compensation and the discounting of black leadership. Unequal pay is a blatant, empirical sign of a devaluation of worth.\n\n\n\nYou obviously can\u2019t blame the devaluation of black people on Black History Month. As a young person, I remember learning about renowned surgeon Ben Carson at a BLM event and how he became the first to successfully separate twins at the head. I listened to Carson with admiration and pride at another such event when he narrated, with great aplomb, the exact stops along the neural pathway from a touch of the finger to the brain and back again. It\u2019s a shtick I would hear many times, with the same reaction.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Carson, as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, referred to slaves as \u201cimmigrants\u201d last year during a departmental junket with employees, he proved that there\u2019s nothing wrong with BLM. Carson, too, could not detach the white-centric history he learned in school from his own brain.\n\n\n\nNo wonder, when he probably also studied those whitewashed stories of Christopher Columbus \u201cdiscovering\u201d America (no matter the millions of Native Americans already living here), which are buttressed by tales of how the Pilgrims supposedly sat down with the Indians for a delightful supper (already part of their harvest tradition).\n\nWhen slavery is covered in history class, the teaching of black benign servitude too often goes along with ideas that the Ku Klux Klan is a Christian organization exhibiting principles like loving thy neighbor. We have statues of Confederate heroes\u2014i.e., racist traitors\u2014littered throughout the U.S., particularly in the South. And of course, Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe misrepresenting of colonization, slavery and racists is behind the racism and ignorance of Trump and people like him, not Black History Month.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m indebted to the people, places and traditions I\u2019ve been introduced to in February. I have received numerous invitations to speak at BLM events, and I will continue to highlight black accomplishments in my columns during February. Calling for mainstream inclusion isn\u2019t a charge to end BLM. In fact, we can use it to introduce more recent history and fresh faces.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if there is a book by a black author that you must read this month, take in Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, by Ibram X. Kendi, winner of the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction. Kendi\u2019s book provides a thorough reading of U.S. history from the perspective of black people. He moves Woodson\u2019s legacy forward, along with those of other notable historians who are still alive, such as James D. Anderson, Robin D.G. Kelley, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Blair L.M. Kelley and Paula Giddings. There are people who continue to write outside of white standards, to our collective benefit. But to reap the social fruits of their labor, we must remove the standard of white-centric history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting to a place where we can make history more inclusive is not easy. In fact, it\u2019s a thoroughly radical endeavor that first requires society to acknowledge that history is not an impartial narration of events as they occurred. It is, rather, the story as told by the people who are telling it. Retelling our history requires acknowledging that the American identity is rooted in a false narrative that makes the exhortation to \u201cMake America great again\u201d an oxymoron (for the people who were brought here as slaves, it was never all that great to begin with).\n\n\n\nMany multicultural-education advocates have promoted curricula that expand the perspectives in American history. The pushback to the ethnic-studies and multicultural-education movements is about protecting white history. University faculty have much more leeway as to their text selection, but people of color are severely underrepresented in the full-time teaching ranks. And core undergraduate curriculums are guarded by traditions, professional (read: white) standards and faculty who were trained in accordance with them.\n\n\n\nRemoving racist history books will be harder than shuttling Confederate monuments to the backs of museums. Neither important act is about erasing history\u2014it\u2019s about making it. Woodson wanted to see black history infused into American history because they\u2019re one and the same. But he also wanted the idolatry of whiteness removed from America\u2019s sight.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["slavery", "standard", "single", "white", "history", "national", "great", "black", "trump", "shouldnt", "racist", "cant", "relegated", "month"], "polarity": 0.04301038843721771, "subjectivity": 0.38613803766242794},

Oswalt has been arrested and was jailed that same day in lieu of $157,000 bail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Wednesday, his bail was increased to $250,000. Oswalt pleaded not guilty to all charges Thursday. If Oswalt posts bail, he will be banned from the university\u2019s campus and from having any contact with members of the Corvallis chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice. He will also have to surrender four firearms that authorities say they discovered in his home.\n\nAccording to the news site, Oswalt drew attention to himself last week after he wrote about some of his trash views in a student newspaper article, sparking outrage on the campus.\n\nIt turns out that last week was also the first time he was arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief for what authorities say was his little bumper sticker stunt last summer off campus. However, he was released the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that Oswalt and another unidentified individual put the racist bumper stickers\u2014which contained a hateful slur against black people\u2014on two cars that belonged to social activists parked outside a local food co-op.\n\nThe stickers that were placed on the cars covered messages that supported immigrants and refugees.\n\nAt the same time, an employee discovered that someone had also put anti-Semitic leaflets on the windshields of every car in the staff parking lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a hate crime inspired by ignorance, fueled by racism and aimed at people of color,\u201d Benton County Deputy District Attorney Ryan Joslin told The Oregonian. \u201cIt was his intent to terrorize both individuals and a group of people.\u201d\n\nMere days after his first arrest last week, photos of Oswalt throwing up Nazi salutes from a highway overpass, carrying a swastika flag on Holocaust Remembrance Day and marching with white nationalists at a Portland, Ore., rally last April surfaced on the website of the Pacific Northwest Anti-Fascist Workers Collective, a group made up of anti-fascist activists from Oregon and Washington state.\n\nThis is not the first time that Oswalt\u2019s white supremacist beliefs have been documented, The Oregonian notes.

But as the derivative hashtag #OscarsSoBlackAndWhite rears its ugly head once again this year, it\u2019s worth revisiting a countertradition: the anti-black resentments that bubble up from nonblack people of color who blame black people for their own communities\u2019 underrepresentation.\n\nWith high-profile nominations going to Mudbound\u2019s Mary J. Blige, The Shape of Water\u2019s Octavia Spencer, Get Out\u2019s Daniel Kaluuya and Jordan Peele, and Roman J. Israel, Esq.\u2019s Denzel Washington, conversations on Oscars diversity have now turned to the admittedly poor showing for Asian and Latinx actors this year (while the question of Native American underrepresentation continues to be sidelined).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s true\u2014this makes the sixth year in a row that no Latinx actors have been nominated for an acting Academy Award, and only 1 percent of Oscar nominations have gone to Asian actors in the past 89 (!) years. And yet the vitriol and rhetoric of #OscarsSoBlackAndWhite make clear that the hashtag is about more than addressing (nonblack) Latinx and Asian underrepresentation: it\u2019s an outlet for anti-black claims that black people are \u201chogging\u201d all the diversity.\n\n\n\nIt comes down to a pervasive and wildly ahistorical belief that black people wield privilege and power over nonblack people of color because of their (hyper)visibility in conversations about race and racism. As Shanice Brim writes, \u201cA lot of nonblack people feel that black issues take up too much space in the racism discussion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see it all the time in mainstream media\u2014from the Master of None bit in which Aziz Ansari\u2019s Dev Shah complained that \u201cpeople don\u2019t get that fired up about racist Asian or Indian stuff ... you only risk starting a brouhaha if you say something bad about black or gay people,\u201d to Salma Hayek\u2019s shutting down Jessica Williams\u2019 critique of anti-blackness in white feminism by interjecting with an account of her own experience as a (light-skinned) Latina in Hollywood.\n\nIt takes ignoring the singular, ongoing history of racial slavery and the violence of hypervisibility to pin the problems of nonblack people of color on black folks. But it happens again and again\u2014and not just in the world of Hollywood.\n\nFor years, \u201cgoing beyond black and white\u201d has been a catchphrase of nonblack Asian-American and Latinx advocates looking to spotlight their communities\u2019 unique struggles against white supremacy. But as critical race theorist Mari Matsuda has warned, anti-blackness often underlies the rhetoric of moving past the \u201cblack and white binary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatsuda explains: \u201cWhen we say we need to move beyond black and white, this is what a whole lot of people say or feel or think: \u2018Thank goodness we can get off that paradigm, because those black people made me feel so uncomfortable. ... Thank God I don\u2019t have to take those angry black people seriously anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe myth of black privilege has real consequences, fracturing interracial coalitions and making black people the scapegoat for the violence white supremacy enacts on Latinx and Asian-American folks. Behind the thousands of Chinese-American protesters who declared that killer cop Peter Liang was a \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d to Black Lives Matter is the belief that, as one protester put it, \u201cwhite people [are] first-class, black people [are] second-class. ... Chinese [are] no class, or the last class.\u201d Likewise, beneath claims that a \u201cLatino Lives Matter\u201d movement is being stifled by \u201cblack and white\u201d conceptions of race is the twisted notion that black people are somehow responsible for a black-white binary that white people created to enforce their legal status as property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why in 2016, after nonblack people of color asked why Academy Award host Chris Rock wasn\u2019t mentioning Asian-American or Latinx underrepresentation, Mikki Kendall created the brilliant and incisive hashtag #NotYourMule to critique the expectation that black people will do the work for nonblack communities of color that often don\u2019t return the favor.\n\nWhile the hashtag is new, the sentiment isn\u2019t: It\u2019s a paraphrase from Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s 1937 novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. And critiquing the demand for black activists to ally with nonblacks similarly has a long history.\n\nIn 1967, Kwame Ture and Charles V. Hamilton discredited the expectation that Black Power activists should align with \u201cgroups [that] accept the American system and want only\u2014if at all\u2014to make peripheral, marginal reforms in it.\u201d Addressing anti-blackness among nonblack people of color means confronting that same question: Do we want coalitions with black folks only until we can join white people as agents of anti-black and settler-colonial violence? Or do we seek, as Ture and Hamilton wrote, \u201cthe total revamping of society\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to build meaningful coalitions with black activists, we don\u2019t have to start from scratch: There is a long tradition of interracial solidarity movements\u2014from the Chicano and Asian-American activists who stood with Black Panther Party members to free Huey Newton, to recent Black Lives Matter solidarity efforts in which nonblack POC have shut down federal buildings, confronted their family members and fought to hold nonblack POC police officers accountable for the murder of black people.\n\nThis ongoing history of solidarity teaches us that when we come together to honestly confront our unique but intertwined experiences of oppression, we can unlearn the capitalist belief that justice is a limited resource.\n\nBut when it comes to mainstream media representation, it\u2019s easy to feel like we are fighting for scraps. Too often, that leads to nonblack POC using anti-blackness to try to steal the spotlight\u2014like when a group of Asian Americans \u201cborrowed\u201d the #OscarsSoWhite tag for a panel at SXSW without inviting, or even consulting, its creator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, though April Reign has every right to say that #OscarsSoWhite is indeed by and for black people alone, she has taken every opportunity to insist that Hollywood still needs to do better by nonblack Asian Americans and Latinx folks, declaring after last year\u2019s nominations saw an uptick in black nominees that \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\u201d#OscarsSoBlackAndWhite is just another reminder that the labor and leadership of black women too often go unappreciated.\n\nUltimately, the demand for black people to build political coalitions with nonblack people of color is a demand for unreciprocated black labor. Our work to confront Asian-American and Latinx media underrepresentation\u2014and the countless violences our communities face outside of Hollywood\u2014is cut out for us. But let\u2019s be clear: It is our work.\n\n", "keywords": ["color", "asian", "work", "hashtag", "asianamerican", "latinx", "white", "say", "black", "oscarssoblackandwhite", "myth", "nonblack", "privilege"], "polarity": -0.021220289144817425, "subjectivity": 0.4139130523564483},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

Captained by William Foster, the Clotilda unloaded its precious cargo: 110 kidnapped human beings.\n\n\n\nWhen federal authorities discovered that Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Mobile plantation owner, had made a bet with his friends that he could sneak a shipment of slaves into the country, they decided to investigate the crime. To hide their misdeeds, Foster rushed to the Clotilda and set it on fire. The vessel sank to the bottom of the ocean, never to be seen again.\n\nNow AL.com reports that one of its reporters, Ben Raines, may have discovered the last slave ship in American buried in the mud of the lower Mobile-Tensaw Delta. The ship would normally have been covered by the water, but the unusually northern winds from the recent \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d on the Eastern Seaboard reduced the tide in Mobile Bay to 2 1/2 feet below its normal depth, revealing the ship to Raines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quaking with excitement. This would be a story of world historical significance if this is the Clotilda,\u201d said John Sledge, a senior historian with the Mobile Historical Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly in the right vicinity. ... We always knew it should be right around there.\u201d Sledge is also the author of The Mobile River, an exhaustive examination of the river.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaines notes that the ship lies exactly where Foster said he burned it, but so far, state laws governing ship wreckage have prevented investigators from exploring the part of the wreckage buried in the mud. Archaeologists are trying to use historical records and personal accounts to verify the ship\u2019s identity.\n\nOne of the accounts that researchers may use is from Zora Neale Hurston, who spent three months in Alabama interviewing Cudjo Lewis in 1931. Lewis came to the country on the Clotilda and was the last survivor of the mid-Atlantic slave trade.\n\nLewis spent five years as the property of Meaher. After he was emancipated, Lewis, along with other former slaves from his ship, demanded reparations.

The reader follows Jenkins, now 25, just a few miles but a lifetime away to New York City, where she is eager to land bylines at the world\u2019s top publications.\n\nAlong the way, Jerkins takes the reader to deeply personal and, at times, uncomfortable places. She chronicles her struggles with dating and heartbreak, unflinchingly guides her reader through a personal surgical procedure and wrestles with a variety of different gazes: that of white men and white women, but also of potential lovers, of her host families and other people in Japan and Russia, of her black female peers and, most important, her own evolving view of herself.\n\nThe work-in-progress nature shows at times. Gay mentioned in a recent interview with Jerkins in Elle magazine that \u201cthere are places where I wanted [Jerkins] to push her conclusions further,\u201d and Jerkins\u2019 approach to certain topics likely won\u2019t be appreciated by everyone. Jerkins\u2019 feminism includes unbowed self-advocacy, and some readers may find fault with the way she calls out specific people and their behaviors, including some high-profile black women. For her part, Jerkins says she \u201cstands by the book and everything I wrote in it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting it all out there, she said in conversation with The Glow Up, is the whole point.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed.]\n\n\n\nOn writing about having labiaplasty\u2014and other taboo subjects:\n\n\u201cI was worried about what my mother would think, what my father would think, the church in which I was raised would think. The men whom I haven\u2019t even met, I wondered what they would think\u2014would I be unattractive to them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the book was just to lay it all out there on the table, and not with the aim that you agree with me, but that you at least have an understanding of where I\u2019m coming from. I probably look at certain chapters where I talk about dating or where I talk about my labiaplasty, and I\u2019ll look at it and I\u2019ll still feel that reverberation\u2014like, you had to go there?\u201d\n\nOn revealing the more unflattering parts of her experiences:\n\n\u201cWriting about yourself isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. Anytime you feel nervous about writing about something, I believe that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right track. ... I had to keep telling myself, \u2018Stop worrying about that invisible person and whether or not they\u2019re going to be freaked out by it or whatever. Think about the people that might read a little bit more expansively because of what you\u2019ve said. Or don\u2019t think of anybody. Write what needs to be said. What you want it to say.\u2019 That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the pain of being called \u201cintimidating\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe worst thing someone can say about me in a personal sense, because I\u2019ve heard other media outlets say this about me, is that I\u2019m intimidating. Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

Oprah undoubtedly is a legend, great orator and motivator, and billionaire, and essentially \u201cqualified\u201d to be president.\n\n\n\nNow she has gone on record to say that she doesn\u2019t plan on running for president. However, this continued desire to have another black face in the White House is something our community needs to reassess as we move closer to the midterm elections and the impending tokenization of the black vote.\n\n\n\nTo be clear: This country is not ready for, nor does it deserve, another black president.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the history. We have had one black president, and for all intents and purposes, Barack Obama did a decent job upholding the standards of the Oval Office. The problem is that these standards are oftentimes rooted in anti-blackness, and no matter the color of the person who adheres to those standards, he or she will inherently continue to hurt black and brown people, both domestic and global. Behind Obama\u2019s charismatic charm, bright smile and Al Green vocals was a man in a position of power that required him to do some very inhumane things.\n\n\n\nYet we are still eager to throw another black face into the White House because colonization has conditioned us to believe in symbolism as an ideology of progress, rather than realize that tokenism of black people within white systems has only been used as a litmus test for what is an acceptable standard of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protection of Obama\u2019s legacy by the black community has already begun, with an attempt to turn a blind eye to the wrongdoings, which is eerily similar to the reverent school lessons about America\u2019s forefathers, despite their complicity in slavery and racism. We can\u2019t allow an omission of the facts simply because Obama is black.\n\nIn addition to the good, Obama will be remembered for the thousands killed in drone strikes he ordered and the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants by any president in our history. Again, this is part of the job of running a white, imperialist nation. Yet we are still eager to throw another black face into the White House because colonization has conditioned us to believe in symbolism as an ideology of progress, rather than realize that tokenism of black people within white systems has only been used as a litmus test for what is an acceptable standard of blackness.\n\n\n\nHari Ziyad touches on this idea in his piece, \u201cWhy I Don\u2019t Want Another Black President,\u201d when he states: \u201cBut while giving black folks the fleeting empowerment of representation, Barack Obama did very little to challenge white society\u2014at least much less than he did to support it. His final acts as president, for example, will not be to pardon black freedom fighters-turned-political prisoners and fugitives like Nehanda Abiodun, but to ensure the smooth transition of power to his virulently anti-black successor.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe fail ourselves every time we place the burden of our freedom in elected officials\u2014especially those who are black and required to serve the white majority. Once in office, they continue to enforce laws that are inherently anti-black, which is in direct conflict with why many of us voted for them in the first place.\n\nOur failure is that we continue to try to work within a system that was created without the intention of ensuring equity or equality among races. Hundreds of years of evidence to the contrary, we continue to place our hopes in those like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who will eventually succumb to the pressures of the system that uses them as pawns of \u201cprogress\u201d to dehumanize those who aren\u2019t able or willing to assimilate into whiteness as they have.\n\n\n\nThe two-party system from which they operate has never served black communities well. Having the option of Democrat or Republican is often about choosing the lesser of two evils, despite the color of the person running for office. The pandering for our vote over the last 50 years has given us nothing but empty promises, mass incarceration, health care discrimination and a median family wealth that could drop to zero for African Americans in 2053.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all of this, hope is not lost for those willing to invest in politics when it really matters. That means, as black folks, we can\u2019t wait every four years to be interested in what is going on in our country. We also shouldn\u2019t be waiting every two years for the midterm elections to get involved.\n\nFirst we must begin supporting local grassroots organizations that are on the ground attempting to make changes that will have national implication, while also divesting from systems of oppression in an effort to dismantle them; we need to begin anew with systems not built on anti-blackness.\n\nBlack folks have to become more than the swing vote that decides which evil gets to run the white imperialist empire.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis country is not built for, nor does it deserve to have, a black man, woman or gender-nonconforming person as president. Nearly 400 years of history have taught us that this system will not bring about freedom.\n\nThe time is now that we demand a change, starting with ourselves and how we do politics.

At 7:39 a.m. EST, Trump, his tummy likely rumbling in anticipation of the first Diet Coke of the day, tweeted the following:\n\nLittle Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information.

That memo was put out on Friday after being declassified by the White House, in what many see as a stunt to undermine the Russia investigation.\n\nOf course, leaking classified information is a federal crime, so it\u2019s no small thing to accuse somebody, least of all the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, of doing so. But just as noteworthy: the vague call that Schiff \u201cmust be stopped,\u201d which can certainly be read as a threat against the Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff responded a little more than an hour later via Twitter, in \u201cI\u2019m not new to this, I\u2019m true to this\u201d form.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I see you\u2019ve had a busy morning of \u2018Executive Time,\u2019\u201d Schiff shaded. \u201cInstead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchiff has sure mastered the use of passive-aggressive punctuation points\u2014I see you with the \u201c\u2018Executive Time\u2019\u201d and shady little ellipses.

Schiff rebutted last week\u2019s GOP memo accusing federal law enforcement officials of abusing their power to spy on the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if this systematic, undisciplined targeting of \u201cenemies\u201d (even if the vocabulary employed to do so is limited) were some sort of warning sign for authoritarianism, like trying to intimidate the press, fearmongering, politicizing the military and selective devotion to the law.\n\nYou know, just a little bit.", "keywords": ["aint", "president", "original", "lawmaker", "democratic", "belittles", "little", "committee", "sure", "messy", "house", "trump", "memo", "intelligence", "schiff", "adam"], "polarity": 0.0019283746556473752, "subjectivity": 0.402416207529844},

You know white people only know two or three black historical figures at most. And neither the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. nor former President Barack Obama is from Boston, which leaves them with, ummm ... the other one.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s Boston, a city known for racism, tea parties and racism.

She died Friday, Jan. 12, at the age of 101.\n\nBorn in segregated Virginia in 1916, Freeman was raised in a college-educated family, ultimately attending Hampton University, where she pledged Delta Sigma Theta Sorority\u2014which celebrates its 105th Founders\u2019 Day today. She would later serve as the sorority\u2019s national president from 1967 to 1971.\n\nFreeman then enrolled in Howard University Law School, where she joined Epsilon Sigma Iota Sorority, the first American legal sorority for women of color. After she received her law degree in 1947, her attempts to join multiple law firms went ignored. Undeterred, Freeman established her own private practice, focusing on pro bono, divorce and criminal cases.\n\nThat focus turned to civil rights when Freeman became legal counsel to the NAACP in its 1949 suit against the St. Louis Board of Education. By 1954 she was lead attorney in the landmark case Davis v. the St. Louis Housing Authority, which ended legal racial discrimination in public housing within the city. Freeman also made St. Louis her home, soon becoming general counsel of the St. Louis Housing Authority.\n\nIn 1964 Freeman became the first woman to be appointed to the United States Commission on Civil Rights, a position she would hold for 13 years and four presidencies, before President Jimmy Carter appointed her inspector general for the Community Services Administration. After being forced out of this role by the Reagan administration, Freeman helped to form the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan commission of former federal officials committed to ending racial discrimination and counteracting its effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon her return to St. Louis, Freeman once again became active in local politics. In 2006 she co-led a state advisory committee that eventually led to a state takeover of the operation of the St. Louis school district. She continued to practice law into her 90s.\n\nThe Glow Up salutes Frankie Muse Freeman for her tireless fight against racial injustice, and thanks her for over 60 years of service on our behalf.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["mother", "situation", "pain", "right", "mothers", "rest", "lives", "dormeus", "theres", "wont", "hes", "gaines", "speaks", "korryn", "child", "family", "baltimore"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

It is impossible to comprehend the far-reaching effects of the all-American tradition of racism without a holistic examination.\n\n\n\nOr you can just look at what happened this week.\n\nA Trump nominee has no idea if racial bias exists in the justice system.\n\nDuring his Wednesday Senate confirmation hearings, Michael Brennan, a white lawyer who has been nominated to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, repeatedly dodged questions from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about racial bias in the justice system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo you think implicit racial bias exists in our criminal-justice system?\u201d Booker asked the Wisconsin lawyer.\n\n\u201cI would indicate only that I would do my very best as a judge to ensure that no biases came in,\u201d Brennan replied caucasianally. Booker asked him again:\n\nYou\u2019re aware that African Americans are stopped more than whites for drug searches in this country? That there\u2019s no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or dealing drugs, but [blacks] are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for it? You\u2019re aware of the data, I imagine, that says African Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimum sentences for the same crime? You\u2019re probably aware of the data that African Americans are more likely to serve more time for similar crimes ... You\u2019re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal-justice system? I find this astonishing.\n\nIf confirmed, Brennan would have a lifetime appointment to a court that has heard cases concerning sanctuary cities, voting rights, police brutality and the deportation of immigrants in this month alone. Brennan also served as a trial judge on a Milwaukee circuit court for nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study shows bias in the criminal-justice system at every level. The study collected years of data on convictions, arrests, pleas and sentencing from\u2014you guessed it\u2014Wisconsin.\n\nWhite extremists kill more cops, but the FBI tracks black groups more closely.\n\nSince 1990, white supremacists and far-right extremists have killed 50 law-enforcement officers in the U.S., according to a recent report by the Anti-Defamation League. The report notes that left-wing groups, including \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d have killed 11 officers during that period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the FBI issued an August 2017 report entitled, \u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d (pdf), warning 18,000 local and state agencies around the country of the threat posed by black groups. It has not issued an equivalent report for the far more dangerous right-wing groups, but, to be fair, the FBI doesn\u2019t have an equivalent designation for white identity extremists.\n\n\u201cThis document essentially says we don\u2019t care about your ideology, we care about your black identity,\u201d Michael German, a former FBI agent who worked in the counterterrorism division, told the Miami Herald. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous classification that could encompass any violence by a black person.\u201d\n\nAlthough the FBI says it does not monitor groups based on speech, German notes that the threshold for surveillance is so low that the agency\u2019s report can be used to justify watching black organizations and monitoring black protests more closely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorrections officers exchanged racist messages while the Sheriff\u2019s Office stayed silent.\n\nA sergeant at the Santa Clara County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Office is waiting for an arbitrator to decide whether he should have been removed from his job for not reporting racist texts and emails from corrections officers in the county jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mercury News, Don Morrissey worked at the facility and did nothing to stop a group of about eight officers and one deputy from exchanging messages that included calling Jews \u201ckikes\u201d and black people \u201cniggers\u201d and \u201cyard apes.\u201d In one text, an officer said, \u201cWe could hang a nigger in Haiti for about 75 bucks tops.\u201d Another officer texted, \u201cCops have already killed 550 people in 2015,\u201d to which another responded, \u201cIf they\u2019re black, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nThe case is significant because the officer never sent any of the racial epithets (although he joined in on the conversations), but tolerated a racist environment. Morrissey argues that many of the texts were sent while the officers were not on duty. He added that\u2014even though he knew about the texts\u2014he should not be responsible for the conduct of others, which is a valid point, except for one thing:\n\nMorrissey is president of the Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Association of Santa Clara County!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is how institutional racism works. It is not about crosses on lawns or marches in Charlottesville, Va. However despicable those things might seem, they are far less impactful than the subtle tyranny of unseen bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be black in America is to walk a minefield of white supremacy, never knowing where racism might explode and rip you apart. It is buried in at least one teacher in every school. It sits behind the benches of courtrooms across the country. It is in chambered in the guns and hearts of police officers everywhere.\n\nInstitutional racism is not a problem that can be cured with a \u201cconversation about race.\u201d It is an American contagion for which there is no cure\u2014an unseen microscopic virus that infects white people and kills black people.\n\nIt is not being called a \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nIt is the everlasting, invisible scourge of being treated like one.", "keywords": ["happened", "institutional", "officers", "racism", "week", "likely", "white", "fbi", "system", "racial", "black", "groups", "report", "know", "need"], "polarity": 0.05744444444444439, "subjectivity": 0.39675555555555553},

I have zero science to back this up; nor do I have a link to a white paper from the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems\u2019 (that was a real thing, by the way) early writings that proves this axiom dating back to the 1870s. Truth is, some shit is just true.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household. There were things I grew up with and learned that I likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten had I grown up in any other circumstance. Also, you like how I properly used the term axiom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are 10 reasons I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household.\n\n1. I grew up listening to Luther Vandross.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a world where I had to discover the greatness of Luther as an adult and then actively think about all the years I missed out on having that music in my life. As a youth, while I was living with my white mother, we listened to a veritable cornucopia of music, including black music. But in white households, that means Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix. My mother also has an affinity for Peaches & Herb\u2014\u201cReunited,\u201d to be specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once I moved to live with my pops, I got nonstop Motown, Stax, Luther, Aretha and all the great music that spoke more directly to my soul than ZZ Top and AC/DC\u2014both groups I enjoy, but it\u2019s just ... different. To be fair, my father also had a penchant for Kenny G, and Rod Stewart was never too far. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. I learned that when you see other people start running, you start running.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cGet the fuck out of Dodge\u201d procedures are taught in other cultures or if any are taught at all. I do know that somewhere along the way, the words \u201cAnd boy, if you see a group of people running, you run in the same direction and you don\u2019t stop to ask no questions or find out what\u2019s going on until you see 75 to 96 percent of everybody else stop\u201d were passed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. I grew up on a significant number of black movies.\n\nIF there was a movie with mostly black people in it, we were watching it. From The Last Dragon to The Wiz. Of course, we watched anything with Eddie Murphy\u2014as did everybody, apparently. Did you know that Coming to America did nearly $300 million in 1988?! But I know who Sho\u2019nuff is, and even though I think the movie is trash, the soundtrack to The Wiz is amazeballs.\n\n4. Seasoning, seasoning everywhere.\n\nThis is one of those stereotypical things that I\u2019ve accepted as fact even though my proof is akin to the proof white folks needed to convict black men in the \u201950s. The only time I\u2019ve eaten white cooking has largely been when I was with my white mother during the summers, and she loved her some seasoning. Other than that, I can\u2019t actually say that I spent much time in any white people\u2019s households long enough to eat their cooking. Now that I think about this, I\u2019m not sure if this is sad or God\u2019s grace. Maybe it\u2019s both. Clearly, I don\u2019t know enough white people. Or any outside of family, really. In terms of other cultures, I know they be seasoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I grew up with a healthy fear of my parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying other folks didn\u2019t, but I have children, which means I\u2019ve been to children\u2019s birthday parties and outings where other adults interacted with their children. Or even better: Last month, I had to fly to Detroit for a family situation. When I flew back to Washington, D.C., as I was walking through the TSA Precheck line (FTMFW!), a family of four was in front of me.\n\nThere was a bowl of peppermints available to folks in the line, and the mom made some remark about her maybe-12-year-old son and eating peppermints. This little white child yelled out, \u201cMom, you\u2019re SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES!\u201d Do you know the mom looked at me as if to see if anybody noticed, and I just shook my head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my black mother is a super-friendly, very nice, God-fearing woman who embarrasses easy when her very loud children (me and one of my sisters) get to the shenanigans. But do you know what I would NEVER fathom doing for fear of this woman who hasn\u2019t put a foreign object on me since fifth grade? Calling her a jerk or anything outside of her name ever\u2014but especially publicly.\n\nFor one, what if that sent her over the edge? For b, what if she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell your father\u201d? That man listens to Kenny G. He\u2019s capable of anything. That little white boy yelled this IN FRONT of both his parents AT his mother. I\u2019m just saying. I\u2019ve got fear in my heart ... of my parents. It might not be a UNIVERSAL black trait, but I got it from my black-hand side.\n\n6. Life was one big-ass black history lesson.\n\nSure, we watched fun stuff, but my parents also made us watch movies about historical atrocities committed against black people. I remember watching a documentary on the Scottsboro Boys over and over again. Black books were around, and we had a black encyclopedia set and black-Jesus-centric Bible (still do).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure in some homes, the talk about being a black man in America went something like, \u201cAight Ja\u2019Rome, get your black ass killed tonight by some cracka-ass-cracka white cop because YOU think it\u2019s a good idea to act like you ain\u2019t go\u2019 no damn sense hanging out there with DonQ\u2019uestajuan, Black and Lil Jimmy from 41st.\u201d In others, it wasn\u2019t so succinct and required a lot more subtlety and nuance.\n\nAlso, I grew up reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and staring at the book version of Roots (seriously, that shit looks like it has all the pages) but watching the movie. Just saying, are white families making their kids read about Malcolm? I\u2019m better off for it.\n\n7. I went to typical long-service black churches as a youth.\n\nI currently attend a church\u2014when I\u2019m there\u2014that lasts about an hour, hour and a half tops. I appreciate this with all of the appreciation I can muster because I grew up going to church services that could last two-and-a-half hours, easy. And don\u2019t get me started on Easter. New suits are awesome, but sitting in there for a week waiting to get to another sermon about Jesus rising was not the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to that solidly Southern, super-long black-church service has me looking at come-as-you-are, hourlong services like a smaller version of the lottery. I went to a white service once in Alabama, and aside from the music being trash (not sure we can call it that, actually), the service was so short that I thought maybe we were cheating God by leaving after only an hour. I also recognize not all nonblack churches believe in brevity.\n\n8. I learned the significance of NOT giving left-hand dap.\n\nDisrespect is the leading cause of death for black males between the age of birth and death. I\u2019ve said this for the past 20 years and I cannot be convinced this isn\u2019t true. One thing white dudes don\u2019t seem to mind doing is extending that left hand. I\u2019ve actually seen with my own two eyes a fight nearly break out because one dude refused to accept a left-handed dap and the other fellow took offense at the implication that he was being disrespectful by offering it. Again, disrespect is a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. When somebody says \u201cIt\u2019s a black thing\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit,\u201d I immediately understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nNo question is more annoying than \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a black thing? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Especially coming from black people. You\u2019re just being contrarian or your parents REALLY tried to hide some shit from you. Mine didn\u2019t. I get it. And I always get it. And well, \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit\u201d is just one of those things that I believe growing up in a black household helped to crystallize, and largely covers the world of parenting, dancing, living, outdoor survival, near-death experiences for hobby or sport, and all other forms of noncolored active activities.\n\n10. I think being black is awesome and not some pathological condition that is full of negativity.\n\nI was raised to enjoy my blackness and believe that it didn\u2019t define me in any negative way. In fact, I believe that being black has only helped me out in life, whether through hard lessons and soft behinds or just by enjoying and appreciating seeing others succeed who know my life. Point is, growing up in my household helped me see pride, power and a bad-ass mudda who don\u2019t take no crap offa nobody.", "keywords": ["music", "glad", "ive", "household", "raised", "white", "dont", "shit", "black", "think", "reasons", "im", "know", "grew"], "polarity": 0.06031739351183798, "subjectivity": 0.4363167610852791},

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["riots", "panther", "wanted", "njobu", "history", "black", "killmonger", "revisionist", "help", "cant", "tchalla", "know", "folks"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas. Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald brought FLOTUS to life using oil on linen using a more modern touch, using her signature gray palette.\n\nThis moment, with black artists celebrating black accomplishments, was lost on no one, least of all the Obamas, who noted that they were the first in their families to sit for a portrait.\n\n\u201cI am humbled, I am honored, I am proud. I am so incredibly grateful to all the people who came before me in this journey. The folks who built the foundation upon which I stand,\u201d Michelle Obama told the audience who came to celebrate the big moment. \u201cI am also thinking about all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think again, wow. What an incredible journey we are on together in this country.\u201d\n\nIn true Michelle Obama fashion, the first lady in her choice of artist, and in her choice of dress, chose to share her spotlight with rising stars. The dress featured in the portrait was designed by Michelle Smith\u2019s label Milly, and even that had extreme significance, with Sherald sharing how the geometric patterns reminded her of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, black community in Alabama known for its quilt masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former FLOTUS portrait captures her seated, with one hand tucked under her chin as she stares out at those surveying her. Her expression cool, confident, unflinching.\n\n\u201cThe act of Michelle Obama being her authentic self became a profound statement that engaged all of us, because what you represent to this country is an ideal, a human being with integrity, intellect, confidence and compassion,\u201d Sherald, the winner of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, a rising star in the art world, told the audience.\n\nThe former President, on the other hand, was his usual charming self (please come back) , joking as he surveyed his colorful and vibrant portrait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKehinde relative to Amy was working at a disadvantage because his subject was less becoming,\u201d he quipped. \u201cNot as fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less grey hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked. I tried to negotiate smaller ears, struck out on that as well,\u201d the former president said as the audience chuckled.\n\nBarack Obama was painted sitting on a wooden chair among dense foliage with pops of colorful flowers. That was a purposeful touch by artist Wiley, who noted that some of the flowers carry special meaning to the president and his journey through life. The chrysanthemums give a nod to Chicago, the jasmine evokes Hawaii, where the President grew up, and of course the African blue lilies give nod to his Kenyan heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ability to be the first African American to paint the first African American President of the United States; it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI was humbled by this invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr President I thank you for giving me a chance, and I thank you for giving this nation a chance to experience your splendor on a global scale,\u201d the artist added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newest additions to the gallery will be on view to the public beginning Feb. 13.", "keywords": ["unveiling", "moment", "portrait", "president", "obama", "official", "barack", "artist", "using", "african", "told", "shining", "history", "black", "obamas", "michelle", "wiley"], "polarity": 0.15363906926406928, "subjectivity": 0.39663419913419906},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["trend", "rock", "ongoing", "argument", "love", "right", "stella", "appropriationvsappreciation", "ankara", "kwanzaa", "style", "african", "wearing", "black", "fashion", "ankhs", "know", "way"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

But it\u2019s not tragic, and it\u2019s not pathological, and it doesn\u2019t feel disempowering or discouraging. ... You know, we can talk about us black women as writers and artists and filmmakers and creatives and all these different things,\u2019\u201d Ronke told The Glow Up.\n\n\u201cSo, at the same time, we can also have conversations about this violence and about these issues ... but within these conversations will be more of a position of power,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe won\u2019t feel victimized or objectified or like a stereotype, but more like witches and healers and conjurers and problem-solvers and scientists and doctors ... just kind of, like, shifting energy around the conversation that takes place where black women are the focus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result was a mobile library of black female-centric books, where participants are encouraged to give one and take one, all in an effort to advance black female narratives.\n\n\u201cIt was my love of books and my wanting to connect with people around black women, but in a way that felt like a celebration or an honoring or an affirming,\u201d Ronke noted.\n\nSince launching three years ago, the library has grown to approximately 900 books. It was initially primarily based on donations but is now moving into sponsorships and collaborations.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["mother", "situation", "pain", "right", "mothers", "rest", "lives", "dormeus", "theres", "wont", "hes", "gaines", "speaks", "korryn", "child", "family", "baltimore"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference.

A firebombing at the Everses\u2019 home in Jackson, Miss., forced Medgar and Myrlie to subject their young children to duck-and-cover drills in case of future terror attacks.\n\n\u201cI often wondered how Medgar could tolerate the anger and the hatred that was shown to him\u2014to his people, to all of us. How could he do it and not go off on some kind of rampage?\u201d Evers-Williams recalled in a recent interview. \u201cI told him I don\u2019t think I would be able to do it. He would just look at me and shake his head and say, \u2018Forget about yourself, it\u2019s larger than you. It\u2019s about all of us.\u201d\n\nThen, late on a Wednesday night in June 1963, a Klansman named Byron De La Beckwith hid in the bushes with a rifle and shot Medgar Evers in the back. It took three juries and more than 30 years to put Beckwith behind bars, where he died. After everything that her family endured, it\u2019s easy to understand why Evers-Williams, who grew up in Vicksburg, Miss., had difficulty trusting the state of Mississippi.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, on Saturday, Evers-Williams will be seated alongside fellow civil rights veterans, political officials and other dignitaries to help cut the ribbon for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson. President Donald Trump, who was endorsed by Medgar Evers\u2019 brother, Charles, is also scheduled to attend the ceremony. This, despite Trump\u2019s own rocky relationship with African Americans, including failing to condemn white nationalists and criticizing black pro athletes for protesting police brutality.\n\nThe grand opening of the nation\u2019s first state-run civil rights museum coincides with the opening of the adjacent Museum of Mississippi History as well as the state\u2019s bicentennial.\n\nThe opening of the two facilities, which together cost upward of $90 million to construct, comes after a series of early controversies about the Civil Rights Museum\u2019s location and the decision to build two museums\u2014quietly derided in some circles as separate but equal buildings, a reference to the prevailing dictum of Jim Crow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Mississippi is embroiled in debate over whether to remove a Confederate battle emblem from its official state flag, the last one in the country to incorporate the Southern cross.\n\nGiven the state\u2019s racial history and unwillingness to let go of vestiges of the Confederacy, the opening also has raised questions about whether a state-government-run museum will tell the whole, ugly truth about the civil rights era.\n\nThese are questions that Pamela Junior, the executive director of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, gets regularly. Junior says that as long as she\u2019s in charge, the museum will tell \u201cthe good, the bad and all of the ugly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the rationale for the two museums, Junior, who was not involved in the early planning of the museum, said the History Museum attempts to cover 50,000 years, only 30 of which include the civil rights movement. By contrast, the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum devotes an entire high-tech facility, complete with exhibits, artifacts, films, meeting space and future programming, to the time period spanning 1619\u2014when the first enslaved Africans arrived at a Jamestown, Va., colony\u2014to 1965 and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe were ground zero for the movement. Why should people go to Memphis [Tenn.] when we were here?\u201d says Junior, referring to the National Civil Rights Museum, housed three hours away at the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated (the National Civil Rights Museum is run by a private foundation, not the state of Tennessee). \u201cWe\u2019re telling the truth. It\u2019s not a wonderful story. It\u2019s beautiful. Then again, it is in darkness that we finally see light. A lot of people went into the tunnel in the state of Mississippi in order to bring light to Mississippi.\u201d\n\nThe museum consists of eight galleries that cover almost 350 years of African-American history in Mississippi, starting with slavery and going through Reconstruction and Jim Crow\u2019s early days; four steel pillars carry the names of people who were lynched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall theaters, with trigger warnings posted out front, highlight pivotal moments in the movement, including the stories of three civil rights workers who were killed near Philadelphia, Miss.; Medgar Evers; and Emmett Till, whose case is the subject of a short film narrated by Mississippi native Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe front doors from the Bryant Grocery and Meat Market in Money, Miss., in which Emmett walked through for the last time in the summer of 1955, are on display.\n\nDeborah Watts, a Till cousin who grew up in Nebraska, was a toddler when Emmett was kidnapped, beaten and murdered after a white woman named Carolyn Bryant said the boy flirted with her and, in the aftermath of his death, his mangled face appeared in Jet magazine. Earlier this year, news reports emerged that Bryant, who is still alive, fabricated parts of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Lynching of Emmett Till\u201d exhibit at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cNAACP\u2019s Man in the Field\u201d exhibit (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\n\u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 1 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 2 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 3 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Gallery entryway (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\nRear view of re-created church (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cIs This America?\u201d exhibit (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\nWide-angle view of gallery 7 of Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Vernon Dahmer exhibit 1 in the Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Vernon Dahmer exhibit 2 in the Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) 1 / 14\n\nWatts remembers that there was such a heavy mourning when Emmett\u2019s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, visited Omaha to give a speech, Watts ripped up flyers that were being distributed about the incident; in her child\u2019s mind, the flyers were the cause of the sadness. Watts, who now lives in the Minneapolis area and founded the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, said that Mississippi went from a place she avoided to some place to which she felt drawn, adding that the Civil Rights Museum represents a new day.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater sense of determination and responsibility to Emmett and those others whose blood was shed there and how important it was for justice to prevail,\u201d Watts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn keeping with the theme of telling ugly-but-whole truths, the .30-06 Enfield rifle Beckwith used to kill Medgar Evers will be on display in one of the theaters; during a film on the Evers story, special lights will illuminate the gun.\n\nHis widow, Evers-Williams, says she is surprised that the rifle was ever recovered, much less ended up in a museum. Yet she is grateful the gun will be on display to send a message that weapons can be used for good but that Beckwith\u2019s rifle was used for \u201cpure evil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople will see it as a weapon that was used to take his life, but also, perhaps, as a weapon that was used\u2014unlike the person who pulled the trigger intended\u2014to lift Medgar up in a way that we understand who he was, how he felt about his state of Mississippi, his people, people as a whole, and how he felt about his country,\u201d Evers-Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Evers-Williams, learning to entrust the state of Mississippi with Medgar\u2019s legacy took some soul-searching. She hopes that the Mississippi museums can be a major force in helping us be what we can be as a nation.\n\n\u201cI am human. I am still angry. I have been able to remove myself from the deep hatred that I felt when my husband was shot down at his door and our children ran out crying, \u2018Daddy, get up! Get up, Daddy.\u2019 But he said don\u2019t hate; work to alleviate it. And with these two museums, I hope there will be people internationally who will learn about Medgar and so many others who stood for justice and equality in this country,\u201d she said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History open to the public on Saturday.

Was it awkward, exhilarating, overwhelming, tender, traumatic\u2014or some combination of all of the above?\n\nMine was all of those things. I was a high schooler in suburban Chicago, in the throes of my first\u2014and at that age, what I believed would be my last\u2014love. Even today, I can sincerely say that it was true\u2014if young\u2014love; and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion, I threw my inexperienced self headlong into it ...\n\nAt least, until my mother found out.\n\nTo say that my mother didn\u2019t take the loss of my virginity well would be putting it mildly. While she\u2019d educated me about sexuality and sexual health since I was 6 years old, I discovered my own sexuality earlier than either of us had planned\u2014if you can plan such a thing. I may have been in love, but for my mother and me, that revelation was mutually traumatic. I was mortified and scared; she was angry, disappointed, and\u2014as I\u2019d come to understand years later\u2014terrified by the thought that I might have compromised myself and my future so early in life.\n\nWhile we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there was something instantly recognizable about last Wednesday\u2019s episode of Grown-ish, in which protagonist Zoey Johnson and mom Rainbow (in a guest appearance by her Black-ish mom, Tracee Ellis Ross) found themselves in much the same situation. In a brief but poignant scene, Zoey revealed to her mother that she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014and had sex for the first time. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked. In the pregnant pause that followed (pun intended), I cringed along with her as she awaited her mother\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2014I just don\u2019t want to think about it ... but did you use protection? ... It was bound to happen at some point,\u201d Rainbow sputtered.\n\n\n\nIt was a refreshing moment\u2014and a departure from the usual conversations that occur around black girls and sexuality, in which we are generally divorced from our own innocence and vulnerability. The truth is, we\u2019re rarely presumed to be in love (or given the space to be), or exercising decision-making based on sexual autonomy and emotional intimacy\u2014let alone smart enough to protect ourselves. Instead, we\u2019re generally cast as over-sexualized and often \u201casking for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Zoey\u2019s being of college age was likely another key factor in how this scenario played out, even as a fictional mother (and doctor), Rainbow understood that sexuality was a natural part of her daughter\u2019s maturation. She also seemed to understand that that development wasn\u2019t destined to happen on her time. Her primary concerns\u2014aside from her child\u2019s physical safety\u2014were not for her daughter\u2019s \u201cpurity,\u201d but for the larger implications of her making what could be a lifelong commitment at such a young age; in this case, to leave college with a potentially NBA-bound boyfriend.\n\n\u201cZoey, I did not raise you like this,\u201d Rainbow ranted. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman who\u2019s just going to throw it all away for some guy? You worked so hard to get here!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the writers\u2019 room at Grown-ish really got it right this episode. Because instead of focusing on the loss of virginity (which didn\u2019t even merit its own scene), the focus was rightly placed on what it means for a black girl to commit herself to someone\u2014in mind and body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the discussion I wish my mother and I had had all those years ago. I wish she\u2019d trusted that she\u2019d taught me well on how to conduct myself physically, and focused on the emotional implications of my choice. Because while we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAs I\u2019ve since discussed with my mother, rarely does anyone tell young women what it\u2019ll be like when you first fall for someone\u2014and they, in turn, fall for you. Rarely does anyone tell you how overwhelming that will be, and how you\u2019ll do anything to hold on to that feeling. Beyond discussing sexual health\u2014and, now, rape culture\u2014rarely are we preparing our daughters to trust themselves emotionally, and to take their own agency sexually.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m personally grateful that a show like Grown-ish exists for this generation. Because as a member of several older generations of folks who often seem to lack the emotional intelligence to have productive, mutually respectful relationships, I think that maybe these are the conversations we need to be having.", "keywords": ["mother", "leave", "love", "mothers", "right", "sexuality", "grownish", "talk", "rainbow", "emotional", "daughters", "shed", "sexual", "weeks", "rarely"], "polarity": 0.15486830357142856, "subjectivity": 0.5726875},

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles.

There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop.

He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people.

The police were called to the scene after being \u201calerted to an actor with a gun.\u201d But Anita Williams, Mark Daniels\u2019 aunt, claimed that her nephew did not own or carry a gun. She also claimed that while Daniels was in the hospital, his body was guarded by \u201cfour or five\u201d police officers and his family wasn\u2019t allowed to see him.\n\nThe case is currently being investigated, as is the case with all fatal police-involved shootings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this from the Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pittsburgh police officer who fatally shot a man during an exchange of gunfire in Homewood on Feb. 11 has been involved in two other shootings in the past 10 months. Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday. It\u2019s at least the third time in recent months Officer Macioce has opened fire while on the job in Zone 5. He was involved in non-fatal shootings in January and April, court records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2017, Macioce shot 20-year-old Christopher Howard, who robbed two women in the area, was approached and chased by Macioce and allegedly pulled out a sawed-off shotgun. Macioce shot Howard, forcing him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in January 2018, Macioce was involved in the shooting of 26-year-old Eric Farrar, who allegedly was carrying a shotgun, dropped it when the officers ordered him to and then reached into his waistband for a pistol to fire at them. Macioce and a second officer on the scene shot and critically wounded him.\n\nNow, is it possible that each of these shootings was justified and that Macioce just happened to be the officer on the scene each time? Yes, that is possible. Is it also possible that Macioce happened to have three criminals separately attempt to shoot him in less than a year\u2019s time? Yes, that is possible. Considering that many officers can go entire 30-year careers without anyone shooting at them, is it possible that Macioce is just unfathomably unlucky? Yes, that is possible.\n\nRegardless of the possibilities, it\u2019s definitely true that violence keeps finding Gino Macioce. Or perhaps violence doesn\u2019t have to look that hard because Macioce keeps looking for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since it\u2019s true that each man Macioce shot was black, it\u2019s also possible that Gino Macioce just keeps finding reasons to shoot black people.", "keywords": ["possible", "officer", "shootings", "shot", "macioce", "kills", "officers", "black", "yes", "daniels", "scene", "pittsburgh", "cop", "shoots"], "polarity": 0.004166666666666665, "subjectivity": 0.53671875},

Because Sessions straight up lied during his Senate confirmation hearing, claiming that he\u2019d never met with Russian officials, he recused himself from all Russia-related matters.\n\nNow, according to several reports, Trump was not only pissed that Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he reportedly ordered his top lawyer to try to stop Sessions from doing so.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House counsel Don McGahn, acting on orders from the president, tried but failed to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself.\n\nNBC News reports that McGahn and several White House officials called Sessions to insist that he not recuse himself, but Sessions had already made up his mind after reports surfaced that Sessions had conveniently forgotten to disclose contacts he\u2019d had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter recusing himself in March, Sessions would suddenly remember several interactions he had with Russians during Senate committee hearings in June and October.\n\nA White House lawyer for Trump, Ty Cobb, told NBC News that he had no comment on the Times report.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump administration has been vocal about Sessions\u2019 recusal.

And again, her name is Nkechi now, legally. Sure, you love you some white women, but you get to act like you managed to find the blackest one out there. She\u2019s even a playable card in the race-centric game Trading Races, where the goal is to debate the blackest person in the deck. That\u2019s a win-win.\n\n4.

At $18.99 it might make the best Secret Santa or White Elephant gift of all time ... as long as nobody has to divulge what came from whom.\n\nHow annoyed would you be if you pulled this gift? On the flip side, if you work in a white office, it might be hilarious and telling to see how folks respond to this calendar.\n\n6. It\u2019s also a perfect petty gift. I believe in petty.\n\nYour sister has been acting better than other people? Cool. Catch this December Dolezal, b.

Because maybe you don\u2019t actually find her that problematic.\n\nThere are some folks who actually don\u2019t have a problem with her or her antics. They don\u2019t view them as antics at all, in fact, but as a woman living her truth. Well, this is how you can show your real support for her. Nothing says \u201cI support this motherfucker\u201d like paying for a whole-ass calendar of that person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9.

The reader follows Jenkins, now 25, just a few miles but a lifetime away to New York City, where she is eager to land bylines at the world\u2019s top publications.\n\nAlong the way, Jerkins takes the reader to deeply personal and, at times, uncomfortable places. She chronicles her struggles with dating and heartbreak, unflinchingly guides her reader through a personal surgical procedure and wrestles with a variety of different gazes: that of white men and white women, but also of potential lovers, of her host families and other people in Japan and Russia, of her black female peers and, most important, her own evolving view of herself.\n\nThe work-in-progress nature shows at times. Gay mentioned in a recent interview with Jerkins in Elle magazine that \u201cthere are places where I wanted [Jerkins] to push her conclusions further,\u201d and Jerkins\u2019 approach to certain topics likely won\u2019t be appreciated by everyone. Jerkins\u2019 feminism includes unbowed self-advocacy, and some readers may find fault with the way she calls out specific people and their behaviors, including some high-profile black women. For her part, Jerkins says she \u201cstands by the book and everything I wrote in it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting it all out there, she said in conversation with The Glow Up, is the whole point.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed.]\n\n\n\nOn writing about having labiaplasty\u2014and other taboo subjects:\n\n\u201cI was worried about what my mother would think, what my father would think, the church in which I was raised would think. The men whom I haven\u2019t even met, I wondered what they would think\u2014would I be unattractive to them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the book was just to lay it all out there on the table, and not with the aim that you agree with me, but that you at least have an understanding of where I\u2019m coming from. I probably look at certain chapters where I talk about dating or where I talk about my labiaplasty, and I\u2019ll look at it and I\u2019ll still feel that reverberation\u2014like, you had to go there?\u201d\n\nOn revealing the more unflattering parts of her experiences:\n\n\u201cWriting about yourself isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. Anytime you feel nervous about writing about something, I believe that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right track. ... I had to keep telling myself, \u2018Stop worrying about that invisible person and whether or not they\u2019re going to be freaked out by it or whatever. Think about the people that might read a little bit more expansively because of what you\u2019ve said. Or don\u2019t think of anybody. Write what needs to be said. What you want it to say.\u2019 That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the pain of being called \u201cintimidating\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe worst thing someone can say about me in a personal sense, because I\u2019ve heard other media outlets say this about me, is that I\u2019m intimidating. Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["life", "dressed", "dj", "women", "wardrobe", "sophia", "york", "inside", "feel", "night", "hyacinthe", "think", "double", "fashion", "really", "career", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength.

Dean Graziolli, who was working security at the Corner Alley bowling alley and bar.\n\nYatsko\u2019s mother, Melissa, was shocked when she discovered what had happened to her son. She said that no one had contacted her about her son until news reporters began calling her Tuesday morning.\n\nShe didn\u2019t think it unusual that he hadn\u2019t come home, since Thomas often spent time at his girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.\n\nCleveland police spokesperson Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said that officers tried to contact Thomas\u2019 father, who does not live with Melissa Yatsko, several times. Officers even apparently left a note on the father\u2019s home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to police, the situation started around 11 p.m. Saturday when Thomas Yatsko reportedly got into a fight. The brawlers, including Yatsko, were kicked out of the bar.\n\nPolice say that Yatsko then returned and attacked Graziolli, who pulled out his gun and fired the fatal shots. A witness told the news site that he heard two gunshots.\n\nOne witness called 911 from the bar, telling dispatchers that she saw Yatsko and a friend fighting before they were both kicked out. Graziolli was the one who escorted them out of the bar. One of the two friends who were kicked out told the officer to \u201cleave him alone\u201d because he was cooperating, the witness told the dispatcher, according to Cleveland.com.\n\nThe caller noted that the off-duty officer then got into a fight with a customer before shooting him. The woman said that Yatsko was awake after the shooting and breathing but was bleeding heavily. Nurses at the bar tried to help him and get the bleeding to stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet another caller told the dispatcher that Graziolli never tried to use his stun gun or an alternative method during the apparent fight. Officials have not confirmed whether Graziolli tried to use lesser force before firing his weapon.\n\nCiaccia did confirm, however, that a preliminary investigation into the incident showed that Yatsko was unarmed. The Cuyahoga County Sheriff\u2019s Department is now investigating the shooting.\n\nGraziolli\u2019s union said that the officer suffered injuries, including cuts and bruises to his head, face and body, during the altercation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sergeant is currently on administrative leave and has been placed on light duty in the department\u2019s gym until the Sheriff\u2019s Department finishes its investigation.\n\nIn the meantime, Yatsko\u2019s family and community are left to remember a young man who enjoyed helping people and putting smiles on their faces.\n\nDuring the most recent winter storm, he made it a point to go around shoveling his neighbor\u2019s driveways and helping the homeless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com, a few days ago Yatsko, who was working full time at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, noticed a homeless man counting pennies just trying to buy a single doughnut. The man came up short, but Thomas gave him six doughnuts, free of charge.\n\n\u201cHe always would do that for people who didn\u2019t have money,\u201d his mother said. \u201cHe told me that day, \u2018These people come in and they\u2019re so miserable, and I just want to make them smile.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegular customers would often ask for him by name, Michelle Yatsko added.\n\nHe had stopped working at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts to take a job at PCC Airfoil in Mentor, Ohio, inspecting metal used to make industrial gas turbines, but after his car broke down and he couldn\u2019t make the commute, he returned to Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPCC promised him that his job would be waiting for him if he got his transport organized.\n\n\u201cThey loved him there,\u201d she said.\n\nHe was also a great role model and father figure to his two younger brothers, 17-year-old Anthony and 16-year-old Tyler, encouraging them to go to college, the site notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was a good mentor,\u201d Anthony said of his brother. \u201cHe was hard on us.

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain.

None of the lawmakers who probably represent Haitians and Nigerians walked out of the room and told the press about Trump\u2019s tirade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the fact that there is no evidence any of these men encouraged Trump to say these words, even though they did not endorse his statement, they remained silent. They knew.\n\nThese men are white supremacists.\n\nEvery headline you will read about Trump\u2019s comments will place the blame solely on him and adeptly leap over the obvious fact that he felt comfortable enough in the company of this gaggle of old white men to disparage the residents of an entire country with his racist tangent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent revelations are not just an indictment of Trump\u2019s racism; they are indicative of the attitudes of every single person in that room.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the ethereal concept of \u201cnormalizing\u201d racism.

The city where he was born and where he lived didn\u2019t even try to honor King until Robert Woodruff, president of Coca-Cola, decided to sponsor a banquet. He still couldn\u2019t get the white elite to attend until the New York Times wrote a scathing article about the efforts to undermine the event and Coca-Cola threatened to leave the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the tickets sold out, many people assumed that King would take it easy on the powerful people who had reluctantly gathered to honor him. When he gave his speech, he spoke directly to the powerful men who had remained quiet during the brutality of the civil rights movement:\n\nHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was wrong, though.\n\nHistory has yet to record the tragedy of the people who sat silently in the room on Thursday when Trump besmirched the nation of Haiti and other black and brown countries. History still has not listed the names in the room when he said that Haitians \u201call have AIDS\u201d and Nigerians live in huts. Their names are nowhere to be found alongside the list of neo-Nazis and Klansmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was King incorrect when he assured us of history\u2019s note-taking, but he was doubly wrong when he described the people who remained appallingly silent as \u201cgood people.\u201d Sidestepping evil for the sake of political favor or not upsetting the apple cart is the opposite of \u201cgood.\u201d These people are co-conspirators. They are accomplices. They are guilty of aiding and abetting by providing material support to white supremacy.\n\nNot only are they at fault, but they join a long list of those complicit with Trump\u2019s brand of racism. Their names should appear alongside those of the pearl-clutching congregation of reporters, celebrities and generic-label white people distancing themselves from \u201cthe Donald\u201d as they pretend to just realize that he has racist tendencies.\n\nThey should register with the 53 percent of white women who voted for a robeless Klansman, along with the lawmakers who embrace him and his policies. The names of kowtowing Negroes like Steve Harvey, Ray Lewis, Stephen A. Smith, Omarosa Manigault Newman and Chrisette Michele, who implored us to respect a man who would shit down our throats for the spectacle of it, should be etched into those history books, too. They all worked on the road crew that paved the way for a white supremacist to gain respect and power. They paid for the fuel in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why I am never ashamed to say that I voted for someone just because he or she is black. This is why \u201cdiversity\u201d can never be a bad word. If we are not seated at the table, not only are our voices unheard, but the evil ones are emboldened. This is why \u201cnot all white people\u201d rings hollow in my ears. All the white people in the room at both events stayed silent. Silence is racism. Racism is evil.\n\nThose same silent voices omitted from history will probably participate in the praising of Martin Luther King Jr. this weekend. They will talk about freedom and equality for all people. They will do it loudly and publicly because they know that they will always have the opportunity to slit our throats behind closed doors without a single objection.\n\nOur only hope remains in the unseen recompense of the invisible, omnipotent God who King believed would avenge the sins of these evil men. He told us: \u201cThe hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess we\u2019ll have to wait for that.\n\nI just hope they don\u2019t run out of room.", "keywords": ["martin", "silence", "jr", "shithole", "men", "racism", "white", "room", "say", "trumps", "silent", "king", "evil", "luther", "names"], "polarity": -0.049145809490637064, "subjectivity": 0.4577242042759285},

The documents say Edwards was \u2018bed bound and immobile.\u2019\n\n\u201cDennis Edwards was removed from the home because of medical issues, according to the Jan. 12 document.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAn emergency protective order against Brenda Edwards was granted Jan. 18, barring her from contact with Dennis Edwards. A hearing that would have allowed Brenda Edwards to respond to the allegations was scheduled for Friday, but was canceled after her husband\u2019s death the day before.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe protective order was vacated on Friday, after Dennis Edwards\u2019 death. . . .\u201d\n\nThough Edwards most recently lived in Chicago, he also had lived in St. Louis County, Mo. (video), and in Detroit, where Motown was based. Kevin C. Johnson, the Post-Dispatch\u2019s pop music critic, had a tagline on the story. He told Journal-isms by email on Thursday, \u201cI believe my getting the information first had everything to do with my having covered Dennis Edwards for the past twenty years here in St. Louis where they lived for a long time, and getting to know him and his wife in doing so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe morning after I wrote the obituary, I got an email from his daughter, a family member I had never encountered, and she made me aware of her claims against Dennis\u2019 wife. I also received a second email, from a person who looked to be legal representation, with the court paperwork attached. I forwarded all info to the news desk immediately, to a reporter more experienced in legal ins and outs, and it went on from there.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he has been a reporter for 30 years and pop music writer for 20, but felt that the news side would be best to handle the story. \u201cI helped out where I could,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLongtime Motown writer Susan Whitall of the Detroit News was also on the story.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy editor at the News had me do an obit on Dennis,\u201d Whitall told Journal-isms by email. \u201cI\u2019d interviewed him several times over the years, and I\u2019d written a lot about Norman Whitfield and the whole psychedelic soul era of the Tempts. I\u2019d just done a long essay about \u2018Papa was a Rollin\u2019 Stone\u2019 and the use of classical musicians at Motown for the Kresge Foundation last year.\n\n\u201cAfter the obit on Dennis ran, I started hearing from various sources about what might be going on. I reached out to some varied sources, they reached back to me. As usual one thing leads to another, and yeah \u2014 quite a lot had been going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of sources trusting you, and also \u2014 the documents. So much is in there.\u201d\n\nWhitall wrote a more detailed story with staff writer Oralandar Brand-Williams. In addition to a denial of wrongdoing from Edwards\u2019 wife, carried by both news outlets, Whitall quoted one of Edwards\u2019 daughters, Issa Pointer-Stewart, who was appointed the singer\u2019s power of attorney, saying she never heard his doctors say he had meningitis, the purported cause of death.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been working on it since Saturday when my colleague Motown beat writer Susan Whitall first had a conversation with an Edwards family member and was ready to go,\u201d Brand-Williams messaged, referring to the story. \u201cAlways wanting our reporting to be solid, we just needed the cops statement and Brenda Edwards comments so we went up a few hours later than the STL Post Dispatch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhitall elaborated, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked to put details in stories, where possible. It\u2019s a human being, not just a name on a protection order. And for Detroiters, Motown stars are personal, in many cases they are also from our neighborhoods. I once asked Dennis the usual Detroit question \u2014 what were your cross streets? It was Chene and Gratiot, for him. Cass Tech. Eastern High.

Whereas black people were roundly condemned for rioting after police shootings in Ferguson and Baltimore, critics said, white people rioting after a football victory in Philadelphia got a free pass.\n\n\u201c \u2018You can riot if you\u2019re white and your team wins, but if you\u2019re black and being killed, you can\u2019t speak out,\u2019 declared Hawk Newsome, president of Black Lives Matter New York.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a point. People here have been sharing video of the Philadelphia mayhem on social media, drawing likes and laughs. How many of these folks giggled when rioters set fires and turned over cars in Ferguson and Baltimore? That was serious, and \u2014 for white people \u2014 it was scary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut while whites certainly represented the majority of the revelers after Super Bowl, there were lots of black people out on the streets as well. And if you don\u2019t think they engaged in the same ugly behaviors as everyone else, watch the videos yourself. You\u2019ll see.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what truly marks this moment as different from typical patterns of violence in cities like Philadelphia. Across our history, periodic outbreaks of hostility have pit the races against each other.

Franklin, who directly confronted America\u2019s racist history and helped shaped the discourse around America\u2019s legacy of slavery. The stretch of road was dedicated to the influential scholar Monday afternoon at the Hayti Heritage Center.\n\n\n\nAs the Raleigh News and Observer notes, Franklin\u2019s name on a Southern roadway, which will now be called Dr. John H. Franklin Highway, is significant, particularly in North Carolina. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when visitors and residents entering the Tar Heel State were confronted with a welcome sign from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this www.newsobserver.com embed.\n\nFranklin, who died in 2009, was described by fellow historian Nell Irvin Painter as \u201cthe first great American historian to reckon the price [America] owed in violence, autocracy and militarism.\u201d\n\nFranklin meticulously documented African-American history. In 1947 he published From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African-Americans, described in his New York Times obituary as \u201cone of the definitive historical surveys of the American black experience\u201d and by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel as \u201ca landmark in the interpretation of American civilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Duke University professor was among the first American scholars to confront the hypocrisy of America\u2019s ideals against its history of white supremacy. In one of his final works, a 2007 article for the Atlantic Monthly, Franklin wrote that \u201cif the American idea was to fight every war from the beginning of colonization to the middle of the 20th century with Jim Crow armed forces, in the belief that this would promote the American idea of justice and equality, then the American idea was an unmitigated disaster and a denial of the very principles that this country claimed as its rightful heritage.\u201d\n\nAs the Times wrote, Franklin earned many \u201cfirsts\u201d throughout his storied career. He was the first black president of the American Historical Association and the first black person to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association, which was segregated at the time (the group later elected him as its president). He was also the first black professor to serve as department chair in a majority-white institution (Brooklyn College).\n\nFranklin also applied his gifts as a scholar to the fight for civil rights, working on Thurgood Marshall\u2019s legal team in the Brown v. Board of Education case, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down \u201cseparate but equal\u201d schooling in 1954. For his contributions, Franklin received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from Bill Clinton in 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFranklin was originally from Oklahoma, but North Carolina became his adopted home state.\n\n\u201cDurham and the entire state of North Carolina were blessed to become his home,\u201d North Carolina Gov.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Be ready. Your Facebook cousins ended 2017 in grand style with an argument about rings, which they will surely resurrect. An alleged Kay Jewelers ad for a $24.99 engagement ring had married and single women debating if wanting a more expensive ring made them gold diggers or not.\n\nSo before they reprise their battle royal, I want to talk about why we all should let women get engaged without telling them to lower their demands\u2014for rings or anything else.\n\n\n\nThe internet refers to women as a \u201cpick me\u201d when they seem to bend over backward to accommodate potential mates. Women with obsequious opinions on relationships aren\u2019t necessarily jockeying for a man to notice them. Sure, they might be annoying at times, but I keep my complexion clear by remembering there is someone for everyone. I simply am not here for telling other women how low they must go to find love. As bad as a \u201cpick me\u201d can look, it has nothing on a woman boasting about how cheaply she got picked for.\n\nI find it tacky when married women tell single women how their love didn\u2019t cost a thing and expect their unmarried counterparts to follow suit. Sis, I admire your struggle love, really, I do. But that doesn\u2019t have to be every woman\u2019s narrative.\n\nTheir stories try to convey that the quality of the ring doesn\u2019t determine the quality of the relationship. I applaud that. Collectively, however, the overwhelming message turns into: \u201cHe picked me for less, and you should ask for less, too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s OK if some women want a ring that costs more than a Popeyes chicken bucket. But single women who dare express this truth hear two ugly lies about themselves:\n\n1. \u201cWomen are more concerned about the engagement ring than the marriage.\u201d\n\nHow important is a ring, anyway?\n\nWe aren\u2019t all going to agree on the answer to that question. And you know what? That\u2019s perfectly fine. You can point out that the popularity of the diamond engagement ring is the result of marketing\u2014and you would be right. If you start to unravel many traditions behind weddings, they are often rooted in misogyny or money, not romance. It is a saving grace that wedding rituals evolved over time to signify something beautiful. We fall in love with the symbolism and create our own reasons as to why it matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA ring is merely one symbol in a social rite full of symbols: changing one\u2019s name, walking down the aisle, jumping the broom, breaking the glass. Neither the ceremony nor the traditions surrounding weddings hold much import in the actual marriage.\n\nThis is why I do not understand the vitriol and \u201cgold digger\u201d labels reserved for women who value the ring as a token of affection. It is asinine to castigate other women for adhering to one expendable nuptial custom when you probably have your own.\n\nMost women aren\u2019t more concerned about engagement rings than about their (impending or imagined) marriages. Arguments that women who give thought to their rings are \u201cfocusing on the wrong thing\u201d present a false binary. You can ask for the ring you prefer and put a lot of care into your marital relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cWomen should be so happy to receive a proposal; they should accept anything.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, I see a proposal as the introduction to a lifetime of partnership and work, not an honorific. Marriage is not a validation that women should be thankful to receive. But I saw one message from a woman scolding others: \u201cSomebody actually wanted you! Sit down! Be humble!\u201d\n\nI have a serious problem with people telling black women that they should be grateful anyone proposes to them at all. Black women are often cast as undesirable in the American imagination. It works a raw nerve to hear us tell one another that we are unworthy of material or emotional good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInasmuch as we should all express gratitude for finding love in this world, it\u2019s another thing entirely to consider a proposal as a charity. \u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\nFurthermore, a ring is a gift you\u2019re expected to wear day in and day out. What is so reprehensible about trying to find a ring a woman likes? Can we even apply the rule that \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d if the gift reflects thoughtlessness? Any token offered without the recipient in mind is a bribe for a compliment.\n\nMost women are not arguing that a man they truly love should go bankrupt on a ring. Women want to feel consideration, and they want a ring they don\u2019t hate. If the issue is affordability, and a woman inflexibly demands something her beau can\u2019t afford, that couple has bigger fish to fry than carats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut were we really arguing over $25 rings ... or something else?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t believe a conversation about \u201cungrateful\u201d women and cheap engagement rings is actually about rings at all. The unspoken contention is that (black) women are not allowed to have a floor, a preference, a bare minimum, a shred of a standard in their own love story. We are expected not to find someone who would willingly be what we desire and require, but to ask for little and be overjoyed at just enough. And apparently, \u201ctoo much\u201d is a ring over $25.\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day, don\u2019t be that married person lecturing singles about how your beau had nothing to offer but his undying love and twin bed. I know you gladly accepted an engagement ring fished out of a Cracker Jack box. Yes, we know your 20-year marriage is going strong, even though it didn\u2019t start out with the Rock of Gibraltar on your finger. Your examples show us that true love can thrive with less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut love is just as beautiful when it finds us worthy of what we ask for, even if it\u2019s more.", "keywords": ["woman", "women", "love", "thing", "picked", "ring", "bragging", "ask", "rings", "telling", "pick", "day", "worse", "engagement"], "polarity": 0.1393052079933268, "subjectivity": 0.5276680690047028},

Gaines\u2019 mother and father were awarded $307,000 and $300,000, respectively, and $300,000 was awarded to the Gaines estate.

Activists cited her shooting as yet another example of police officers using excessive force against black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers showed up to Gaines\u2019 apartment at 9 a.m. that fateful day to serve arrest warrants on her and her fiance.\n\nAssistant County Attorney James S.

Gaines, 23, remained inside her Randallstown apartment with tactical officers stationed in the hallway outside for six hours.\n\nRuby, who would ultimately kill Gaines and injure her young son, was posted just outside her apartment door\u2014which was cracked open.\n\nRuckle claimed that Ruby was in danger because although he was wearing tactical gear, his arms, legs and face were exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ruckle, Ruby decided to fire into the apartment when he saw Gaines and her son go into the kitchen. The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun?

That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["mother", "situation", "pain", "right", "mothers", "rest", "lives", "dormeus", "theres", "wont", "hes", "gaines", "speaks", "korryn", "child", "family", "baltimore"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

What happened next is still up for debate.\n\nThe LAPD says that the man resisted, fought with the cops and eventually tried to grab an officer\u2019s gun. The man\u2019s family says that he was unarmed and suffering from mental illness and was a victim of police brutality. A bystander\u2019s video showed officers manhandling, punching and choking the Cameroonian man. There is only one thing that every party agrees on:\n\nAn officer of the LAPD shot and killed Charly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang.\n\nIt seems like it would be an easy thing to clear up. At least three officers on the scene were outfitted with body cameras that captured the incident. But for three years the city of Los Angeles refused to release the footage, until the Los Angeles Times, after a lengthy court battle, obtained the videos from those bodycams on Tuesday.\n\nThe videos show Keunang standing in front of his tent arguing with policemen as Francisco Martinez, an officer who Skid Row residents called a \u201chard-ass bitch cop,\u201d threatens to shoot Keunang with a Taser. Keunang goes back inside his tent and tells the officers to \u201cleave me alone.\u201d As Keunang exits his tent again, the video shows Martinez tasing him. At least three officers pounce on him. You can hear and see another cop, Daniel Torres, using his Taser directly against Charly\u2019s body as the officers yell, \u201cStop resisting!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinez\u2019s partner, Joshua Volasgis, punches Keunang \u201ctwo, three times in the facial area,\u201d he tells investigators, according to Jeff Sharlet of GQ magazine, who reviewed the footage and the police reports.\n\nKeunang is caught in the wire from two Tasers. He is being shocked repeatedly. He is being punched. He begins spinning wildly. Volasgis shouts: \u201cHe has my gun! He has my gun!\u201d\n\nThen an officer raises his gun and shoots Charly Keunang.\n\nThe officers look for Volasgis\u2019 gun in Charly\u2019s hand, but it is not in Charly\u2019s hand. It is not on the ground. It is not in the tent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gun is still in Volasgis\u2019 holster.\n\nThe LAPD released an \u201cenhanced image\u201d from another officer\u2019s camera that supposedly shows Keunang grabbing an officer\u2019s weapon, although the family\u2019s attorneys say that they cannot see it. Eleven months later, a closed-door hearing conducted by the Los Angeles Police Commission would reach the same conclusion: that Keunang died after grabbing a policeman\u2019s weapon. City prosecutors would never file charges against the officers.\n\nCharly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang is dead.\n\nStill.\n\nHe would be approximately the 175th person shot and killed by police in 2015, according to GQ magazine.

She and her husband, Jamal, planned three parties over one weekend and had $43,000 in cash on hand that her husband was taking to the bank around 11 a.m. As Jamal stopped to talk to his friends, Baltimore City Sgt. Wayne Jenkins and his partner pulled up and searched his car.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey find a small bag of marijuana, but that\u2019s a lie. But they use it as an opportunity to arrest him,\u201d defense attorney Ivan Bates told The Root. \u201cThey submit $23,000 and keep $20,000 for themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Bates, this was a regular tactic used by Baltimore City police to get the addresses of people whom they considered high rollers because they had expensive cars.\n\n\n\nThey then went to Jovonne Walker\u2019s house and tried to break in. Jovonne was so frightened that she pushed the silent alarm button. According to Bates, a new set of officers showed up in response to the alarm, but Jenkins and his partner said that they would handle it. They searched the house without a warrant, saying that Jovonne agreed to let them search. They later went back and obtained a warrant. They found two guns that Jovonne owned, and charged her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the aftermath of their arrests, the couple almost lost their house. Jamal, who worked as an electrician, wasn\u2019t able to get some clearances to work. One of their cars was repossessed.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo have your life turned upside down for almost two years, to not be able to work in a field that you\u2019re passionate about because you have pending charges. Fearing for my kids\u2019 life because someone was trying to get into our home. It was unfair,\u201d said Jovonne in a press conference with other victims of misconduct by the officers in the Gun Trace Task Force who were prosecuted by federal officials.\n\n\n\nThe federal conviction of eight of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s former Gun Trace Task Force officers\u2014Detectives Daniel T. Hersl, Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Jemell Rayam, Maurice Ward and Marcus R. Taylor, and Sgts. Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner. It\u2019s gonna take a while to change the culture. But you have to prosecute the officers that are doing it and hold them accountable.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["covered", "jovonne", "officers", "bates", "killings", "jenkins", "house", "city", "gun", "say", "sold", "abuse", "pick", "drugs", "pieces", "baltimore", "stole"], "polarity": 0.020850306342109614, "subjectivity": 0.40127510922592896},

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

Of course, it is a fictional comic book tale that could never really happen.\n\nExcept it did.\n\nIn 1324 Musa I, the 10th Mansa, or king, of the West African empire of Mali, began his 4,000-mile pilgrimage to Mecca. Before his hajj, the African and the Muslim worlds had heard little about the emperor who was uniting many parts of modern-day Mauritania and Mali (Melle), and the tale was unknown to most of Europe. But after his trip, Mansa Musa literally put the kingdom of Mali on the map, and to this very day, historians universally consider him the richest person who ever lived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo abundant is the gold which is found in his country that he is the richest and most noble king in the land.\u201d \u2014Spanish cartographer, 1375\n\nMusa didn\u2019t gain his wealth through an internet-software startup or the stock market\u2014he got it the old-fashioned way: He earned it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was born around 1280 as \u201cKanga Musa,\u201d a name that refers to his mother, Kankou Hamidou, in the matriarchal Mandinka society. Although his father was not a royal, Musa was appointed a \u201cdeputy\u201d to the empire and assumed the throne in 1312 when the previous king took a pilgrimage to Mecca and did not return.\n\nWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali. Instead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation as he used his control of gold and salts to connect disparate city-states into one empire. It is said that by the end of his life, it would have taken an entire year to go from one end of the Mali empire to the other.\n\nBecause of this, Mansa earned more titles than a Game of Thrones character. He was called Emir of Melle, Lord of the Mines of Wangara, Conqueror of Ghanata, Lion of Mali. The only titles he never earned were Mother of Dragons and King of the North. At its height, scholars say, the kingdom had 400 densely populated cities in the Niger Delta. The University of Sankore in Timbuktu, Mali, still stands where he built it after conquering the area.\n\nWestern Europe was basically the PJs, and Mansa Musa\u2019s West African empire was the deluxe apartment in the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his immense wealth and power, very few outside of Africa knew of Mansa until his pilgrimage. Most accounts say that he took 60,000 men on his trip with him and balled out along the way, much to white people\u2019s dismay.\n\nNever one to be stingy with his money, Musa is reported to have handed out gold bars to poor people along his travel route. Almost every version of his hajj tells the same story: King Musa handed out so much gold to the poor, it actually collapsed the entire gold market in the Middle East! To use the academic terms of macroeconomics, Mansa made it rain so much in da\u2019 club, everyone else in the world look broke by comparison!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did he do to fix this?\n\nIn perhaps the greatest money move ever made, the king borrowed all of the gold his crew could carry from Cairo. Of course he didn\u2019t need it, but the scarcity of the precious metal settled the market. Then, like the baller he was, he simply repaid the Egyptian moneylenders back, plus interest.\n\nI\u2019m sure he also included a note that said: \u201cMy bad. I\u2019m not used to hanging out with broke people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he returned to Mali, Musa brought back some of Spain\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s most prized architects and builders, creating an even wealthier kingdom. Historians say that by the time he returned from Mecca, he controlled most of the gold and salt in the Mediterranean. Coincidentally, this is when the kingdom of Mali began showing up on European maps.\n\nSo when you\u2019re fantasizing about a fictional African kingdom of untold fortune, remember that there was once a real king who could probably have lent T\u2019Challa a few dollars until Wakanda\u2019s vibranium check cleared the bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow and when Mansa Musa died is a topic of fierce debate, but in our extensive research, we could not determine whether Mansa Musa released his tax returns. We could, however, confirm that even after the death of Mansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.", "keywords": ["wakanda", "mansa", "wealth", "europe", "mali", "real", "musa", "african", "gold", "empire", "king", "kingdom"], "polarity": 0.1177283105022831, "subjectivity": 0.409336812350511},

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["eye", "js", "color", "bliges", "opal", "love", "mary", "limit", "look", "sag", "great", "looks", "michael", "black", "price", "awards"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["mother", "situation", "pain", "right", "mothers", "rest", "lives", "dormeus", "theres", "wont", "hes", "gaines", "speaks", "korryn", "child", "family", "baltimore"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

More people died at the hands of police in 2017 than the number of black people who were lynched in the worst year of Jim Crow (161 in 1892). Cops killed more Americans in 2017 than terrorists did (four). They killed more citizens than airplanes (13 deaths worldwide), mass shooters (428 deaths) and Chicago\u2019s \u201ctop gang thugs\u201d (675 Chicago homicides).\n\nYet only 12 officers were charged with a crime related to a shooting death.\n\nAn extensive new study from Mapping Police Violence details the data for police violence. The collective tracks police shooting numbers and statistics, maps the incidents and compiles the data in real time. The site uses information from a number of sources, including Killed by Police, Fatal Encounters and the U.S. Police Shootings Database, to break down shootings by race, location, weapons used, and whether or not the victim was armed.

Twelve had previously shot or killed multiple people.\n\nMost of the people killed (718) were suspects in nonviolent offenses, were stopped for traffic violations or had committed no crime at all.\n\n13 percent of people killed by cops were unarmed.\n\nMost of the unarmed victims were people of color. Of the 147 unarmed people killed by police, 48 were black and 34 were Hispanic.\n\nBlack people accounted for 27 percent of the people killed by law enforcement officers. Of the unarmed victims of police violence, blacks made up 37 percent, almost three times their percentage of the U.S. population (13 percent).\n\nOf the people who were unarmed and not attacking, but were still killed by cops, 35 percent were black.\n\n95 people were killed when police shot at a moving vehicle, a practice that many say should be banned.\n\n170 of the people killed were armed with a knife. in 117 of those incidents, police shot the person before trying any other method to disarm the person.\n\n20 percent of the people who had a gun when they were killed were not threatening anyone.\n\nLaw enforcement training spends seven times more hours training officers on the use of firearms than on how to de-escalate situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, only 12 officers were charged with a crime after killing 1,129 citizens they were sworn to protect and serve.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["riots", "panther", "wanted", "njobu", "history", "black", "killmonger", "revisionist", "help", "cant", "tchalla", "know", "folks"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

A mix of pick-up trucks and sedans flying the Confederate Battle Flag began to trickle in. In a few minutes, the manager of the Walmart, flanked by multiple police officers, would ask them to leave. (\u201cIt\u2019s private property,\u201d he\u2019d say.) But at 10:30 am, a group of about 15 Dixie Freedom Riders were still huddled in a circle, puffing on cigarettes and preparing to drive a few miles north to Memphis, where they would protest what they considered the illegal removal of two Confederate monuments.\n\nLast month, the Memphis city council voted in favor of transferring ownership of two public parks to a recently formed non-profit organization called Greenspace, Inc, who bought them for $1,000 each. Within hours of the vote on December 20, the city had removed statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and Confederate general (and early Ku Klux Klan member) Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, a Facebook group calling itself Confederate 901 put out a call for protesters to meet in Memphis on January 6. But after missing the city\u2019s deadline to apply for a protest permit, Confederate 901 decided instead to caravan through Memphis and display Confederate flags from their vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring the African-American community and the white community\u2014you know, all communities together as one,\u201d said Confederate supporter Renee Land as she waited in the Walmart parking lot Saturday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our history removed. If you\u2019re going to remove that statue, then let\u2019s just go all over entire United States to remove every statue we have.\u201d\n\nBilly Sessions, a Confederate activist and an organizer of the Memphis protest, also disavowed any association with white nationalist groups.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Confederacy, the history has been twisted on that, but we\u2019re all Southerners,\u201d Sessions said later. \u201cNo matter what color you are, we\u2019re all Southerners. It\u2019s not about racism. It might have been about racism hundreds of years ago when the slave ships come across the Atlantic, but it\u2019s not anymore. The white supremacists have hijacked the Confederate flag and it has been seen as a symbol of hate, but it never intentionally was.\u201d\n\n\n\nBilly Roper of The Shield Wall Network, who also showed up in Memphis that day, has a different view. Roper is a self-proclaimed white nationalist who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as \u201cthe uncensored voice of violent neo-Nazism.\u201d Roper is known for his unabashed use of racist, anti-Semitic language and violent rhetoric, at times suggesting that genocide and eugenics should be considered as potential tools to create an all-white ethno-state within the borders of United States. \u201cEthnic cleansing is no new concept,\u201d he said during the Memphis protest. \u201cIt\u2019s always been human nature.\u201d\n\nThe way he saw it, the Shield Wall Network was here to nudge the Confederate activists in the right direction. \u201cMy job is to be as extreme as I can be legally,\u201d he said. \u201cMy radical flank works to make Confederate 901 more radical and extreme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point during the day, Billy Roper and a group of about a dozen supporters managed to post up just outside of Health Sciences Park, formerly known as Forrest Park. Once there, they unfurled a banner: \u201cDiversity = White Genocide.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 10 am on Saturday, it was clear that the City of Memphis had no intention of turning this protest into another Charlottesville. A quarter-mile perimeter was established around the park with various checkpoints that included metal detectors and an extensive police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe violence some community members feared never materialized as counter-protesters from Take \u2018Em Down 901, the NAACP, and other city and civic leaders urged residents not to engage, instead calling for a day of community service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTami Sawyer, founder of Take \u2018Em Down 901 and political planning chair of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP, posted a message to Facebook on Friday evening: \u201cWhile some will choose to ride around and gather in the name of hatred and white supremacy, we are calling for all Memphis to \u2018show up!\u2019 But don\u2019t show up by protesting, counter protesters. Show up by taking this opportunity to show the world that we work together to serve our community.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday morning the hashtag #SHOWUPMEMPHIS began to circulate on social media. Sawyer said she drew inspiration from the efforts of Take \u2018Em Down NOLA in New Orleans where the city saw the removal of three confederate monuments in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been on the front lines for three or four years and saw no change,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cI was encouraged to think of a small change that might be able to happen in the short term and I immediately focused on the monuments.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 3 pm on Saturday, only a small pocket of anti-racist activists had come and gone. Neither the protesters nor the counter-protesters had the opportunity to lay eyes on one another. The Confederate 901 caravan never drove into the city, opting only to make a continuous loop around the I-240 for two hours before stopping at a rally point to disband outside of the city.\n\n\u201cWe did it and it was peaceful,\u201d said Billy Sessions as he sat back in his chair, exhausted and dazed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack at a smoky hotel room in Arkansas a few minutes outside Memphis, Sessions, along with members of \u201cpatriot\u201d organizations Hiwaymen, the Carolina Defenders, and the leadership of Confederate 901, shared stories over beer.\n\nBut the protesters couldn\u2019t completely relax. They\u2019d received a number of threats on social media during the day, they said. A Springfield XD handgun sat on the nightstand, a remnant of the tension earlier that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe night that the statues came down, I was angry,\u201d said George, a Confederate 901 organizer, who didn\u2019t want to give his last name. \u201cI\u2019m a real big history guy and a big fan of Nathan Bedford Forrest. I\u2019ve even been up there to clean the statue and I\u2019ve put flowers on his grave for the past four or five years. I have a great respect for him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know how inner-city Memphis is,\u201d added James Del Brock, co-founder of the Hiwaymen. \u201cI\u2019ve drove through a lot of it. I\u2019ve drove through it with my motorcycle and battle flag. I\u2019ve always wanted to know, because I\u2019m a white person, how to reach into the inner city without getting shot.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they sipped their beers, the protesters signed a Confederate flag. The founder of the Carolina Defenders, who offered his first name, Tom, made a point to note that the signatures were in commemoration, not desecration.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit back and watch it anymore,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThere\u2019s a point where every American has to stand up and say, \u2018Look, our kids aren\u2019t going to have a future or anything to look forward to if the constitution keeps getting trashed the way it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, though, the mood was hopeful. A man who would only identify himself as Phillip and the founder of Confederate 901 says the group is seeking 501c3 status. They recently received a $10,000 donation from a single donor. \u201cThe money is coming in,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nThis feature is part of Splinter\u2019s project to recruit local, embedded reporters, essayists, and photographers across the country.

That year\u2019s was the first election in which the city\u2019s black men could participate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Philadelphia magazine, Catto was shot twice in the back by a white man after sending teachers and students at his school home early that day, lest they encounter any violence.

Garland, Pearin D. Holt, Bryn M.

Dwight Pettit, an attorney for the family, told the Sun, \u201cAfter some investigation, we decided that there were two basic reasons for Mr. Boyd\u2019s death: one, the beating that he incurred, and two, the medical treatment that he received.\u201d\n\nPettit noted that Boyd was the one who called for help, and added, \u201cThe irony about this case is that he was not in any way violent.\u201d The attorney also said that Boyd wasn\u2019t doing anything that warranted a violent response.\n\nOriginally, police said it was Styron who called 911 at around 3 a.m. on Sept. 18, but Boyd was later identified as the caller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen police arrived, they said that Boyd was sweating profusely and \u201cappeared to be consumed and paranoid.\u201d Styron told the responding officers that Boyd had been drinking, smoking marijuana and \u201cacting crazy.\u201d The officers claimed that their attempts to talk to Boyd were met with screams, and that instead of complying with their orders, he attempted to get into police cars.\n\nThe lawsuit denies claims that Boyd was agitated or violent toward police officers.

Other evidence, including shell casings, witness statements and forensic analysis, indicated that Rialmo was apparently farther away from LeGrier when he fired than he initially said he was.\n\nAccording to the Tribune, LeGrier fell in the vestibule of the apartment building. Rialmo said that he fired from the building\u2019s front porch. However, it has since been determined that it was more likely that Rialmo fired from between the bottom of the porch and the sidewalk outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u201creasonable officer,\u201d the board concluded, would have had no reason to believe that he was in danger of death or serious injury.\n\nIt was not immediately made public what recommendations for punishment disciplinary authorities made, but the Tribune notes that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability usually recommends termination for officers involved in unjustified shootings. After that, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson will have three months to decide what form of discipline, if any, he will take.\n\nRialmo\u2019s attorney, of course, is paid to argue for his client, and he claimed that the agency\u2019s ruling cast the evidence in a misleading light, pointing out that LeGrier appeared to be suffering from a mental health crisis during the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI challenge anybody not to feel that their life was in danger in such a situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political decision, not one based on the evidence. ...

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now.

In the episode \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d which employs the same format as Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d episode, the anthology within an anthology gives us brief tours into the horrors of technological advancements, culminating with one larger story arc\u2014that of Clayton, a black man whose virtual conscience is ceaselessly tortured in a vile, sadistic museum attraction.\n\n\n\nThe man to blame for this repulsive amusement park is the museum\u2019s proprietor, Rolo Haynes, who approaches Clayton Leigh while he is on death row for an alleged murder. Instead of looking into DNA evidence to clear Clayton\u2019s name as he is asked to do, Rolo instead convinces Clayton to sign over the rights to his post-death consciousness. When Clayton\u2019s pardon falls through due, in part, to negligence on Rolo\u2019s end, Clayton is given the electric chair. However, his signed agreement allows Rolo to reincarnate Clayton as a fully conscious hologram, and unbeknownst to Clayton or his family, Rolo has insidious intentions\u2014to imprison Clayton\u2019s reborn self in a museum exhibit.\n\nYou see, Clayton 2.0 isn\u2019t your typical hologram but instead a living, breathing electronic copy of Clayton that is conscious and can feel pain. Rolo uses this as a vehicle for profit, allowing museum visitors to electrically shock Clayton as a form of amusement, while Clayton bears the full and very real agony of electrocution. This morbid attraction, bundled with its equally morbid souvenir, a key chain that replays Clayton\u2019s tortured shrieks, is described by the museum\u2019s curator as a \u201cconscious sentient snapshot of Clayton ... perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain. Stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony. Always on. Always suffering.\u201d\n\nThis quote and depiction, in many ways, illustrates America\u2019s historical obsession with black pain and its commodification for profit.\n\nSlavery is the glaring beginning of this horrific legacy as it forcibly turned black people into things that could be purchased, exploited for labor, brutalized and raped. Yet history does not stop there. Human zoos, which put black and brown bodies on display for zoo patrons to laugh and jeer at, were prominent throughout the 1800s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, lynching postcards were extremely popular items in the United States. These postcards displayed the gruesome murders of thousands of black people who were lynched over the course of a century and were bought, sold and sent as greetings between white families and friends.\n\nIn minstrelsy, white men donned blackface to spout false and harmful portrayals of black men and women.\n\nAll of these atrocities were businesses that turned black pain into capitalistic gain. But what happens when the commodity is a byproduct of pain? That is, to obtain the end product, pain must be inflicted. For the museum visitors to obtain their key chain trinket of Clayton, they must electrocute him. Similarly, goods such as the aforementioned lynching postcards and human zoos existed because they were able to collect a \u201cconscious sentient snapshot\u201d of black pain. Always on. Always suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday these \u201csnapshots\u201d take the form of enterprises like the rap industry, in which artists recount trauma, suicidal thoughts and drug addiction while listeners sing along, or museums where people line up to pay to get a glimpse at the bloody slab of concrete where Martin Luther King Jr. took his last breath, or hashtag T-shirt companies whose sales literally depend on continued fatal encounters between black individuals and police officers. As James Allen expressed, \u201cIn America, everything is for sale, even national shame.\u201d\n\n\n\nChance the Rapper often speaks of the summer being a time of death in his community, because many are murdered during the hot months in Chicago. Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s \u201cXO Tour Llif3,\u201d Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cu,\u201d Geto Boy\u2019s \u201cMind Playing Tricks on Me,\u201d Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cSuicidal Thoughts,\u201d Nas\u2019 \u201cDrunk by Myself,\u201d 2Pac\u2019s \u201cThug Mansion\u201d and Vic Mensa\u2019s \u201cThere\u2019s a Lot Going On\u201d all detail their deadly depression, thoughts of death by suicide and even suicide attempts. Hip-hop\u2019s lyricized accounts of poverty, addiction, violence and mental illness are purchased\u2014only to be blared through the speakers of middle-class white teenagers\u2019 cars.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack narratives aren\u2019t immune to hijacking, either. In film and television, our stories are told by white directors and producers for their glory and benefit\u2014as exemplified by the whiteness of the Oscars, Golden Globes and Emmys.\n\nThe media, in its \u201cheroic\u201d endeavors to report, builds its news reels, entertainment pieces and empire on the constant broadcasting of black pain for clicks and views.\n\nHell, our movements aren\u2019t even safe. Depictions of activism are used for commercials to sell Pepsi, a company whose CEO served on Donald Trump\u2019s Business Council, and social-action movements are co-opted by companies like Google and Microsoft, who made large contributions to Trump\u2019s campaign. These gestures are performative and utilized to maintain sales, influence and power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis continued packaging and sale of black struggle is dangerous for it numbs the consumer to black pain, since they are not affected by it but are merely enjoyers of its fruits.\n\nThis numbing bolsters the normalization of black suffering, which, in turn, perpetuates a fallacy that black individuals have an inherent high pain tolerance\u2014and therefore are a) undeserving of empathy and b) immune to the atrocities inflicted upon them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the same ridiculous notion that leads white physicians to withhold pain medication from black individuals under the falsehood that black people experience less pain than white people.\n\nIn other cases, it can create the artifice that black people are superhuman, which is evident in Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201csuperpredator\u201d comment as well as police officers\u2019 perceived need to use extreme force against unarmed black men out of a supposed fear for their lives. Then-Police Officer Darren Wilson displayed this type of thinking in his recount of the death of Mike Brown, whom he described as seemingly impervious to bullets.\n\nA worse scenario of the normalization of black pain manifests the normalization of black death, which is why videos of vicious killings like those of Sam Dubose and Philando Castile can go viral, being liked, shared and streamed millions of times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the cycle of the commodification of black pain, we become desensitized to black suffering in every form, even death.\n\n\n\n\u201cBlack Museum\u201d highlights some very important things about this disgusting cycle: the participants.\n\nIn \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d like in the real world, it is easy to blame the person who created the museum, but he or she is only half of the equation. It was Rolo who imprisoned Clayton, but it was the museum visitors who electrocuted him. It was the seemingly normal white tourists, families and children who pulled that lever, sending electric volts into Clayton\u2019s body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like it was the seemingly normal white families and children who turned lynchings into entertainment events, visited human zoos to gawk at Africans, and went to see minstrel shows.\n\nIt is easy to blame neo-Nazis, white supremacists and Trump for this roller coaster of an administration they\u2019ve built, but if many white folks, even the most benevolent, well-meaning white liberals, look in the mirror, they\u2019ll find that it is they who are holding the money to pay to get on the ride. And just like in the conclusion of Black Mirror: \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d they\u2019ll find that when one gets too comfortable participating in the act of black torture\u2014it rarely ends well.\n\n", "keywords": ["clayton", "death", "mirror", "pain", "claytons", "conscious", "zoos", "white", "history", "reckons", "black", "americas", "commodifying", "rolo", "museum"], "polarity": -0.010777253049980319, "subjectivity": 0.4535832349468708},

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn.

Pence\u2019s snubbing of black people happened on the same day President Donald Trump talked as if Frederick Douglass, abolitionist, writer and civil rights leader, were still alive (he died in 1895). Later in the month, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said that HBCUs were \u201cpioneers\u201d of \u201cschool choice\u201d (colleges were segregated).\n\n\n\nIt was a sign of things to come.\n\n\n\nBy Pence\u2019s standard, Trump made black history in his first year as president by waging an assault on voting rights through his now-defunct voting-fraud commission, calling white supremacists \u201cfine people\u201d after the Charlottesville, Va., march and, more recently, disparaging Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should all be appalled at the administration\u2019s ignorance around race, but we should be not surprised. Racism is taught. And when white history is the standard, when history is told from the point of view of white people, you might well believe, as failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore does, that slavery was good for black people.\n\n\n\nThe flagrant ignorance and blatant racism of the Trump administration makes clearer what black celebrities such as Morgan Freeman and Stacey Dash mean (or so we hope) when they say, \u201cI don\u2019t want Black History Month.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that black history is needed all year long. But white history as we know it can no longer be the standard in a multicultural society, which is supposed to maximize the potential of all its members.\n\n\n\nThe late, great historian Carter G. Woodson started Negro History Week in 1926 with hopes that black people would be proud of their heritage and that mainstream America would recognize the contributions of its black residents. While millions of students across the country now study the influences of black people and culture in what has evolved into Black History Month, Trump proves regularly that Woodson\u2019s ultimate goal of integrating black history into our core curricula fell far short of national acceptance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe danger in relegating black history to a month is that it becomes horribly contained to a month. Ask your child, colleague or friend to say a few brief words about Woodson, sing the first few lines of \u201cthe black national anthem\u201d or identify five African countries during the rest of the months and there\u2019s a strong possibility that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re talking to a version of Trump.\n\nBlack contributions to society are not being recognized in the pantheon of American history. Worse, this lack of recognition is reflected in national policy, racial inequities in compensation and the discounting of black leadership. Unequal pay is a blatant, empirical sign of a devaluation of worth.\n\n\n\nYou obviously can\u2019t blame the devaluation of black people on Black History Month. As a young person, I remember learning about renowned surgeon Ben Carson at a BLM event and how he became the first to successfully separate twins at the head. I listened to Carson with admiration and pride at another such event when he narrated, with great aplomb, the exact stops along the neural pathway from a touch of the finger to the brain and back again. It\u2019s a shtick I would hear many times, with the same reaction.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Carson, as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, referred to slaves as \u201cimmigrants\u201d last year during a departmental junket with employees, he proved that there\u2019s nothing wrong with BLM. Carson, too, could not detach the white-centric history he learned in school from his own brain.\n\n\n\nNo wonder, when he probably also studied those whitewashed stories of Christopher Columbus \u201cdiscovering\u201d America (no matter the millions of Native Americans already living here), which are buttressed by tales of how the Pilgrims supposedly sat down with the Indians for a delightful supper (already part of their harvest tradition).\n\nWhen slavery is covered in history class, the teaching of black benign servitude too often goes along with ideas that the Ku Klux Klan is a Christian organization exhibiting principles like loving thy neighbor. We have statues of Confederate heroes\u2014i.e., racist traitors\u2014littered throughout the U.S., particularly in the South. And of course, Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe misrepresenting of colonization, slavery and racists is behind the racism and ignorance of Trump and people like him, not Black History Month.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m indebted to the people, places and traditions I\u2019ve been introduced to in February. I have received numerous invitations to speak at BLM events, and I will continue to highlight black accomplishments in my columns during February. Calling for mainstream inclusion isn\u2019t a charge to end BLM. In fact, we can use it to introduce more recent history and fresh faces.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if there is a book by a black author that you must read this month, take in Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, by Ibram X. Kendi, winner of the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction. Kendi\u2019s book provides a thorough reading of U.S. history from the perspective of black people. He moves Woodson\u2019s legacy forward, along with those of other notable historians who are still alive, such as James D. Anderson, Robin D.G. Kelley, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Blair L.M. Kelley and Paula Giddings. There are people who continue to write outside of white standards, to our collective benefit. But to reap the social fruits of their labor, we must remove the standard of white-centric history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting to a place where we can make history more inclusive is not easy. In fact, it\u2019s a thoroughly radical endeavor that first requires society to acknowledge that history is not an impartial narration of events as they occurred. It is, rather, the story as told by the people who are telling it. Retelling our history requires acknowledging that the American identity is rooted in a false narrative that makes the exhortation to \u201cMake America great again\u201d an oxymoron (for the people who were brought here as slaves, it was never all that great to begin with).\n\n\n\nMany multicultural-education advocates have promoted curricula that expand the perspectives in American history. The pushback to the ethnic-studies and multicultural-education movements is about protecting white history. University faculty have much more leeway as to their text selection, but people of color are severely underrepresented in the full-time teaching ranks. And core undergraduate curriculums are guarded by traditions, professional (read: white) standards and faculty who were trained in accordance with them.\n\n\n\nRemoving racist history books will be harder than shuttling Confederate monuments to the backs of museums. Neither important act is about erasing history\u2014it\u2019s about making it. Woodson wanted to see black history infused into American history because they\u2019re one and the same. But he also wanted the idolatry of whiteness removed from America\u2019s sight.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["slavery", "standard", "single", "white", "history", "national", "great", "black", "trump", "shouldnt", "racist", "cant", "relegated", "month"], "polarity": 0.04301038843721771, "subjectivity": 0.38613803766242794},

That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["mother", "situation", "pain", "right", "mothers", "rest", "lives", "dormeus", "theres", "wont", "hes", "gaines", "speaks", "korryn", "child", "family", "baltimore"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

After a Chicago police officer took the life of Quintonio LeGrier, 19, nearly two years ago, the city\u2019s attorneys are now looking to sue his family. Their claim? That LeGrier was responsible for the death of an innocent bystander whom the cop also killed.\n\nAs the Chicago Tribune reports, the city\u2019s proposed lawsuit blames LeGrier for the death of bystander Bettie Jones, blaming him for \u201cnegligent acts and/or omissions.\u201d Those include failing to follow police commands, advancing on officers, swinging a baseball bat at police and failing \u201cto take prescribed medication to control his mental illness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a rare and exceptionally heinous step for a city to take, and one clearly aimed at shifting blame for Jones\u2019 death to LeGrier.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, this is actually the second lawsuit filed against the LeGrier family following the 2015 shooting. The officer who killed LeGrier, Robert Rialmo, filed suits in 2016 against both the Chicago Police Department (he claims he wasn\u2019t trained adequately) and LeGrier\u2019s estate. Rialmo blames the teen for the shooting and says he has suffered emotional trauma.\n\nLet\u2019s play that back one more time.\n\nThe cop who killed a teen is suing that teen\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d (though the family has no assets) because the cop suffered emotionally after killing the boy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Jones\u2019 and LeGrier\u2019s survivors have filed suits against the city for the death of their loved ones.\n\nLeGrier and Jones were shot in the early-morning hours the day after Christmas in 2015. Rialmo and another officer responded to a 911 call about a domestic disturbance in the city\u2019s West Side. LeGrier was staying there with his father, Antonio, who called 911 saying that his son was threatening him and banging on his bedroom door with a baseball bat. Later, NBC Chicago revealed that LeGrier had called 911 three times before his father called.\n\n\n\nLeGrier, a student at Northern Illinois University at the time, reportedly had mental health issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones, LeGrier\u2019s downstairs neighbor, answered the door and directed Rialmo and his partner to the second-floor apartment where LeGrier lived.\n\nFrom the Chicago Tribune:\n\nLeGrier then came down the stairs with a baseball bat, according to an analysis released in February by State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s office, which declined to bring charges against Rialmo in the incident. The police started to back up onto the front landing as the teen came toward them with the bat raised over his head, prosecutors wrote. As Rialmo backed down the stairs, he fired, according to prosecutors. He shot eight times, hitting LeGrier six times. Jones had been standing behind him and was shot once in the chest, prosecutors wrote. Rialmo recently stipulated in court that he knew Jones was standing close by when he fired, though [his attorney] said the officer was nonetheless justified in firing in self-defense. Rialmo has said he feared for his life after LeGrier swung the bat at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Tribune, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates Chicago Police Department shootings, has yet to decide whether LeGrier\u2019s shooting was justified under CPD policy.\n\nRead more at the Chicago Tribune.", "keywords": ["sue", "officer", "death", "tribune", "family", "wants", "jones", "bat", "city", "teen", "legrier", "legriers", "cops", "black", "rialmo", "chicago", "shot"], "polarity": 0.07953216374269005, "subjectivity": 0.3375730994152047},

Instead, as their shifts were about to end and heavy rain poured down around them, the two men were crushed to death in the barrel of a faulty garbage truck.\n\nTheir deaths sparked a revolution that would forever change the trajectory of the civil rights movement.

I have managed to uncover bits and pieces of information here and there, but some are contradictory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenry Ransom may have escaped from the plantation of Joseph Fox of Westmoreland County, Va. My attempts at gathering more information on Joseph Fox have been unsuccessful so far apart from one vague census record. Recently, however, I searched the Maryland State Archives and found the name of Hannah Ransom of Calvert County listed as a refugee. Is this my ancestor? I suspect she may be related to me because I also heard that Henry Ransom arrived in Trinidad with \u201cAnna\u201d Ransom and three children. Please help me learn more about them. \u2014Korinne Louison\n\nAs your question and others we have answered in previous columns illustrate, numerous enslaved people resisted their servitude. While our research did not turn up a definitive link between Henry Ransom and Hannah Ransom, or Henry and Joseph Fox, we found some leads that you should follow. We also noticed that the surname \u201cRansom\u201d in Maryland and Virginia has a striking association with resistance to slavery.\n\nThe War of 1812 Provides Freedom for Some\n\nIn fighting on the side of the British during the War of 1812 and settling in the English Caribbean colony of Trinidad in 1814, your Henry Ransom apparently followed a similar path to that of Ezekiel Loney, an escaped Virginia slave whose background we traced in the column \u201cMy \u2018Merikin\u2019 Ancestor Escaped Slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs mentioned, during that war, the British military invited escaped American slaves from mainly coastal Virginia, Maryland and Georgia to fight on their side in exchange for freedom and land in the West Indies. Those who immigrated to Trinidad after their service, as well as their families, were called \u201cMerikins.\u201d\n\nAs you mentioned, Hannah Ransom of Calvert County, Md., is listed as a \u201cWar of 1812 Refugee\u201d on a website of the Maryland State Archives. Given the relative closeness of Westmoreland County, Va., and Calvert County, Md., it\u2019s plausible that she is your Anna Ransom. Unfortunately, the website is not very clear on what records were used to compile this list or where you might find more information. You could contact the Maryland Historical Society to inquire about Hannah Ransom to see if it has any more information that could connect her to a former slave owner, to Henry Ransom or to the emigr\u00e9s.\n\nAn Earlier Attempt to Escape Bondage\n\nWhile researching this, we came across information about a widely documented slave insurrection associated with the surname \u201cRansom\u201d more than 70 years before the War of 1812. The Maryland State Archives has a list of people who were \u201cgibbeted\u201d for crimes between 1723 and 1775, including a \u201cNegro Jack Ransom\u201d in 1740 for \u201cinsurrection\u201d in Prince George\u2019s County (near Hannah Ransom\u2019s Calvert County). Gibbeting refers to a practice of hanging the body of an executed criminal on display to deter others from committing the same crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting for the William and Mary Quarterly in April 1978, historian Allan Kulikoff described the events that led to Jack Ransom\u2019s execution:\n\nThe Negroes spent eight months in 1739 planning to seize their freedom by killing their masters and other white families in the neighborhood. Their leader, Jack Ransom, was probably a native [African American], but most of the conspirators were [born] Africans, for it is reported that the planning was done by the slaves in \u201ctheir country language.\u201d The revolt was postponed several times and finally the white authorities got wind of it. Stephen Boardley, an Annapolis lawyer, reported that whites believed that 200 slaves planned to kill all of the white men, marry the white women, and then unite both shores of Maryland under their control.\n\nWith the alleged plot foiled, Jack was arrested, tried and executed for conspiracy to raise an insurrection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a chart compiled by the Maryland State Archives and based on court records, Jack Ransom was charged with his crime on Dec. 1, 1739, convicted in March of 1739-40 and executed on April 4, 1740. He had been enslaved by Jane Brooke (pdf).\n\nA more detailed description of the Jack Ransom story on the Brandywine, Md., website describes Jack Ransom as an intelligent man between the ages of 40 and 50. Among the other four slaves indicted was a \u201cGeorge,\u201d who was also owned by Brooke. Unlike Jack, George was acquitted. This account also provides more details about Jane Brooke; her husband, Clement Brooke Sr., who had died two years prior to the incident; and the Poplar Neck tobacco plantation she owned, which had at least seven slaves and which was in the Brooke family from 1671 until 1870.\n\nIt seems a strong possibility that the Clement Brooke residing at Prince George\u2019s County, Md., in 1790 was a descendant. You might benefit from examining the papers for this family to see if they have a connection to Joseph Fox or if there is a bill of sale between the two families that could connect your Ransom family to Jack Ransom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHad Henry Ransom Escaped Fox\u2019s Plantation?\n\nAs for Joseph Fox, he was residing at Westmoreland, Va., in 1820, at which time he had 28 slaves recorded in his household. Ten years prior, in 1810, he was also recorded at Westmoreland County, Va., with 24 slaves recorded in his household. It would be between these two dates that your Henry Ransom escaped and joined the British in 1814.\n\nThese records do not provide many clues about your relatives, since the recording of enslaved persons in both enumeration did not include their names (which was the practice until the end of slavery). The number of slaves in the household increased from 1810 to 1820, and you know that at least your ancestor escaped in between these years, so it is possible that Joseph Fox was purchasing slaves during that decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocating records for any of those whom Joseph Fox enslaved might provide clues about your ancestors. However, you are not going to find any census records earlier than 1810 for Westmoreland County because fires destroyed the records from 1790 to 1800. Gaining a better understanding of what records are available for Westmoreland County may help you determine where to look for more information.\n\nWe located a marriage record for Joseph Fox and Mary Hipkins at Westmoreland County, Va., on April 5, 1788. It is always a good idea to note the women entering a family, since slaves were often brought into estates through marriage, as part of a woman\u2019s dowry or by inheritance.\n\nGenealogies of Virginia Families notes that the Joseph Fox who married Mary Hipkins was the son of Joseph and Anjalettah (Wroe) Fox. The younger Joseph Fox was justice of the peace in 1798 and was elected clerk of Westmoreland in 1799, a position he held until his death in 1823. This also states that Joseph Fox Sr. died in 1804 and the will was proved Oct. 22, 1804, at Westmoreland, Va. The probate record for Joseph Fox Sr. may be the one you will want to focus on, since he may have left slaves to his son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to this source, Joseph Fox Sr. also had six daughters. You may also want to investigate records for the estates of his daughters\u2019 husbands because it is possible that your Henry Ransom was owned by someone else in the family but the connection to a Joseph Fox was still remembered.\n\nThe Family History Library has probate records for Westmoreland County available on microfilm that you could view at your local Family History Center. It also has digitized copies of some land and probate records, but they, too, must be viewed within a Family History Center. You could also contact the county clerk or other relevant repositories for the county directly to see if you could obtain a copy of Joseph Fox Sr.\u2019s probate record or other records relating to the Fox family and their estates.\n\nWhere Did the \u201cRansom\u201d Name Come From?\n\nFinally, determining where your ancestors got the \u201cRansom\u201d surname may lead you to more information. In 1810, there were a few slave owners with the surname \u201cRansom\u201d residing in Virginia. In Buckingham County, Va., William Ransom owned 15 slaves, and recorded directly under him was Elizabeth Ransom with 18 slaves. Perhaps there is a bill of sale in records for these individuals that could prove a connection to Joseph Fox and your Ransom ancestors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul Heinegg has an article on free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware about a family with the \u201cRansom\u201d surname who were free in North Carolina in the mid-18th century. Although we found no slave owners with the surname \u201cRansom\u201d in North Carolina in 1810, you may still want to investigate this free black family to see if you can make a connection to yours. Heinegg has also abstracted tax lists that you may also want to search for the surname.\n\nFinally, searching records linked to Trinidad may turn up leads. There are some collections at the National Archives of Trinidad and Tobago that might be helpful, such as the Land Ownership Records and Assessment. The U.K. National Archives also have collections of Trinidad correspondence and maps from this era that may include information on Colonial Marine settlement.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and founding director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.

Gaines\u2019 mother and father were awarded $307,000 and $300,000, respectively, and $300,000 was awarded to the Gaines estate.

The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun?

A (former) cop is finally going to prison over the shooting death of an unarmed black man.\n\nMichael Slager, a former North Charleston, S.C., police officer, has been sentenced to 19-24 years in prison for the 2015 death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black motorist whom Slager shot in the back during a routine traffic stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the ruling delivered today, U.S. District Judge David Norton found that Slager had committed second-degree murder and obstruction of justice. Norton\u2019s decision was delivered after Slager pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights offense. As ABC News reports, the guilty plea effectively \u201cend[ed] the federal case against him and also resolv[ed] the state charges that were pending after the mistrial.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time Slager has stood trial for Scott\u2019s death. Last year, Slager evaded justice when the former North Charleston cop\u2019s trial ended in a mistrial.\n\nAs The Root reported earlier, the 36-year-old Slager could have been dealt a life sentence in addition to a $250,000 fine for using excessive force during the routine traffic stop. While the 19- to 24-year sentence stops well short of that, the very fact of the prison sentence is anomalous: Officers are rarely sent to prison for fatal shootings.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Slager\u2019s lawyers attempted to use Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 faulty memory to excuse Slager\u2019s erratic, inconsistent and untrue recollection of what happened in the moments leading up to Scott\u2019s death.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

Our fairer-skinned, \u201cMAGA\u201d compatriots who order dry whole wheat toast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is d\u2014all of the above.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a vast, paranoid conspiracy theory, I point you in the direction of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union reveal that for years, the Boston Police Department has been using a sophisticated social media monitoring program to spy on the social media posts of Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims and even high school students in the area, according to Privacy SOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., major cities across the country began creating special intelligence units dedicated to preventing acts of terrorism. These interdepartmental units are basically local versions of the FBI, employing the same kinds of surveillance techniques. They are ostensibly local spy agencies.\n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit monitored text messages from Black Lives Matter members. Baltimore\u2019s version used high-definition cameras attached to planes flying above the city 24 hours a day to monitor activists after the uprising over Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. But maybe none were as sophisticated as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BPD used a program called Geofeedia that monitored Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms used by any activists with more than a pinch of melanin in their skin. It collected information about political beliefs, social activism, religious activities and regular conversations that had no importance related to criminal activity. It tagged anyone who spoke out against law enforcement.\n\nWhat it did not do is solve a single crime.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make this clear: Geofeedia and the Boston Police Department were not targeting criminal suspects. They were not trying to solve or prevent crimes. The people they surveilled were not even suspected of any past or future wrongdoing. They were just regular black people. They were just ordinary Muslim citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a man named Tito Jackson, for instance. In November 2014, Jackson wrote a Facebook post about being thankful. He talked about helping the citizens of his community pass out turkeys in the days prior to Thanksgiving. He told people to be thankful that they weren\u2019t homeless. But Jackson made a grave mistake in his Facebook post. He mentioned the words \u201cFerguson\u201d and \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d He was now under surveillance.\n\nJackson is not a criminal. Most people wouldn\u2019t even consider him radical. But he was black, which made him a target of the Boston police. There is one more thing that is important to know about Jackson and his targeting:\n\nHe was also a Boston city councilman.\n\nIn March 2016, over 1,000 students walked out of Boston public schools to protest budget cuts. Forty-two percent of students in the Boston Public Schools district are Latinx and 35 percent are black. Only 14 percent are white. Of course, Geofeedia was watching them. The software cataloged the students\u2019 social media communication. As intricately detailed as the program seemed to be, it did not differentiate between harmless private conversation and serious threats. Maybe because \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t care. Or perhaps stopping violence was never the purpose of the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program also tracked Muslims who used everyday terms in regular communications. Two of the most frequent \u201ctrigger words\u201d that popped up alerts in the system were \u201cummah\u201d\u2014 which roughly translates to \u201ccommunity\u201d in Arabic\u2014and \u201cMuslim Lives Matter\u201d because ... of course. The Islamophobic algorithm resulted in almost every religious service and charitable activity in Boston\u2019s Muslim community being spied on, including events like a Muslims Against Hunger fundraiser.\n\nSupposedly a crime-fighting tool, Geofeedia was used by the BRIC as a virtual, online version of stop and frisk. There is no evidence that the data resulted in a single arrest. (Although, to be fair, a number of teenagers were arrested for recklessly driving their bicycles. Some people suspect it was because the hashtag #BikeLife was a trigger word in the software.) Instead, the software targeted individuals based mainly on their political beliefs and religion.\n\nThe BPD no longer uses Geofeedia\u2014not because it was ineffective or because there is no evidence that it ever helped prevent a single incident of violence, but because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram banned its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an isolated occurrence in a single municipality. It is part of the invisible cost of being black or Muslim and speaking above a whisper. Even if you have no nefarious intentions, you will be watched if you are a person of color who uses his or her voice to do ... well ... anything. It is not even about crime prevention, protecting or serving. It is about control. It is about forcing brown mouths to shut the fuck up.\n\nWhether it is giving away food, fighting for education reform or even thanking God, not being white is cause for suspicion in and of itself. The first right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, religion and assembly because, without it, none of the others are possible. If the people entrusted with enforcing those laws are the ones who violate them, then who in this country is really free?\n\nAdvertisement\n\na. White people.\n\nb. Wypipo.\n\nc.

Everyone is talking about how much it has grown, how you can invest 75 cents into bitcoin on Monday, and by Friday you\u2019ll have enough money to qualify for the biggest tax cuts under the Republican Tax Plan for People Who Wear Boat Shoes, Monocles and Patagonia Sweaters (I think that\u2019s the official name).\n\nBut what is bitcoin? Why has bitcoin exploded? And, more important, why has bitcoin become the darling of the white supremacist movement?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root put together this explainer to answer all of your bitcoin-related questions.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency.\n\nThat\u2019s all you got? \u201cBitcoin is a cryptocurrency\u201d? What the hell is a cryptocurrency?\n\nSo you know what a currency is, right?\n\nOf course. It\u2019s money.\n\nOK, well imagine going to the bank, withdrawing all of your money in $1 bills, then writing down all of the serial numbers from each bill. What if there were someone who was willing to sell you things on the internet if you just gave them the serial numbers on your money?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin is essentially a system for storing and exchanging digital units of currency whose \u201cserial numbers\u201d are encrypted, making them anonymous and unhackable. They are held in \u201cwallets\u201d on a decentralized network of computers. It is essentially a PayPal for nerds.\n\nBut I can hold a dollar in my hand. Is bitcoin real?\n\nNot really, but neither is a dollar.\n\nWhat do you mean dollars aren\u2019t real? I can hold a dollar in my hand. I pay my rent with them. Tell Destinee the Diamond Goddess that dollars aren\u2019t real when I make it rain at the strip club.\n\nBefore tuning them out, have you ever heard Hoteps talk about \u201cfiat\u201d money, the Federal Reserve and how it\u2019s all a confidence game? Well, in this case (and probably only in this case), they are correct. In 1971, the U.S. dollar became the first national currency that was not backed by an actual commodity. Instead, the dollar is backed by \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason you aren\u2019t homeless and are still able to receive lap dances is that you, your landlord and Destinee have agreed that dollars are worth something. Bitcoin is the same as the dollar, your checking account information or your credit card numbers. People have agreed that bitcoin is worth something, so it is worth something, although the people at the strip club won\u2019t let you into the champagne room if you try to pay them in bitcoin.\n\nSo why has bitcoin exploded lately?\n\nBecause bitcoin is the SZA of currencies.\n\nWait ... what?\n\nRemember a couple of months ago, when you first heard about this underground singer named SZA? I honestly thought that people were talking about the putrid baconlike substance from the \u201980s called \u201cSizzlean.\u201d No one knew who SZA was or why she hated vowels so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin has been around for quite a few years, just like SZA. Computer-savvy people used cryptocurrency to buy drugs, prostitutes and SZA albums over the internet. But, like SZA, bitcoin only became a superstar when mainstream white people \u201cdiscovered\u201d it. Now bitcoin is more than just a currency, it is a commodity.\n\nInstead of using it to buy things, people trade it based on its perceived value, like oil, Microsoft stock or SZA albums. It is not harder to make a barrel of oil today than it was 20 years ago. Microsoft isn\u2019t selling more software than it was two years ago. Their value increases or decreases based on popularity. SZA isn\u2019t a better singer than she was six months ago, but she is worth a lot more money now. So is bitcoin.\n\nIs that why white supremacists love it so much, because it\u2019s popular?\n\nNot quite.\n\nRemember a few months ago, when internet companies began ousting white supremacist organizations? Well, when it comes to finding loopholes, white people are nothing if not resourceful. Mic reports that white supremacist organizations began using bitcoin to collect donations after they were banned from using sites like PayPal and GoFundMe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the byproducts of cryptocurrency\u2019s exponential growth is that Nazis have made a lot of money from the bitcoin boom. According to Mic, John Bambenek, a cybersecurity researcher, estimates that Andrew Anglin, founder of the Daily Storm, has made $250,000 off of bitcoin. On Oct. 1, the site withdrew $64,353 from its account, the site reports. Some speculate that bitcoin is what Anglin uses to stay on the run and avoid a lawsuit that may bankrupt him and his business.\n\nSo racists like it because it makes them rich?\n\nWhite supremacists like bitcoin because it can fund the movement without the people who contribute being labeled white supremacists. The average, run-of-the-mill racists like it because they can donate without anyone knowing. Bitcoin is essentially a digital Ku Klux Klan hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the \u201calt-right\u201d Richard Spencer gave it his nod of approval.\n\nBy the way\u2014and this is not a joke\u2014can you guess what the first item ever purchased with bitcoin was?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you say cryptocurrency was an underground thing for white people, so I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t seasoning. Crystal meth? A \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat? A Taylor Swift box set?\n\nA pepperoni pizza from Papa Johns.\n\nSeems about right. So, the Nazi thing notwithstanding, should I invest in bitcoin?\n\nI am not a financial adviser, but most economists say you should buy low and sell high, and bitcoin is very high right now. You could jump on the bitcoin bandwagon, but when people realize that they\u2019re paying $1,000 for $5 worth of bitcoin, the market could crash. If history teaches us anything, it\u2019s that Caucasians will overpay for things. We saw it happen with the tech boom, the housing boom and marijuana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou think the marijuana industry is going to crash?\n\nNot as long as Snoop Dogg is alive. But before it became legal, very reliable sources told me that it was easy to convince white guys who wore boat shoes to buy an eighth of weed for $80.\n\nThe point is: Aside from racism and praise-dance performances, nothing lasts forever. All markets eventually self-correct. It is possible to make a lot of money in bitcoin, but it is also possible to lose money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do you know so much about bitcoin? :\n\nWell, aside from ranting about white people on the internet, I\u2019ve actually never taken a course in Caucasianology. I actually have a master\u2019s degree in international business, and most of my professional career was spent in macroeconomics. Studying white people has always been my passion, though.\n\nAlso ... Google.\n\nSo, as a professional in both areas, in which market would you suggest I invest and know it won\u2019t crash?\n\nThere are only two places I know you can put your money and get a guaranteed return:", "keywords": ["sza", "internet", "love", "dollar", "explained", "money", "numbers", "white", "ago", "supremacists", "worth", "bitcoin", "know"], "polarity": 0.13105499162395712, "subjectivity": 0.35590127050471876},

(Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["russian", "weak", "president", "obama", "hawks", "fake", "gop", "look", "making", "trumps", "trump", "russias", "ukraine", "republican", "russia"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

I wore African print, consumed a little more chicken than usual and kept hot sauce in my bag #Swag.\n\n\u201cAdulting\u201d has taught me that definitions vary from person to person, and this can also be said for common sense during this year\u2019s Black History Month. Every February, my idea of celebration involves paying tribute to those who have paved numerous roads and indulging in the greatness that is melanin. For others, this simple concept was hard to grasp and even harder to execute. In 2017, the year of my Lord and Savior, there were still some folks who were out in this world confused about how to properly celebrate Black History Month.\n\nSince I am an altruistic Christian who is always working on my admission into heaven, I feel it is my duty to help the beige on their journey not to embarrass themselves in 2018. This alone will probably secure my seat at Jesus\u2019 table:\n\n1. Remember: Like black lives, spelling matters.\n\nWhen you\u2019re honoring prominent figures in the black community, it is imperative that you spell their names correctly. Your tribute becomes void for even the simplest of mistakes. You end up looking racist or as if you don\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am here to tell you that Google is still a free service and will save you from the embarrassment that will ensue if you post an incorrect name. Hey, wypipo, quick history lesson: W.E.B. Du Bois \u2260 W.E.B DeBois; be better than the Department of Education. The last thing America needs is for you to tap into your inner Betsy DeVos.\n\n2. A picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to celebrate one of the many great acts of black people, it is helpful to put the correct face with the name. If you are honoring a woman who freed herself from slavery, it\u2019s best to use a photo of her and not her alleged descendant Johnny Depp. Your Black History Month post doesn\u2019t hold the same weight when you place someone who is taupe out in front.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe better than 45\u2019s administration, and don\u2019t spread #AlternativeFacts. Don\u2019t be like the Grammys and think we all look alike, and remember that, contrary to Tangerine Mussolini\u2019s beliefs, we do not all know each other. And I promise I will personally find you and slap the unseasoned food out of your mouth if you ever place a piece of fried chicken near any prominent figure in our history.\n\n3. Know the history.\n\nIf you are like Vice President Mike Pence, you probably think that shouting out a white man during Black History Month is cool, but it\u2019s not. I know it\u2019s hard to wrap your mind around the idea that black history started before slavery, and I know it may be difficult to fathom anything having started without white influence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, in all my melanin-filled glory, am here to tell you that we don\u2019t just arbitrarily call it the Motherland. There were kingdoms, inventors, intellectuals and thriving cultures before anyone was forced to leave their countries. We even have an entire museum in Washington, D.C., depicting our history. Take a look\u2014it might change your life and Black History Month display boards. Making your Pinterest boards a reality and neglecting to add melanin doesn\u2019t speed your cause forward; it stops it in its tracks.\n\nAs mentioned, I know a lot of you think we all look alike, but this is one time that you need not make that public mistake. A mistake like confusing Rosa Parks with Harriet Tubman will fill your life with more trouble than you ever intended. No one will think that you wanted Tubman to take a seat to relax from her tireless work of freeing our people; they\u2019ll just think you\u2019re racist.\n\n4. Forget referencing your \u201cblack friend.\u201d\n\nYes, kudos to you for acquiring some diversity in your circle of friends, but this does not warrant a medal and is not something to boast about. You will not become any more relatable to any black person by telling him or her that you have a black friend. It teeters along the lines of racism\u2014actually, it Dougies smooth the hell over the line, and now you\u2019re that fluorescent appropriating person. We can\u2019t all be Adele.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Celebrities are cool, but black folks are more than a famous face.\n\nSure, it\u2019s cool to shout out M.J. (pick one) or talented muva Beyonc\u00e9, but there is more to our history than the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. If you\u2019re an educator, take this opportunity to immerse your classroom in the hidden figures that may be lost to you.\n\nTry a day without using a black invention; it\u2019s hard. If you\u2019re just an average, run-of-the-mill ecru person, read a book and find out how you can be an ally to the cause. You don\u2019t need an Oprah\u2019s Lifeclass lesson on how to be a good person; you just need to let Google be the friend it was placed on this earth to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Know your culinary lane.\n\nYes, our food is amazing\u2014orgasmic, even\u2014but leave the seasoning to the professionals. I know you long to partake in the divine joys of our culture\u2019s food, but this is not your lane. You may come from a people notorious for their allergy to seasoning, so a how-to tutorial on frying chicken may not be your calling or ministry. I promise you, the world will not be a better place with your gluten-free tutorial, and you are not doing any of my ancestors proud. In fact, I think they just rolled over in their graves.\n\nLawry\u2019s and pepper go a long way. And if you\u2019re an owner of a culinary establishment, you may want to shy away from stereotypical advertisements. Yes, I know it seems like a great idea between you and Becky, but trust me, Keisha won\u2019t agree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Say no to blackface.\n\nDon\u2019t be that person who is culturally insensitive and inappropriate. If you have to alter the color of your skin to portray any person or character and it\u2019s not a damn Pok\u00e9mon, you\u2019re wrong. No, seriously; I\u2019m not joking. Don\u2019t let Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s appropriation of an oompa loompa make you feel that face painting to depict a person is OK. In this case, orange is not the new black.\n\n8. #365Black.\n\nYes, these 28 or 29 days are what have been allotted to celebrate black history, but it doesn\u2019t end there. If, on March 1, you find yourself unsure or reverting to your ignorant ways of January, ask yourself if you have made any cultural changes or if you understand the contributions of black people. Furthermore, please note that doing these tributes will not guarantee you a seat at our table. You will not be rewarded or celebrated for doing what you are supposed to be doing in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoving forward, I implore you all to listen with open ears, open minds and closed mouths. If you don\u2019t understand something, ask and be informed. It\u2019s better to get the answer than to live your life in a perpetual state of DeVos. If you plan to celebrate Black History Month in the future, your knowledge needs to extend beyond the current administration\u2019s. You can\u2019t be out here in the world thinking Frederick Douglass and his coiffed hair are still kicking it and fighting for my people\u2019s rights. No, you cannot make him your employee of the month.\n\nFeel free to have secret white meetings and email chains about these helpful tips.

White-owned businesses in the South often refused to service vehicles driven by African Americans. Even stopping to use gas station restrooms was fraught with peril across the Southern United States. In 1956, only three hotels in the entire state of New Hampshire offered accommodations to black travelers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, this was not just a Southern phenomenon. According to the book Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of Racism, by the end of the 1960s, more than 10,000 towns forbade blacks from entering their city limits after dark, including Glendale, Calif., and Warren, Mich. Over half the incorporated towns in Illinois were \u201csundown towns\u201d like Anna, Ill., which expelled its entire black population in 1909 and had the unofficial slogan \u201cAin\u2019t no niggers allowed.\u201d\n\nIn 1937, a mail carrier named Victor Hugo Green published the Negro Motorist Green Book\u2014a guide for New York of places that welcomed black travelers. He relied on information from fellow black postal carriers, and the book became so popular, many referred to it as \u201cthe bible for black travelers.\u201d By the time the last edition of the Green Book was published in 1966-1967, it had expanded from a 15-page guide for New York to 99 pages of information indicating safe harbor for blacks traveling all over America and internationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreated by the South Carolina African American Heritage Commission, the Green Book of South Carolina has been designed for travelers and residents interested in the cultural and historical sites across the state. Similar to a tourism app, it encompasses every county in South Carolina and highlights the rich cultural history of places like Charleston\u2019s slave market, numerous civil rights landmarks and the historic Rosenwald Schools.\n\n\u201cThe development of the mobile guide perfectly aligns with our organization\u2019s mission to identify and promote the preservation of historic sites, structures, buildings and culture of the African-American experience in South Carolina,\u201d said Jannie Harriot, vice chairperson of the commission. (In the interests of full disclosure, Jannie Harriot is related to the writer by motherhood.)\n\nThe South Carolina African American Heritage Commission works to increase the social, political and economic value of South Carolina African-American heritage; encourage and demonstrate respect for all heritages; document and institutionalize African-American heritage as an ongoing goal of preservation; and explore all areas of South Carolina for African-American contributions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the Green Book of South Carolina here.", "keywords": ["painful", "carolina", "south", "tool", "heritage", "african", "travelers", "history", "book", "towns", "guide", "black", "learning", "turns", "green", "mobile", "traveling"], "polarity": 0.04276751893939394, "subjectivity": 0.315909090909091},

Abelove is accused of concealing evidence in the shooting of 37-year-old Edson Thevenin and then lying during the subsequent investigation. He is also accused of repeatedly interfering with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s efforts to investigate the shooting. Thevenin was shot eight times and killed by Troy, N.Y., Police Sgt. Randall French after a traffic stop for suspected drunken driving went awry in April 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn New York, a 2015 executive order by Gov. Andrew Cuomo requires the attorney general to investigate and criminally prosecute any case in which a police officer kills an unarmed civilian. Rather than provide Schneiderman with requested information related to the shooting, Abelove chose to present a truncated version of the case to a grand jury, and French was cleared of any wrongdoing less than a week after the shooting.\n\nAbelove\u2019s actions exemplify the type of behavior that Cuomo\u2019s executive order is meant to prevent.\n\n\u201cAs we allege, District Attorney Abelove\u2019s actions violated the law and undermined a criminal investigation,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cThe governor\u2019s executive order was designed to restore public confidence in our criminal-justice system \u2014 yet the actions we detail today only served to further erode that confidence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrench pulled Thevenin over April 17, 2016, on suspicion of drunken driving. There was a short chase, after which French claimed that Thevenin attempted to run him over. He shot Thevenin through his windshield eight times. Witnesses who testified in front of Schneiderman\u2019s grand jury said that French\u2019s life was not in danger at the time he shot Thevenin.\n\nAbelove is charged with two misdemeanor counts of official misconduct and one count of perjury, which is a class D felony.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

You might even ask, \u201cWhat about 1619, when the first slaves were brought to America, jump-starting white supremacy?\u201d\n\n\n\nMaybe you\u2019re considering 1860, when 11 states decided they\u2019d rather host the bloodiest war in the country\u2019s history than give up chattel slavery. Perhaps you think 1892 is the whitest year ever, when 161 black people were lynched, according to Tuskegee University\u2019s \u201cLynching, Whites and Negroes\u201d (pdf). Even 1989 might stand out in your mind if only because it was the year Taylor Swift was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNope. 2017 was worse.\n\nDespite the trouble and turmoil in all of those years, they pale in comparison with 2017. While the previously mentioned time periods were unquestionably white, they were usually less white than the previous year. Despite one\u2019s opinion on racism in this country, whether it\u2019s because of inevitability, progress or the sheer force of blacks fighting back, white supremacy has steadily lost its toehold in America. It is a foundation that we saw eroding with each revolution around the sun. Whiteness was like LeBron\u2019s hairline: fading but holding on.\n\nBut not this year.\n\nThis year, caucasity returned like Afros and bell-bottom jeans. Just when we thought it was defeated, it burst back into our living rooms, sat down on our sofas and screamed \u201cFuck yo\u2019 couch\u201d to anyone who could hear it.

White women tried to rob black women of the credit for an Alabama election. They swiped the #MeToo movement from a black woman. 2017\u2019s whiteness tried to steal health care from those who couldn\u2019t afford it. It took tax breaks from the rich and gave to the poor. It stole the blame for violence from white supremacists and mass shooters and placed it at the feet of anti-fascists. And Black Lives Matter. And \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d And Chicago\u2019s top gang thugs. And Mexican immigrants. And Muslims. And everyone but white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhiteness is fragile.\n\nIn 2017, whiteness felt oppressed. It said that white people were discriminated against. It carried tiki torches while whining that it will not be replaced. It rallied for the cause in Charlottesville, Va. It cried when it found out it was in trouble. It called everyone else \u201csnowflakes\u201d but melted down when NFL players took a knee. It boo-hooed about white genocide. It reminded its fellow milky martyrs that it was \u201cOK to be white.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more than any other year, whiteness regressed. This country moonwalked backward instead of toward the light. 2017 put us in reverse, and it wasn\u2019t because Americans wanted to go backward. White people did.\n\nAfter millions enjoyed universal health care for the first time, they repealed the mandate for the Affordable Care Act and will eventually make insurance unaffordable again. They stripped away regulations that made the environment safe and kept Wall Street in line. They committed two of the five deadliest mass shootings in recent history and refused to pass any gun legislation.\n\nThey returned to mandatory minimums. They went back to mass incarceration. They took a regressive stance on marijuana. The Ku Klux Klan returned in force. Nazis started walking around proudly. Confederate sympathizers sprang out of nowhere. So did Confederate flags. And swastikas. And hate crimes. And people ranting in Starbucks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 might not be as white as 1860, but 1860 wasn\u2019t as white as 1859. 2017, on the other hand, is whiter than the previous year. And the one before that. And the one before that.\n\nThis was the year of whiteness\u2014not white supremacy, racism or any other euphemism for discrimination or hate. It was that, too. But it was more than that. It was a big, fat rolling back of the hands of time. Even if this country is getting demographically darker, white America is fighting to make it as white as it always was.

As part of those investigations, attorneys for Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, were required to turn over to congressional investigators secret direct messages that were passed back and forth on Twitter between him and WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Atlantic obtained a copy of the messages, and writer Julia Ioffe reported that WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for his cooperation in sharing its work, in contesting the results of the U.S. election and in arranging for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, the first message was sent to Trump Jr. by WikiLeaks at midnight on Sept. 20, 2016\u2014at the height of the presidential campaign\u2014and it read: \u201cA PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch. The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is \u2018putintrump.\u2019 See \u2018About\u2019 for who is behind it.

Thanks.\u201d\n\nThe site was an election-season blog launched by Rob Glaser, founder of RealNetworks and an early employee at Microsoft. It was funded by the Progress for USA Political Action Committee and has since moved to Mother Jones, where it now functions as a new project to report on the Trump-Russia ties and foreign influence in U.S. politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the inquiries about Putin-Trump, WikiLeaks continued to solicit Trump Jr.\u2019s cooperation until at least July 2017 with requests that included asking for Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, urging the Trump campaign on Election Day to reject the results of the election as rigged, and requesting that the then president-elect tell Australia to appoint Assange ambassador to the United States.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., told The Atlantic: \u201cOver the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests. Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks did not respond to The Atlantic\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nOn Monday evening, Assange publicly tweeted that he could not confirm the DMs that The Atlantic reports to have because WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t keep those records, and The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cpresentation is edited.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA little more than an hour later, Trump Jr. tweeted copies of the DMs reported in The Atlantic\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for the frosting on this cake of disbelief, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Byron Tau found this juicy little gem:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears that Trump Jr. colluded, and his daddy (it appears) knew it.\n\nMessy, messy, messy.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to the story. Even after Trump won the election, WikiLeaks continued to reach out to Junior to get him to cooperate with various things, including asking him to let them leak copies of emails between himself and publicist Rob Goldstone, who had set up a meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya\u2014who has connections to Russia\u2019s powerful prosecutor general. The New York Times had broken the story three days prior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump Jr. did not respond to the request from WikiLeaks, but hours later, he leaked the emails himself on his own Twitter feed.\n\nRead more at The Atlantic.", "keywords": ["donald", "deception", "continued", "drama", "jr", "wikileaks", "atlantic", "later", "election", "lies", "documents", "trump", "requests", "pac"], "polarity": 0.05765151515151516, "subjectivity": 0.36085227272727277},

To open the series, we interviewed a descendant of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington. Next, we did a Q&A with the descendants of Ida B. Wells, and last week we spoke to a descendant of W.E.B. Du Bois. Today we close the series with Pauline Copes Johnson, the great-great-grandniece of Harriet Tubman, the famous \u201cconductor\u201d on the Underground Railroad and a scout, spy and nurse during the Civil War. We spoke to Johnson about how she\u2019s upholding Tubman\u2019s legacy and the importance of history.\n\n\n\nIn the darkness of night, as specks of light brightened the sky, she escaped from slavery, fleeing on foot from Maryland to Pennsylvania, with the North Star as her guide.\n\nShe was born Araminta \u201cMinty\u201d Ross around 1820 in Dorchester County, Md. Years later, she changed her first name to her mother\u2019s name, Harriet; and in 1844, when she married John Tubman, a free black man, she changed her last name to Tubman.\n\nIn 1849 she began her exodus from a life of bondage on the Poplar Neck plantation to a new life of freedom in the North. Harriet Tubman traveled 90 miles to Philadelphia, carefully feeling her way through to a place she had no knowledge of but had met in her dreams.\n\n\u201cWhen I found I had crossed that line,\u201d she said, \u201cI looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.\u201d \u2014Harriet Tubman, Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman, by Sarah Hopkins Bradford\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTubman, a 5-foot-2-inch warrior, women\u2019s rights supporter and strategist, sought freedom at all costs.\n\n\u201cHer legacy is to keep going, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do, and I hope all African Americans are, too. [I hope we are] trying to keep going and make things better for us,\u201d Pauline Copes Johnson, Tubman\u2019s great-great-grandniece, told The Root.\n\nJohnson, who is 89 years old, found out she was related to Tubman when she was 25, and feels \u201ca goodness\u201d in being a part of Tubman\u2019s family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the 1980s, Johnson has traveled around the United States giving presentations to schools, senior citizens homes and organizations about Tubman\u2019s life before and after the Civil War, including the 50 years Tubman lived in upstate Auburn, N.Y.\n\n\u201cI love doing it. I just want people to know that all African Americans are not crazy, or they\u2019re not dumb, and they\u2019re not ignorant,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s part of the reason why I do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy telling Tubman\u2019s story, she wants people to become aware of African Americans\u2019 past in America.\n\n\u201c[History] is to know why we\u2019re here, where we came from and [that] our ancestors paid with their lives for many of the things they did,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur ancestors came from Africa. They were forced over here and put into slavery. They did the work of this country. Not the white man.\u201d\n\nAs a slave, Tubman suffered abuse daily and quickly sensed that her living conditions were inhumane. In addition to working in the fields, she was hired out to temporary masters to do work such as checking muskrat traps, loading timber and housekeeping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she was 7 years old, Tubman was hired as a nursemaid and was expected to stay up all night to care for an infant. If she fell asleep, or when the baby cried, she was whipped, often on her face and neck.\n\n\u201cShe was beat so much. I don\u2019t know how she withstood that. But she could,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAs a teen, Tubman was hired as a field hand to a farmer nearby. When an overseer tried to stop another slave who was trying to escape, Tubman intentionally stood in the way. The overseer picked up an iron weight and threw it at the other slave, but missed and hit Tubman on the forehead. She was in a coma for weeks; and for the rest of her life, she suffered from seizures, headaches, sleeping spells and visions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t be free from such violence until several years later, but relied on her faith to sustain her:\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s time [emancipation] is always near. He set the North Star in the heavens; He gave me the strength in my limbs; He meant I should be free.\u201d \u2014Harriet Tubman to Ednah Dow Cheney, New York City, circa 1859\n\nIn the moment she was free, however, she immediately realized that she was alone. This motivated her to return to the South to rescue her family members and friends in 1851, despite the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalled the \u201cMoses of Her People,\u201d Tubman took more than a dozen trips to the South over a 10-year period and used the Underground Railroad to help hundreds of slaves, including her loved ones, to escape to the Northern states and Canada.\n\n\u201cShe had it in her mind that all men should be free, and women too, and children,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd they had the chance to become free and they took that chance. They were very clever, and Harriet was the best conductor on the Underground Railroad. And I\u2019ll tell ya, I am very proud of her.\u201d\n\nAt one point in her journey, Tubman overheard men reading her wanted poster, which mentioned that she couldn\u2019t read or write. To mask her identity, she quickly grabbed a book and pretended to read it. Her swift response and wit saved her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is this history and all black history that encourages Johnson. She mentioned that she recently went to the movie theater to watch the film Hidden Figures, and criticized the fact that their story had been withheld for so long.\n\n\u201cWhen [African Americans] do good, they don\u2019t advertise it; but when they do bad things, oh my God, they\u2019re on the front pages of the newspaper,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to say it, but I think it is prejudice. African Americans built this country, from the South up [to New York], and they don\u2019t get any credit for it.\u201d\n\nShe added that Black History Month means a lot to her because it\u2019s a time when we discuss what African Americans have contributed to America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think black history should be suppressed. It should be brought out into the open,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we should only have one month to celebrate black history. I think it should be celebrated throughout the year.\u201d\n\nIn 1859 Tubman purchased a parcel of land in Auburn, N.Y., where she settled years later. On the property, she grew food for the needy, and in 1908 she established the Harriet Tubman Home for Aged and Indigent Colored People for elderly and impoverished individuals. She died on March 10, 1913, after suffering from pneumonia.\n\nJohnson, who also lives in Auburn, is excited about the nation\u2019s efforts to honor Tubman\u2019s life, including replacing President Andrew Jackson with Tubman\u2019s image on the front of the $20 bill; the U.S. Department of Interior taking steps to establish the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in her hometown in upstate New York; and the declaration of 2017 as the \u201cYear of Tubman\u201d by the Maryland Park Service, which, in partnership with the National Park Service, is opening the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park in Church Creek, Md., on March 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful that Aunt Harriet is getting recognition. She deserves all of the recognition she can get,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd I am so glad that she\u2019s going to be on the $20 bill. When they let me know that I said, \u2018Hallelujah, at last it has come to pass.\u2019\u201d\n\nA new photo of Tubman was revealed earlier this month, and historians say that she was between the ages of 43 and 46 when it was taken. Johnson viewed the image of Harriet and respects the woman it captured.\n\n\u201cShe certainly was bound and determined to be free, and that\u2019s what she did,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t look like she was afraid of anybody.\u201d", "keywords": ["life", "wants", "johnson", "living", "african", "tubman", "history", "greatgreatgrandniece", "celebrated", "tubmans", "black", "free", "americans", "harriet", "month"], "polarity": 0.11460978160416366, "subjectivity": 0.43345493457853},

Even though it is as old as humanity and has been the driving force of every movement that ever existed, when mentioned in conjunction with the history of black people in America, bringing up the subject of violence is forbidden.

The breakout of right-wing butt-hurt surrounding the educator comes from statements he made outside the university setting, on a podcast five years ago. Compounding the uproar\u2019s stupidity is the fact that Curry made a valid point:\n\nWhat we have today is a situation where the symbols of [Dr. Martin Luther] King and peaceful white progressives have become the hallmarks of the black civil rights struggle. ... What I\u2019m surprised about is that I\u2019ve seen no black public intellectual come out and actually address the issue of violence or social revolution or radical self-defense by black people historically.\n\nAlthough the quote seems innocuous enough in posing an academic question, when someone dug the interview out of the archives, right-wing outlets like the American Conservative and the Washington Examiner escalated the Africana-studies professor to the title of \u201canti-white hatemonger,\u201d who made \u201cgenocidal comments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to the outbreak of white butthurt, Texas A&M\u2019s president issued a public statement condemning Curry for his comments:\n\nAs you may know, a podcast interview by one of our professors that took place approximately four-and-a-half years ago resurfaced this week on social media, seen for the first time by many of us. The interview features disturbing comments about race and violence that stand in stark contrast to Aggie core values\u2014most notably those of respect, excellence, leadership and integrity\u2014values that we hold true toward all of humanity. ... We wish no violence or harm even to those who espouse hateful views under the First Amendment, a sentiment that by its very nature is one that they would deny others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the thing: No matter how many pearls white people begin clutching, an institution of higher learning should never condemn a professor for advancing academic thought. The consideration of radical thought is almost the textbook definition of philosophy.\n\nTexas A&M likely has a history class that teaches how the American Revolution was kick-started when a radical group called the Sons of Liberty boarded a ship and threw the tea overboard. I\u2019m sure there is a class that discusses how brave souls are reshaping the political and economic climate in the Middle East with the citizen-driven Arab Spring. Even the invisible deity, the idea of whom conservatives love, but whose words they conveniently ignore, believed that he couldn\u2019t save this cruel, corrupt world unless his son shed some blood.\n\nBut for black people? Not so much.\n\nIn all of this white-knuckle hand-wringing, Curry\u2019s larger point has been lost:\n\n\n\nThere has never been a major change movement in the history of the world that hasn\u2019t involved violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica has brainwashed both blacks and whites into believing that African Americans gained their rights by behaving obediently and observing the law. We have allowed them to white out from the history books the Black Panthers, Deacons for Defense and all the groups that advocated for self-defense. They conveniently forget that the only people who acted civilly during the civil rights movement were the people whose skin was ripped by water hoses and whose bones were shattered by batons.\n\nThe civil rights movement was not a movement of nonviolence. Ask Medgar Evers. Ask Malcolm X. Ask the mirage of whitewashed history that white America posthumously made a saint and a martyr after snuffing out his fire: Martin Luther King Jr. could confirm all of this if white violence had not splattered his brains across the balcony of a Memphis, Tenn., hotel.\n\nNow that we have uncovered the serious and introspective parts, there are two more parts of this debate that are simultaneously infuriating and hilarious:\n\nTexas A&M is the same school that recently allowed Richard Spencer\u2014the poster boy for the filtered lumps of diarrhea remnants who call themselves the \u201calt-right\u201d\u2014 to speak on campus and spread his message, which includes ethnic cleansing to make a whiter America. This is the same Richard Spencer who led a group of torch-bearing protesters reminiscent of a Ku Klux Klan mob in a Virginia rally for Confederate monuments last week and ...\n\n... this is the incredible part. In the podcast interview, Professor Curry was talking about the inhumane violence against whites and the results it produced ... in a movie!!!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this whole debate is about how some white people with sensitive sphincters have gotten their panties in a bunch by taking a professor out of context from a podcast discussing Django Unchained.\n\nOh, white America, you will never stop being funny.\n\nThe movie thing aside, silencing someone who actually studies the issues (Curry teaches a class on critical race theory) in favor of Caucasian emotions is the antithesis of education. It is what the hypocritical conservatives talk about when they lament the rise of political correctness. It is the privilege of discussing the musket bearers who fought for slavery while suppressing the mention of black freedom fighters. It is white fragility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some who will say this piece of writing advocates violence, just as there are people across Texas and the country calling for Curry to be fired for 5-year-old statements about a Jamie Foxx movie. Because everyone in America deserves the right to self-examination, freedom of speech and a safe space to openly examine their intellectual ideas ...\n\nExcept black people.", "keywords": ["white", "answer", "history", "podcast", "violence", "black", "rights", "curry", "movement", "america", "professor"], "polarity": 0.04543245869776482, "subjectivity": 0.3766844833171363},

Based upon the facts and recommendations presented to me, I made the decision to place Officer Derick Wiley on indefinite suspension. This is a term used for civil service employees, but it effectively means Officer Wiley\u2019s employment has been terminated.\n\nOur internal investigation revealed that Officer Wiley violated department policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will not be making any additional comments until the Dallas County Grand Jury completes its process.\n\n***\n\nEditor\u2019s note: At approximately 4:21 a.m. ET Saturday, Lyndo Jones was readmitted to the hospital because of serious complications stemming from the shooting. The Root will update you on his condition as details become available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerick Wiley, 35, a 10-year veteran with the Mesquite Police Department in Dallas County, Texas, will face a grand jury on Nov. 28 to determine if he will face criminal charges for the Nov. 8 shooting of Lyndo Jones, 31, Jones\u2019 attorney S. Lee Merritt exclusively shared with The Root.\n\n\n\nWiley is currently on paid administrative leave pending the conclusion of two separate investigations into the shooting, one by the Mesquite Police Department and the other by the Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nOn the night of Nov. 8, Jones was sitting inside his vehicle when the car alarm malfunctioned and began blaring. As he struggled to turn it off, someone approached him and asked if he needed assistance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones said that he did not, but that didn\u2019t stop the unidentified person from calling 911 and claiming that Jones was attempting to steal his own vehicle. The 911 call triggered a series of events that ended with Wiley shooting Jones twice in the back even though he was unarmed with his hands raised.\n\nJones was violently searched before being taken into custody and handcuffed to a bed while in critical condition at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was also denied his right to family visitation, according to his legal counsel, criminal defense attorney Justin Moore, who stepped in to represent Jones on behest of civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\nMerritt is representing Jones in his civil case against Dallas County and the Mesquite Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Jones was first taken into custody and hospitalized, there were no criminal charges filed against him, which led Moore to investigate why Jones was still technically being held by the Police Department.\n\nDays later, after Moore was forcibly removed from the hospital for insisting that the MPD immediately halt an illegal interrogation of his client, Jones was charged with evading arrest.\n\nAccording to Jones, he requested that his attorney be present for the questioning, but was told by MPD investigators that he didn\u2019t need an attorney because they weren\u2019t there to interrogate him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLt. Brian Parrish, a spokesperson for the Mesquite Police Department, insisted during a press conference that questioning Jones without legal counsel present was not in violation of his constitutional rights because he was not being questioned as a suspect but as a \u201cpossible complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my investigators spoke to this individual in the hospital ... it was consensual and it was in reference to him being shot. It was not in reference to any offense he may or may not have committed,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nParrish\u2019s claim runs counter to that of Jones\u2019 attorneys, who were told by guards that Jones would absolutely not be questioned without his lawyers present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office reviewed Wiley\u2019s bodycam footage of the shooting, leading District Attorney Faith Johnson to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Jones\u2014on the same day the MPD filed it\u2014and to open a criminal investigation against Wiley.\n\n\n\nJones was finally released on Nov. 15, but according to Parrish, the charge may be revisited.\n\nThe Mesquite Police Department claims that Jones \u201cdemonstrated such physical strength that it took three officers just to hold him down until paramedics could arrive at the scene to assess his injuries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that, I\u2019m not an expert on human strength, but I think if someone has been shot and handcuffed and on the ground, and it still takes four large men to hold him down, that might indicate there are other factors in place,\u201d Parrish told local station CBS-DFW.\n\nNot content to play games with the Mesquite Police Department, Merritt, who is representing Jones in his civil case against the MPD, unapologetically admits that his client was high on marijuana and cocaine while sitting in his parked vehicle. Still, he makes it clear that his being high should not give police officers license to shoot unarmed people who are minding their own business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe romanticized search for the perfect victim is futile and dangerous,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cMy client was doing absolutely nothing that warranted this police officer opening fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this pre-emptive, transparent vilification of innocent people play out time and time again,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cLyndo Jones is a hardworking father of two young daughters who was profiled by a stranger and shot by Officer Wiley for no reason at all. Wiley is the violent perpetrator here, not my client.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Merritt, the Nov. 28 grand jury hearing means nothing in and of itself. What matters, he says, is that Wiley will be charged and convicted of a crime that was not only a willful abuse of his state-sanctioned power but also emblematic of the violence that infests police departments across the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe district attorney [Faith Johnson] has not issued criminal charges against the officer who shot Lyndo Jones twice in the back with his hands up despite abundant probable cause,\u201d Merritt told The Root. \u201cOnly 1 percent of law-enforcement misconduct is prosecuted in the state of Texas. That is by design.\u201d\n\nMerritt, who also represents the family of Jordan Edwards, the 15-year-old boy fatally shot by Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver, says that the grand jury process is tainted and shrouded in secrecy, and only through exposing that truth is reform possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOliver was fired from his job and charged with one count of murder and four counts of aggravated assault by a public servant\u2014one charge for each of the young boys in the car with Jordan, including two of his brothers.\n\nThe charges alone against a police officer in Texas are extremely rare, but that is no cause for celebration. There has been no trial, yet; subsequently, there has been no conviction\u2014even though Oliver executed a child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProsecutors make unique exceptions when dealing with police involved malfeasance,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nIn Jones\u2019 case, Wiley\u2019s bodycam allegedly captured the entire incident, and his attorneys are openly encouraging the MPD to release the footage.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the video is highly incriminating against the police officer and my client, and I urge the Mesquite Police Department to be transparent and release it immediately,\u201d Merritt told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious organizations have formed the Coalition for Justice for Lyndo Jones, including Mothers Against Police Brutality, the American Black Cross, the Texas Organizing Project, Friendship-West Baptist Church, the Arlington chapter of the NAACP, the Dallas chapter of the NAACP, Faith-Forward Dallas and Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\n\nClick here to donate to the YouCaring fund established for Jones to assist with medical and legal expenses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to sign the petition urging the Dallas County DA\u2019s Office to issue an arrest warrant for Mesquite Police Officer Derick Wiley.", "keywords": ["officer", "dallas", "mesquite", "lyndo", "department", "shooting", "jones", "attorney", "told", "face", "grand", "texas", "merritt", "wiley", "jury", "fired"], "polarity": 0.04906768837803321, "subjectivity": 0.4688305053822294},

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts. And that\u2019s really all that matters.", "keywords": ["films", "panther", "negative", "movie", "review", "curve", "community", "white", "black", "grading", "film", "critics"], "polarity": 0.0007537447802934588, "subjectivity": 0.4251913892400615},

The jury convicted him of first-degree manslaughter and recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKepler and his daughter, Lisa Kepler, had previous arguments about her bringing men home, so she left. Shannon found out Lisa was dating Lake from a Facebook profile. Authorities testified that Shannon may have found Lake\u2019s address from a juvenile file that was supposed to be sealed. The back of the file listed Lake\u2019s address and his presumed race\u2014black.\n\nAccording to CBS News, in August 2014 Shannon Kepler sat in his SUV near Lake\u2019s home and spotted Lake and his 18-year-old daughter walking together. The 24-year veteran of the Tulsa Police Department said that he was trying to protect his daughter because she had run away from home numerous times and was living in a \u201ccrime-ridden neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Kepler saw the couple, he got out of his car and asked Lisa what she was doing there.

Then he fired again. Kepler claims that he only kept shooting because he saw Lake reaching for a semi-automatic weapon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bringing it, I\u2019m bringing it,\u201d Kepler said in court. \u201cIt was either him or me.

In each of the previous three trials, only one black person served on each jury. Each trial ended in a deadlocked jury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case was partially obscured by another police shooting four days earlier, when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson, Mo.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people.

Both \u201ccomplicit\u201d and \u201cfeminism\u201d were designated \u201cwords of the year\u201d (the first by Dictionary.com, the second by Merriam-Webster\u2019s) in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a year that saw the careers of dozens of the world\u2019s most powerful men crash and burn while a man accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse continued to tweet from the Oval Office. It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence. To break the hypnosis that continues to bind and betray us all.", "keywords": ["2017", "women", "white", "violence", "black", "innocence", "virtue", "shes", "armitage", "rose", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.06526736813871553, "subjectivity": 0.3853764921946739},

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts. And that\u2019s really all that matters.", "keywords": ["films", "panther", "negative", "movie", "review", "curve", "community", "white", "black", "grading", "film", "critics"], "polarity": 0.0007537447802934588, "subjectivity": 0.4251913892400615},

The deaths of these unarmed black men and women sparked the Black Lives Matter movement, Colin Kaepernick taking a knee, the Ferguson, Mo., revolt and dozens of other forms of resistance across the nation in the last five years.\n\nOften forgotten in these stories is the \u201clone survivor\u201d of Black Lives Matter, Leon Ford Jr. He faced death at the hands of police like so many others, but lived\u2014and his battle with the Pittsburgh criminal-justice system is a reminder that sometimes the hardest battles come after the shooting stops.\n\n\n\nYouTube screenshot\n\nIn November of 2012, Leon Ford Jr. was pulled over by police who were \u201cfishing\u201d in Pittsburgh\u2019s predominantly black District 5. Fishing is when police randomly run tags on cars looking for an excuse to pull someone over. Despite a 16-minute interrogation and Ford handing over his license, registration and other documentation, the police insisted that he was, in fact, Lamont Ford, a known gang member, and threatened Leon repeatedly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficer Andrew Miller jumped into Ford\u2019s car and attempted to pull him out through the passenger side. When the vehicle kicked into gear during the struggle, another officer, David Derbish, shot Ford five times. Ford remembers falling out of his car onto the concrete, bleeding, as the officers cursed over his body, mocking him, hoping that he\u2019d die. If it weren\u2019t for the actions of a good Samaritan calling an ambulance, Ford might\u2019ve been on the list of names at the start of this story. As a reminder of the perverse power of racism, the Pittsburgh district attorney charged Leon Ford Jr. with criminal assault of the officers, and it wasn\u2019t until spring of 2015, almost three years after he was shot, that the charges were thrown out and the DA chose not to pursue other charges.\n\nDuring that time, all three of the officers involved, despite being under investigation, were promoted to detective. Ford\u2019s own civil rights case against the officers who shot him ended on Tuesday with less-than-stellar results. Officer Miller was found not guilty of assault and battery, and the jury deadlocked on whether Derbish used excessive force. We spoke to Ford and his lawyer Thomas Malone about what comes next.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Leon, you survived getting shot by police five times, then having the DA attempt to charge you with criminal assault. You got through all of that. Why sue the police? Why not just say, \u201cI got through this\u2014I just want to get on with my life?\u201d\n\n\n\nLeon Ford Jr.: I wanted to stand up and get justice. I witnessed [the police] lie under oath in criminal court. I watched them get away with shooting me, and I could not let that happen. I felt convicted in my spirt to not let this happen. I felt I had to not only fight for myself but for others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I had been content with letting this thing go and not fought it, then things would not have come out. There are things that police testified to under oath. These are gonna be things that in the near future we can use to change some policy in Pennsylvania and across the country.\n\nThomas Malone: In a situation like this where the police officer who shot Leon wasn\u2019t arrested, there was really no other avenue for justice. The difference in this case is that Leon lived through it. The whitewashing that the facts often get didn\u2019t happen in this situation. If he hadn\u2019t survived, then their version of the story\u2014that the officers shot him because he dragged them with his car\u2014would have survived the paperwork, and they\u2019d have gone about their business. There is a ton of information that we got through the civil discovery process.\n\nIt took almost years of pretrial motions for Leon Ford to get his day in court against the officers who profiled him, harassed him and attempted to kill him. But during that process and the trial, it came out that the officers in question, Michael Kosko, Andrew Miller and David Derbish, had all left their microphones in their squad cars when they pulled Ford over. After years of Ford insisting that he complied with everything the officers asked, only through trial was it revealed and proven through a distant microphone that he asked, \u201cCan I just get my ticket and go home?\u201d while the officers screamed, \u201cFuck you, you\u2019re talking to the cops,\u201d and \u201cYou better get your black ass out of the car when police tell you to get out of the car.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was also made clear during the trial that the police lied by claiming that they thought Ford had a gun, claiming they saw an unnatural bulge, but only two of the three officers mentioned it in their report because they hadn\u2019t had time to get their stories together.\n\nTR: Leon, you were one of the first \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d stories. You were shot the same year that Trayvon Martin was killed. You\u2019ve seen Ferguson, Tamir Rice and other stories. What have the last five years taught you about America\u2019s criminal-justice system? Are things getting better or worse?\n\nLF: The last five years have taught me that most people are happy with lip service. When I think of how they have stepped out and spoke about police brutality\u2014there\u2019s gonna come a time when they\u2019re gonna put up or shut up. When they do give that lip service, they stand behind policies that encourage brutality and racial division.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTM: I\u2019ve seen some change. We showed up for [civil trial] jury selection with 94 people\u2014not ONE African American on the panel. One of the prospective jurors asked me a question which is rare\u2014most prospective jurors don\u2019t ask anything\u2014she said, \u201cIs this fair that Leon\u2019s jury is going to be all white people?\u201d That\u2019s change. At least somebody noticed that. There were a couple Asian, Hispanic, Indian, Pakistani people in the jury pool but nobody black, and it\u2019s supposed to be a jury of his peers. I\u2019m proud of the work we did. I\u2019m proud of the fact that we live to fight another day.\n\nTR: Leon, what\u2019s next for you in the trial, in activism and even personally? I\u2019ve seen online that you\u2019re able to walk now with some assistance, which is a miracle. What new activism will you be engaging in going forward?\n\nLF: Personally, I did write a book\u2014that\u2019s on ice until this case is finished. I\u2019ll be out at universities sharing my story. Helping families that are experiencing the same thing around the country. Moving forward with my rehabilitation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTM: Oct. 20, we will stand ready to go and pick a new jury\u2014and try this case again and make sure justice gets done.\n\nIf you want to be inspired, take a look at video of Ford finally being able to walk on his own, five years after being shot by police. He\u2019s benefited from several rehabilitation centers in Pittsburgh and even the use of exoskeleton technology that allows him to move without a walker. He also plans to meet with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and discuss ways that his tragic experience can be prevented in the lives of others.\n\n", "keywords": ["loses", "ford", "survivor", "jr", "officers", "trial", "lives", "things", "lone", "pittsburgh", "pursues", "leon", "black", "matter", "justice", "jury", "shot"], "polarity": 0.04744188459941883, "subjectivity": 0.47508648125086483},

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children. That when the brother of the deceased asks, \u201cBased on the information that you\u2019ve collected, do you think we\u2019re due something?\u201d and LASD Capt. Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children. If you disagree, then do your job\u2014report the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is black grief in its entirety.\n\nHere are a few quick tips to help you get started on your path of true reporting:\n\nInstead of \u201cgang member,\u201d use \u201cchild.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cangry mob,\u201d use \u201cgrieving community.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cchaos,\u201d use \u201ccompletely rational response to the murder of a 16-year-old.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Department said \u2026 ,\u201d use \u201cthe family and community said \u2026 \u201d\n\nInstead of catering to racists and opportunists, cater to justice and peace for the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there are further questions\u2014and there should be\u2014reach out directly to the affected family, community or local organizations doing the work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that easy. Somehow, POC media is capable of doing that in every story. Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground. The media also initially reported her nephew as a suspect and gang member.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJasmyne Cannick is a nationally known writer and commentator on politics, race and social issues.

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts.

Ain\u2019t gonna tear up my cars.\u201d\n\nShoupe was not part of the slow-speed chase that spanned two counties, but he arrived on scene shortly after his officers fired the deadly shots, which was when his comments were recorded.\n\n\u201cI love this shit,\u201d he continues. \u201cGod, I tell you what, I thrive on it. If they don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give the damn order to kill that motherfucker, they\u2019re full of shit. Take him out. I\u2019m here on the damn wrong end of the county.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaughter can be heard as the sheriff makes his comments.\n\nThe incident began last April when Smithville, Tenn., police tried to pull Dial over for driving on a suspended license. At the time, he was driving a 1976 pickup with a fully loaded trailer being pulled at the back. The chase started in DeKalb County before crossing over into White County, where White County deputies took over the chase.\n\nDial\u2019s wife, Robyn, says she is still not sure how the situation escalated so quickly, leading to the death of her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop?\u201d Robyn Dial said. \u201cHe was scared. I know him enough to know that.\u201d\n\nThe chase never reached high speeds. DeKalb County deputies told the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that the chase was more like a funeral procession.\n\nWhen asked by an investigator from the bureau how fast the cars were going, DeKalb County Detective Jimmy Martin responded, \u201cWe might have got up to 50 at one point. For the most part, it was 30 to 40 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeKalb deputies backed off at the county line and handed off the chase to White County, whose deputies tried to use their patrol cars to get Dial to stop. Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was driving his personal pickup at the time, also got involved in the chase.\n\nAs noted earlier, Shoupe was not part of the chase but gave the ultimately fatal orders.\n\n\u201cPer 59 [the sheriff], use deadly force if necessary. Take the subject out by any means necessary,\u201d a radio dispatcher can be heard telling the deputies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that order, West took out his gun. According to News Channel 5, minutes later, deputies managed to push Dial\u2019s truck off the road. West got out of his truck and immediately opened fire. Sparta Police Officer Charlie Simms also started shooting.\n\nDial was hit in the head.\n\n\u201cI feel with every part of me that\u2019s exactly what they wanted to do, was kill him,\u201d Robyn Dial told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe district attorney ruled the shooting justified, but Robyn Dial\u2019s lawsuit is focused on the callous remarks the sheriff made after her husband was killed. She is suing not only the sheriff but also White County, West and Simms.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that Shoupe \u201cpreferred to shoot and kill Mr. Dial rather than risk damaging his patrol cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can thrive on taking a human life. That\u2019s not law enforcement,\u201d attorney David Weissman told the news station. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mentality of the highest policymaker in the county, that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Deputy West is clearly upset, but Shoupe can be heard comforting him, telling him that he had done right by following orders.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. I made the decision. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I took that away from y\u2019all. You don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Everything\u2019s cool. You done exactly right,\u201d the sheriff says.\n\nRobyn Dial still doesn\u2019t believe that her husband had to die.\n\n\u201cThey could have let him go 10 more miles down the road; he probably would have run out of gas. ... I just hope he knows I loved him,\u201d Dial said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time that Shoupe has been subject to a federal lawsuit. Late last year, both Shoupe and White County Judge Sam Benningfield were hit with suits accusing them of carrying out \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d after Benningfield signed a standing order permitting inmates to get 30 days\u2019 credit toward jail time if they agreed to a birth control procedure\u2014either a vasectomy or a birth control implant.", "keywords": ["west", "sheriff", "man", "unarmed", "deputies", "officers", "ordering", "shit", "recorded", "chase", "white", "dont", "shoot", "told", "tennessee", "shoupe", "dial", "county", "slowspeed"], "polarity": 0.015366193260930094, "subjectivity": 0.43372876636034524},

Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund was conceptualized \u201cto promote the education of deserving undergraduate students who enroll full time at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\u201d\n\nAs The Root previously reported, 15-year-old Jordan, two of his brothers and their friends were leaving a house party on April 29, 2017, when Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver pointed his rifle at the car full of teens and opened fire, fatally shooting Jordan in the head.\n\nOliver was eventually fired and indicted on murder charges, but not before Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber attempted to justify Jordan\u2019s extrajudicial killing. Haber initially claimed that the car in which Jordan was traveling was \u201cbacking down the street toward officers in an aggressive manner,\u201d which prompted Oliver to open fire.\n\nHaber later admitted during a press conference that he lied \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cAfter reviewing the video, I don\u2019t believe that [the fatal shooting] met our core values,\u201d Haber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan, a freshman honor student and athlete at Mesquite High School, dreamed of attending the University of Alabama and playing football for the Crimson Tide. Oliver ended those dreams with a single bullet, but Jordan\u2019s legacy will not die.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,\u201d the scholarship\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan. ... It will be the duty of the scholarship recipients to carry on a legacy of hope in Jordan\u2019s name, hope for a better, diverse tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen Brandon P. Bell, who plays the character Troy in Dear White People, heard Jordan\u2019s story, he connected with the teen on a visceral level and knew that he had to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was motivated by frustration. I\u2019m from Dallas, so I have that connection, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Bell said in an interview with The Root.\n\n\u201cI read about Jordan\u2019s story and was on the verge of tears. I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do it specifically for the family,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo I reached out to them to see how they wanted to honor Jordan\u2019s legacy, and they wanted to do that through education. Everything started from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarque Richardson, who plays Reggie on Dear White People, has been with Bell every step of the way in seeing this scholarship fund come to fruition. He also traveled with Bell to Texas to meet Jordan\u2019s family.\n\n\n\n\u201cUA was Jordan\u2019s dream school, but his life\u2014and the opportunity to realize his dreams\u2014was stolen from him and his family,\u201d Richardson told The Root.\n\nBoth Bell and Richardson said that the scholarship fund was created to give students the opportunity to live out their dreams because Jordan no longer can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the scholarship specifies that funds will be awarded to \u201cdeserving students,\u201d Bell made it clear that \u201cdeserving\u201d is about much more than grades and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concept of being deserving is so vast,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about how someone looks on paper, not just their GPA. But do they represent who Jordan was as a person? Do they understand\u2014or are they trying to learn\u2014about the systemic oppression that creates the environment where Jordan\u2019s death can take place?\n\n\u201cThe family created an essay question for the scholarship, and it really reflects the heart of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichardson agreed, adding that supporting students and helping them navigate a racist society is critical.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help pave the way so that our leaders of tomorrow have the tools they need to create the change we need,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to take it to the streets, but we also have to have people in positions to influence policy and legislation, to change the world on an institutional level. That\u2019s what this scholarship is about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to create space for our children to be supported in the fullness of their humanity,\u201d Richardson continued. \u201cWe have to do what we can do to help them reach their goals. They deserve that. This scholarship fund is an entity that will last forever, and it\u2019s one more tool that, at its core, can be used to keep our people alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The Root, civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt, who represents the Edwards family, said, \u201cThe murder of Jordan Edwards represented not only a tragic loss to his family, but his death robbed our community of a valuable resource of potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis scholarship fund is an ingenious mechanism for beginning to make up for that great loss, but it can\u2019t end here,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cWe are pushing to get police reform legislation passed in Jordan\u2019s name, a football stadium dedicated to his memory and above all a historical conviction in the Texas Criminal Courts for his murderer, Roy Oliver.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs college costs continue to rise, Bell said that it was also important to him to lift the economic burden from students\u2019 shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without the support of the community, cast, and Jordan\u2019s love of life guiding the way,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI have learned that we must rely on each other for support.\u201d\n\nClick here to donate to the Jordan J.

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts. And that\u2019s really all that matters.", "keywords": ["films", "panther", "negative", "movie", "review", "curve", "community", "white", "black", "grading", "film", "critics"], "polarity": 0.0007537447802934588, "subjectivity": 0.4251913892400615},

But the picture many saw told only one side of the story.\n\nPolice killed the woman, Korryn Gaines, and her 5-year-old son was wounded in the altercation. She had attempted to share her encounter with police using Instagram. The police urged Facebook, which owns Instagram, to deactivate her accounts. In response, Facebook cut Gaines\u2019 live stream from its feed.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. In July, Diamond Reynolds used Facebook Live to record the immediate aftermath of the horrific police shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile. Once footage hit 1 million views, Facebook temporarily removed the video. A Facebook spokesperson claimed this was due to a \u201ctechnical glitch,\u201d but many media reports suggest otherwise.\n\nFor many, Facebook has come to represent a public square\u2014a place where we can assemble with others, share information and speak our minds. But it isn\u2019t public. It\u2019s a private platform where everyone\u2019s rights to connect and communicate are subject to Facebook\u2019s often arbitrary terms and conditions.\n\nThe Constitution protects everyone\u2019s right to record police officers in the public discharge of their duties. But this right goes only as far as your smartphone. Once people decide to share the resulting videos\u2014including those that expose shocking police abuses\u2014the potential for state and private forces to censor the footage becomes very real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook claims to take down or block videos that glorify violence and says that it will grant law-enforcement requests to suspend accounts in cases where there is an \u201cimmediate risk of harm,\u201d but that\u2019s a vague and difficult standard to apply, and one that\u2019s subject to police discretion.\n\nThe Gaines and Reynolds videos remind us that social media companies like Facebook, Google (which owns YouTube) and Twitter ultimately control our ability to share the images that have fueled the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nThe fact that these companies can arbitrarily remove our speech, images and videos has serious consequences for those struggling to expose racial injustice to a wider audience. Earlier this week, more than 40 social justice and digital-rights groups sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter (pdf) urging the company to clarify its policy on honoring police requests to censor videos and other content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe groups, which include the Center for Media Justice, ColorOfChange.org, Daily Kos, Free Press and SumOfUs, also asked Facebook to restore Gaines\u2019 videos from her encounter with police so the public can decide whether the police violated her rights.\n\nIn the second half of 2015, Facebook received 855 requests from government and local authorities, including local police forces, for \u201cemergency\u201d action related to users\u2019 accounts. According to Facebook, these actions included the blocking of user access to accounts as well as the handover of user information. Over that time period, the company complied with nearly 3 out of every 4 such requests.\n\nThis raises several questions: Will police demand that Facebook cover up potential abuses that witnesses have recorded and then shared on the platform, even when there is no real risk of immediate harm? And how will it respond when the risk of harm comes from police violence itself? Shouldn\u2019t our right to record such interactions with law enforcement include our right to share these recordings with others?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook needs clear guidelines and processes that are transparent to users on how it determines whether to block someone\u2019s stream or deactivate an account. It shouldn\u2019t allow police to demand takedown requests to avoid scrutiny or cover up abuse. We need to know when and why Facebook and other social media platforms have granted these requests, with clear standards for the future.\n\n\u201cRisk of harm\u201d is a factor, but one could interpret that standard to justify censoring almost any interaction with law enforcement\u2014and especially those in which an interaction escalates because of a person\u2019s race.\n\nThe fight for racial equity in the media is often a fight against media monopoly, especially when these companies are white-owned and operated. And Facebook is a face of monopoly in the age of social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew gatekeepers like Facebook must make confronting racism a priority. Yes, Zuckerberg has been outspoken in his support for racial justice\u2014even hanging a Black Lives Matter sign outside company headquarters. But we must urge him to ensure that his company\u2019s actions match his words.

There is no way they were threatened by anything. He was only trying to get away.\u201d\n\nThe encounter started when officers pulled over Harmon for riding a bicycle without a light. How does a man wind up dead from a traffic stop over a bicycle?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Salt Lake City officials insist that the shooting was justified because officers feared for their lives. Of course. It is completely natural to fear someone who is running in the opposite direction from you. Never mind that footage clearly shows that another officer had deployed his Taser at the same time Fox fatally shot Harmon.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the district attorney\u2019s office claimed that Harmon said, \u201cI\u2019ll cut you,\u201d then turned and faced officers with a knife as he was running.\n\nThe video seems to tell another story, however, since Harmon cannot be heard making that threat and never appears to turn toward officers before he is shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Video contains graphic footage.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was scared. All he did was run,\u201d Adriane Harmon, another niece, told The Guardian. \u201cIt hurts. \u2026 They said, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you,\u2019 and they shot him three times. He\u2019s just moaning on the ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Tribune, when officers stopped Harmon for his alleged traffic infraction, Harmon apparently gave the officer a name that did not have a match in the police database. The officer again asked Harmon to spell his last name, and according to the district attorney\u2019s report, Harmon gave \u201ca couple of different names.\u201d\n\nFootage shows Harmon spelling his name quietly as the officer asked for clarification several times. Eventually the officer went back to his squad car, and Harmon admitted to the officer that he may find a warrant out for a felony charge.\n\nThe officer called for backup, and two more officers arrived on the scene.\n\nEventually, the officer did find out that Harmon had arrest warrants out, including one for a felony related to an aggravated assault charge. The warrant was issued in April after Harmon did not show up for sentencing after pleading guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also another warrant out for Harmon regarding his not complying with probation requirements after pleading guilty in a misdemeanor drug-possession case, the records show.\n\nAnd so, officers informed Harmon that he was going to be arrested under those warrants.\n\nAs officers started to detain him, Harmon was heard pleading with officers, apparently not wanting to go to jail, and he appeared to be crying. And that\u2019s when he bolted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe officer who originally stopped Harmon drew his stun gun, but the other officer, Fox, decided that three shots at a fleeing suspect were appropriate.\n\nFox told investigators that he saw a knife in Harmon\u2019s hand with the blade exposed and believed that another officer was in danger\u2019s way.\n\nAll of that is, again, not clear in the video.\n\nWhat is decidedly clear is Fox shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking shoot you!\u201d before firing at Harmon\u2019s back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the fact that Harmon was critically wounded, officers still handcuffed him, though they attempted to give him first aid at the scene.\n\nInvestigators say they found a knife on the ground.\n\nAs The Guardian notes, Salt Lake City had previously been praised for its \u201cde-escalation\u201d training, and the department is known for giving out \u201cde-escalation awards.\u201d However, such de-escalation seems not to have come into play in Harmon\u2019s case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe police are going to stick together no matter if it\u2019s wrong or right,\u201d Antoinette Harmon, Harmon\u2019s older sister, told The Guardian. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about black lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat officer disregarded his de-escalation training,\u201d Lex Scott, a local Black Lives Matter organizer, told The Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s just brutal. How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department declined to answer any questions about the case, but Police Chief Mike Brown released a statement: \u201cWe trust the process and support the decision from District Attorney Sim Gill. I believe our officers have the training and judgement and ability to make split-second decisions in dynamic situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Salt Lake Tribune and The Guardian.", "keywords": ["harmon", "video", "man", "officer", "knife", "district", "salt", "shooting", "officers", "guardian", "told", "fatally", "black", "lake", "shows", "harmons", "justified", "flee", "utah"], "polarity": -0.019805194805194798, "subjectivity": 0.4253463203463203},

The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn\u2019t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow people are wondering.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department is currently in court over one of the biggest scandals in the history of American law enforcement. The corruption case is replete with intrigue as police reveal secrets that sound like something out of an urban-fiction novel or a lost season of The Wire. It has revealed how one of America\u2019s largest cities just happened to be filled with crooked cops, but no one seems to be talking about it outside of Baltimore.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, it started when a 19-year-old woman from New Jersey overdosed in 2011 and authorities began tracing the origin of the drugs. It led them to a Baltimore drug crew and the discovery that a Baltimore police officer was involved. By the time they finished investigating, eight members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force had been charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to robbery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou want robbery? How about the story of the corrupt squad stopping a drug dealer during a traffic stop and robbing him of $6,500, then going to the man\u2019s home without a warrant and taking another $100,000 out of a safe? Sgt. Wayne Jenkins would ask suspected drug dealers, \u201cIf you could put together a crew of guys and rob the biggest drug dealer in town, who would it be?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in police targeting regular citizens, maybe you should read about how the Maurice Ward had a technique of driving fast at groups of people, slamming on the brakes and chasing whoever ran. Perhaps you hear how Jenkins believed that all young men with backpacks were dope boys. Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the revelation that the supervisor of the unit instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves \u201cin a jam\u201d and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn\u2019t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese revelations aren\u2019t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won\u2019t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before he was set to testify.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: After the death of Freddie Gray and the discovery of multiple officers who planted drugs on suspects, the Baltimore Police Department is one of the most corrupt departments in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they\u2019re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the cop who killed Tamir Rice after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who said he shot a man because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid police informant planted cocaine in a store owner\u2019s shop.\n\nIt is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away. And they will get away with it so often that we are shocked when they are indicted.\n\nThat\u2019s the real story.", "keywords": ["case", "unarmed", "maybe", "officers", "plant", "guns", "gun", "cops", "kept", "person", "boy", "toy", "department", "shot", "baltimore", "drug"], "polarity": 0.05545454545454546, "subjectivity": 0.4552587412587413},

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["hiring", "simply", "designers", "missing", "industry", "black", "designer", "talent", "chasemarshall", "fashion", "problem", "action"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

Baltimore County police shot and killed 23-year-old Korryn Gaines in a confrontation at her home that injured her 5-year-old son. Officers used lethal force to execute an arrest warrant, actions that many are questioning as a needless provocation that we\u2019ve seen too many times before. The fact that Gaines previously used social media to record her interactions with police and that she may have been suffering from emotional problems only exacerbates this latest tragedy.\n\nIn Los Angeles\u2019 Compton neighborhood, Donnell Thompson, a mentally challenged black man, was killed by SWAT officers who mistakenly believed that he was a carjacker. The incident happened in late July, and authorities are only now admitting the case of mistaken identity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t treat an animal this bad,\u201d observed his sister as she mourned her brother\u2019s senseless death.\n\nThe same day Thompson was killed in California, Chicago police chased down and killed Paul O\u2019Neal, an 18-year-old suspected car thief. Police cameras show officers repeatedly shooting at the vehicle O\u2019Neal was driving and handcuffing him as he lay in his own pool of blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe coroner\u2019s finding that O\u2019Neal had been shot in the back has led to widespread protest in Chicago, which has a horrific recent history of anti-black police shootings.\n\nBut the latest front in this ongoing racial battlefield is in Milwaukee, which erupted after police shot and killed a 23-year-old armed black man during a confrontation. Local residents staged protests\u2014some of which turned violent\u2014that railed against decades of civic neglect in some of the city\u2019s poorest areas.\n\nJust as in Ferguson and Baltimore, television images capturing racial violence on Milwaukee\u2019s impoverished north side focused on burning cars, looted stores, and clashes between police and demonstrators while glossing over the high rates of poverty, unemployment and police abuse of local residents in which the violence is rooted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the focus in the media is on the symptoms of systemic racism\u2014unrest and protest\u2014and not the root cause igniting these fires. But not everyone is turning a blind eye to the blight, neglect and police-inflicted violence that plague these neighborhoods.\n\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s recent report on racist police practices in Baltimore inadvertently explains Milwaukee\u2019s uprising and serves as a warning that, without substantive political changes, other cities may explode. The Baltimore report reveals a brutally exploitative system of racial profiling, harassment and drug arrests that constitutes a virtual war against black residents waged by a Police Department that is 44 percent black.\n\n\u201cA Vision for Black Lives,\u201d a radical policy agenda authored by a coalition of Black Lives Matter activists, represents a political and policy response to events happening in Milwaukee, Baltimore and elsewhere around the nation. The agenda calls for eliminating racial bias in prisons at the federal, state and local levels and redirecting federal resources from prison building and police task forces into community building; drug rehabilitation; mental-health facilities; and education, employment and environmental resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore important, the BLM policy agenda challenges all Americans to reimagine the relationship among citizens, governments and institutions. In short, it calls for a political revolution. Racial violence and dehumanization in America have become so routine that for every black body that receives national attention, there are many more whose deaths are rendered virtually invisible.\n\nChanging this cycle requires taking funds used to militarize police departments and redistributing them to black communities in need of mental-health services, jobs, schools and drug-rehabilitation facilities. The philosophy of law and order has corrupted not only the criminal-justice system but also much of America\u2019s political system. Assaults on black voting rights, chronic unemployment, deteriorating schools and neighborhoods, and the astonishing increase in the number of black women in city jails are all part of our ongoing national civil discourse that is rarely mentioned in public, but whose effects proliferate all around us.\n\nThe criminal-justice system represents a gateway to institutions, polices and practices that are undermining the life chances of black people at a generational level. As the Baltimore report shows, the real tragedy lies in acknowledging the black quotidian: the struggles of ordinary, everyday African-American communities to survive against a war-torn landscape where police act less as public servants and more as an occupying army for a war that\u2019s been waged for decades but has yet to be publicly declared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeniel E.

Courtney was wanted on an assault warrant. Gaines was wanted on a failure-to-appear warrant that started over traffic tickets.\n\nPolice say they could hear people in the apartment, although no one answered the door. An officer gained a key to the apartment and opened the door, and Gaines reportedly pointed a shotgun at him. A tactical team was called. A seven-hour standoff ensued. Courtney grabbed a 1-year-old child and made a break for it. He was arrested and taken into custody. Gaines and her 5-year-old son stayed in the apartment. It all ended when police stormed the residence and shot and killed the 23-year-old mother and wounded her 5-year-old son.\n\nKorryn Gaines' death is a tragedy. Full stop.\n\nBut I don't believe she's a victim.\n\nBefore we go on, let me be clear: I am no police apologist. I believe that too many times in this country, racist police resort to aggressive tactics when policing black folk. I also believe that there is a systemic blue wall of brotherhood that looks a lot like the Ku Klux Klan. I still believe that N.W.A's \"F\u2014k tha Police\" is the most important political doctrine ever written because it captures the true essence of being othered in a heightened police state.\n\n\n\nF\u2014k the police Coming straight from the underground A young n\u2014ga got it bad cause I'm brown. And not the other color so police think they have the authority to kill a minority.\n\nSince Gaines' death, countless theories and videos have emerged like bread crumbs on an endless trail to make sense of what feels like a senseless death. I don\u2019t feel any closer to understanding this tragedy even as more information becomes available. But I can say this: Gaines' death has me completely conflicted about everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a firm supporter of the Movement for Black Lives, I don't know how an armed Gaines being gunned down by police fits into the unarmed narrative of senseless black death. Yes, her death feels like an avoidable tragedy (because it was), but it was also one that Gaines could have de-escalated. Am I upset that Gaines' son was shot in the melee? Absolutely! But I'm equally upset that Gaines put her son's life at risk.\n\nI don\u2019t think that Gaines needs to be a perfect victim in order to grieve the tragedy of her death, but I do wonder what recourse the police had. She was armed. A seven-hour standoff netted them nothing. She didn't answer the door and refused to give up her weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that she had a gun because she posted a video of herself loading a Mossberg 12-gauge pistol-grip pump shotgun while police were at her door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I don't know of another statement that encapsulates N.W.A's seminal classic more than the last few lines of her social media post, which read: \"Thought i was gon have to take out a [n\u2014ga] nd [sic] realized i had a bigger problem. [F\u2014k] it Let's dance, i got some rhythm.\"\n\nThat doesn't sound like the words of someone who was afraid of what was to come.\n\nDuring a May 2016 police stop, Gaines was clear, telling the officer, \"If you put your hands on me, you're going to have to murder me.\"\n\nLet's be clear about this: Gaines was not a victim of overaggressive policing; she was a young woman who declared that she was tired of being harassed by police she believed were targeting her. So she took up arms and stood her ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not advocate this form of rebellious citizenship, and we have to be clear about where we stand when we talk about policing our community. When we advocate for vigilante justice, we do a disservice to a nonviolent movement. When we champion vigilantism over structured government, we are headed toward chaos.\n\nI know that these facts are indisputable: Gaines said during a nonconfrontational police stop that she would have to be killed if police touched her. During the Aug. 1 police encounter, Gaines refused to answer the door or leave the apartment as police instructed. Gaines stayed in the apartment during a seven-hour negotiation with a loaded weapon and her 5-year-old son.\n\nI've heard the Cliven Bundy comparisons, and let me remind people of a few things: #YallQaeda took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. It wasn't a hostage situation. And, in the end, one person was killed and another was wounded during a shootout with police. People did die, and they didn't have to, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn truth, making Gaines a victim takes away her agency. It makes her helpless when she was anything but. She was a soldier who was willing to die for what she believed, even if the war was skewed.\n\nIs there a war between black people and police? At times, it can feel like it. But there is a thin line between protesting for equal rights under the law and taking up arms. This was a militia-style fight, and I don't think Gaines would want to be remembered as a helpless person. She fought for that freedom she believed in to her core.\n\nAs tragic as her death may be, I urge caution in taking up her fight. She was no Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Philando Castille. She was not Sandra Bland or Rekia Boyd, and she doesn't need to be. Maybe it's the deaths of those unarmed people that pushed Gaines over the edge; that pushed her to take up arms and take up a fight she believed was just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo act as if her fight was lost demeans her legacy. Even if I don't agree with Gaines' aggressive action, I know that she was tired, and I know what tired looks like.\n\nStephen A. Crockett Jr. is a senior editor at The Root.

That\u2019s when the law-enforcement-adjacent officer decided that he needed to act quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs they were walking, the student became noncompliant on two separate occasions and made an attempt to free herself by pulling away from the officer,\u201d said Vasquez. \u201cTo prevent the student from escaping, the officer forced the student to the ground.\u201d\n\nThe officer reflected on the carnage of recent pepper-spray attacks like the Las Vegas Pepper Spray Attack, often called the largest mass peppering in U.S. history, when a woman pepper-sprayed four guys outside Circus Circus trying to hand out flyers for the Bunny Ranch.\n\nIn the La Mesa case, the quick-thinking policeman decided to defuse the issue with an MMA-style body slam of an already handcuffed 17-year-old girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe threw her entire body over his shoulder and then pinned her to the ground using his knees.

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["wakanda", "finally", "video", "panther", "colston", "movie", "fans", "friends", "work", "internets", "talk", "white", "look", "black", "going", "lowe", "favorite"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549},

The reason the police were there in the first place is still sketchy. Initially it was reported that the 23-year-old mother was being served a warrant for a failure to appear in court, and now news has come out that police were serving an arrest warrant. The police claim she pointed a shotgun at an officer during the initial encounter, which escalated the incident. While the story of exactly what happened is still unfolding, what we do know is this: Gaines was shot and killed during the incident, and her 5-year-old son was wounded.\n\nWhat's left behind is a social media puzzle of clues as to who Gaines may have been before her fatal encounter with police. Videos posted on social media show a woman who might have been a \u201csovereign citizen.\u201d It's important in this heightened police climate that we stay informed. While the waters of sovereign citizenship are murky, with the doctrine dating back to the 18th century, below is a brief synopsis of the movement that law-enforcement agencies have identified as one of the largest domestic terrorist threats in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhat Is a Sovereign Citizen?\n\nA sovereign citizen is a person who holds complex anti-government beliefs and doesn't believe in government-ordered practices like paying taxes or registering a car with the state. Sovereigns also believe that by denouncing their citizenship, ripping up their Social Security card, and refusing to pay taxes or register their vehicle with the appropriate state, they are no longer ruled by federal law.\n\nJ.J. MacNab, who has studied the phenomenon for over a decade, told CBS that a sovereign citizen \"has a twisted sense of history and he thinks that people who lived in the 18th century were free of all legal constraints. And they want to return to that time now.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center notes that the majority of sovereign citizens are African American but that the origins are rooted in racist, anti-Semitic beliefs.\n\nSovereigns often destroy all forms of documentation, including driver's licenses, license plates, vehicle registration and Social Security numbers, and believe that in doing so, they are absolved from being under federal rule.\n\nMost have a skewed view of what the government can and cannot do and challenge those who impose what they consider to be unjust laws. They've been known to use archaic, and oftentimes misinterpretations of, laws to justify their position.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Korryn Gaines a Sovereign Citizen?\n\nPossibly. During a March traffic stop, which was recorded on video, an officer can be heard telling Gaines that she had cardboard signs for license plates. One cardboard sign reportedly had the words \"Free Traveler\" written on it. Sovereign citizens often refer to themselves as free travelers. The other had the following phrase written on it: \"Any government official who compromises this pursuit to happiness and right to travel, will be held criminally responsible and fined, as this is a natural right to freedom.\"\n\nSovereign citizens believe that the government not only is wrong in detaining them but also has acted with impunity because U.S. citizens are ignorant of their rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaines can be heard stating that she doesn't \"follow their laws\" and repeatedly asks the officer for a delegation-of-authority order. If Gaines was, in fact, a sovereign citizen, then she would have believed that state and federal laws did not apply to her.\n\nIn a caption posted with her March arrest video, Gaines posted this:\n\n\n\nConstitutional Law is the only true law. In order to be granted the role as Law enforcement u must take an oath to uphold the Constitution and be granted a DOAO DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY ORDER. The police are not Law enforcement they are Policy enforcers and operate outside of the laws of the Constitution which would make them organized criminals. They enforce CORPORATE Law (to generate revenue, in others words to get money, however in this case they know that i know this nd this is them making trouble with me) which is not a true form of the law but so many of us have bended to their criminal ways. Not me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSovereign Citizens and Law Enforcement\n\nPolice sometimes stop sovereign citizens who believe that they are being harassed unjustly by uninformed officers. During a post after her March traffic stop, Gaines identified the police as \"kidnappers\" and noted that she was being \"held hostage\" while in police custody.\n\nSovereigns believe that judges, courts and police officers no longer have jurisdiction over them. They often consider police \"harassers\" and clog up the court system filing frivolous lawsuits citing archaic and, oftentimes, asinine statutes. This is sometimes referred to as \"paper terrorism.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen A. Crockett Jr. is a senior editor at The Root.

Another police officer has walked away without repercussions after gunning down a black man. On Friday morning, a St. Louis judge found now-former Police Officer Jason Stockley not guilty of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, a black motorist.\n\nSt. Louis had waited with bated breath, restless and on edge, as it awaited the judge\u2019s ruling, as CNN notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruling, handed down by St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson, ultimately read: \u201cThis court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.\u201d\n\nStockley, who was then on the police force, shot Smith, a 24-year-old father, after a police chase in December 2011.\n\nStockley, as to be expected, claimed that he had acted in self-defense, saying he believed that Smith was reaching for a weapon in the car. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and waived his right to a jury trial, instead preferring to stand before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors accused him of planting the gun in Smith\u2019s car in order to justify the shooting, pointing out that Stockley\u2019s DNA was found on the gun, but not Smith\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed with the court\u2019s finding,\u201d Circuit Judge Kim Gardner, whose office prosecuted the case, said in a release, according to Newsweek. \u201cI know there are better ways we can do this if we join together to make the system work for us all.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s family is expected to hold a press conference later Friday morning.\n\nAs Newsweek notes, protesters vowed that \u201cthere [would] be unrest\u201d in the city if the verdict ended up being not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Smith\u2019s fiancee, Christina Wilson, spoke at a press conference with the governor Thursday, urging protesters to remain peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe might not get what we want,\u201d Wilson said at the time. \u201cBut however it goes, I ask for peace on behalf of my daughter, on Anthony\u2019s loved ones, and if you feel like you want to speak out, speak how you feel. Just do it in a peaceful way.\u201d\n\nGov. Eric Greitens echoed Wilson\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI want every Missourian to listen to Christina\u2019s words,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that people will feel pain and hurt. But please, for Christina\u2019s sake, and for her daughter\u2019s sake, do not turn that pain into violence. One life has been lost in this case, and we don\u2019t need more bloodshed. We need peace, we need love, we need understanding and we need compassion for one another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI ask every Missourian to please follow Christina\u2019s courageous and compassionate example,\u201d Greitens continued. \u201cWhatever the verdict is, we will protect every single person\u2019s right to peacefully protest. And whatever the verdict is, we\u2019ll also protect people\u2019s lives, their homes and our communities.\u201d\n\nPolice, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, have been preparing for the fallout, with barricades going up around the Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Thursday, and the St. Louis and St. Louis County police are preparing to have officers on 12-hour shifts Friday.\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2011, Stockley attempted to stop Smith after a suspected drug transaction. When Smith did not stop, a high-speed chase began. The then-officer shot at Smith\u2019s car during the chase, apparently screaming, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill this motherfucker, don\u2019t you know it!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, during the chase, the police vehicle crashed. Stockley got out armed with a service pistol and an AK-47, which he had against the Police Department\u2019s orders, and walked up to Smith\u2019s car firing five times at point-blank range with his pistol.\n\nNo witness could testify that they saw Smith with a weapon, and yet mysteriously, a .38 revolver that did not have Smith\u2019s DNA showed up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, yet, this is the justice that was served. And once again, St. Louis will be left confused, betrayed, shellshocked and more than likely enraged. Whether or not the protests will boil over remains to be seen.", "keywords": ["death", "louis", "st", "shooting", "verdict", "chase", "jason", "guilty", "need", "wilson", "car", "lamar", "stockley", "smiths", "cop", "smith"], "polarity": 0.1021953405017921, "subjectivity": 0.5783922171018945},

Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund was conceptualized \u201cto promote the education of deserving undergraduate students who enroll full time at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\u201d\n\nAs The Root previously reported, 15-year-old Jordan, two of his brothers and their friends were leaving a house party on April 29, 2017, when Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver pointed his rifle at the car full of teens and opened fire, fatally shooting Jordan in the head.\n\nOliver was eventually fired and indicted on murder charges, but not before Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber attempted to justify Jordan\u2019s extrajudicial killing. Haber initially claimed that the car in which Jordan was traveling was \u201cbacking down the street toward officers in an aggressive manner,\u201d which prompted Oliver to open fire.\n\nHaber later admitted during a press conference that he lied \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cAfter reviewing the video, I don\u2019t believe that [the fatal shooting] met our core values,\u201d Haber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan, a freshman honor student and athlete at Mesquite High School, dreamed of attending the University of Alabama and playing football for the Crimson Tide. Oliver ended those dreams with a single bullet, but Jordan\u2019s legacy will not die.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,\u201d the scholarship\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan. ... It will be the duty of the scholarship recipients to carry on a legacy of hope in Jordan\u2019s name, hope for a better, diverse tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen Brandon P. Bell, who plays the character Troy in Dear White People, heard Jordan\u2019s story, he connected with the teen on a visceral level and knew that he had to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was motivated by frustration. I\u2019m from Dallas, so I have that connection, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Bell said in an interview with The Root.\n\n\u201cI read about Jordan\u2019s story and was on the verge of tears. I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do it specifically for the family,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo I reached out to them to see how they wanted to honor Jordan\u2019s legacy, and they wanted to do that through education. Everything started from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarque Richardson, who plays Reggie on Dear White People, has been with Bell every step of the way in seeing this scholarship fund come to fruition. He also traveled with Bell to Texas to meet Jordan\u2019s family.\n\n\n\n\u201cUA was Jordan\u2019s dream school, but his life\u2014and the opportunity to realize his dreams\u2014was stolen from him and his family,\u201d Richardson told The Root.\n\nBoth Bell and Richardson said that the scholarship fund was created to give students the opportunity to live out their dreams because Jordan no longer can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the scholarship specifies that funds will be awarded to \u201cdeserving students,\u201d Bell made it clear that \u201cdeserving\u201d is about much more than grades and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concept of being deserving is so vast,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about how someone looks on paper, not just their GPA. But do they represent who Jordan was as a person? Do they understand\u2014or are they trying to learn\u2014about the systemic oppression that creates the environment where Jordan\u2019s death can take place?\n\n\u201cThe family created an essay question for the scholarship, and it really reflects the heart of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichardson agreed, adding that supporting students and helping them navigate a racist society is critical.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help pave the way so that our leaders of tomorrow have the tools they need to create the change we need,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to take it to the streets, but we also have to have people in positions to influence policy and legislation, to change the world on an institutional level. That\u2019s what this scholarship is about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to create space for our children to be supported in the fullness of their humanity,\u201d Richardson continued. \u201cWe have to do what we can do to help them reach their goals. They deserve that. This scholarship fund is an entity that will last forever, and it\u2019s one more tool that, at its core, can be used to keep our people alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The Root, civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt, who represents the Edwards family, said, \u201cThe murder of Jordan Edwards represented not only a tragic loss to his family, but his death robbed our community of a valuable resource of potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis scholarship fund is an ingenious mechanism for beginning to make up for that great loss, but it can\u2019t end here,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cWe are pushing to get police reform legislation passed in Jordan\u2019s name, a football stadium dedicated to his memory and above all a historical conviction in the Texas Criminal Courts for his murderer, Roy Oliver.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs college costs continue to rise, Bell said that it was also important to him to lift the economic burden from students\u2019 shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without the support of the community, cast, and Jordan\u2019s love of life guiding the way,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI have learned that we must rely on each other for support.\u201d\n\nClick here to donate to the Jordan J.

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get, like, the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are\u2014all the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... you know I had a lot of work to do with getting past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie, because I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I kind of felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "hannah", "panther", "production", "beachler", "different", "told", "black", "designer", "studiosdisney", "marvel", "walks", "africa", "know", "important"], "polarity": 0.13435254680384556, "subjectivity": 0.5247883285545621},

The footage shows officers opening fire on a mentally ill Bronx, N.Y., man holding a knife after police repeatedly warn him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, NYPD officers were called to Miguel Richards\u2019 apartment in the Bronx by his landlord, who had requested a wellness check. Upon arriving, police said they found Richards in the corner of his room. The lights were out and Richards was wearing sunglasses, holding a knife in one hand, with his right hand behind his back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his other hand was a toy gun, which Richards would later raise at the police, authorities say. One cop shot his stun gun at Richards; two others opened fire, killing him.\n\nThe NYPD released each of the videos captured from the four responding officers\u2019 body cameras. The department also shared a 17-minute compilation of all the footage compiled, which we\u2019ve included below. In total, seven videos were released.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Video contains graphic footage.\n\nThroughout the standoff, the footage shows, the 31-year-old Richards says nothing and appears expressionless, though the flashlights make it hard to see his features at several points in the video. He also doesn\u2019t appear to comply with officers, who repeatedly ask him to drop the knife. In total, BuzzFeed News counted 44 times the officers beseeched Richards to drop his weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, an officer is heard saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot you, but I will if you don\u2019t drop that knife.\u201d\n\nRichards\u2019 landlord and two friends, who were at the scene, also beg him to comply with the cops.\n\n\u201cDude, put your hands up!\u201d one of them yells. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d\n\nBut the standoff escalates once Richards raises the toy gun at the cops, who indicate that they aren\u2019t sure if the gun is real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne officer, whom DNAinfo identified as Mark Fleming, calls out to Richards: \u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot you if you\u2019ve got a fake gun in your hand, you hear me? But I will shoot you if that\u2019s a real gun.\u201d\n\nOfficers end up firing 16 shots at Richards.\n\nWith the footage made public, speculation will certainly fly over whether officers could have done more to de-escalate the situation, especially considering Richards\u2019 mental condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudies in recent years show that those with mental disabilities are 16 times more likely to be killed by police. A Washington Post report from 2015 found that a quarter of the people shot by officers that year were mentally ill.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, the NYPD starting equipping its officers with body cameras in April of this year as part of a pilot program to increase transparency.\n\nBy the end of the year, an expected 1,200 NYPD cops will be equipped with the technology, according to Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill.", "keywords": ["mentally", "video", "man", "drop", "knife", "shooting", "officers", "releases", "gun", "hand", "shoot", "bronx", "nypd", "richards", "showing", "ill", "footage"], "polarity": 0.013805465367965366, "subjectivity": 0.4573029401154401},

We mentioned this scenario was an obvious one for the show to tackle, but spoiler warning just in case.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment in the premiere where Pierce is unjustly stopped by the police. He\u2019s forced to choose between standing up for himself and risking being shot in front of his daughters in the car or following the officers\u2019 directions, knowing the only reason he\u2019s been stopped is that he\u2019s black.\n\nAs universal as the scene is, it was deeply personal for Akil\u2014who, speaking to The New York Times, described his own experiences being repeatedly harassed by different police officers within a relatively short amount of time:\n\n\u201cI had been stopped by the police quite a few times, but my anger in being stopped again was about to get me killed.

What was so different in this situation? If they truly felt like something was wrong with her, then address her accordingly,\" one of Gaines' aunts, Dawn McGee, said.\n\n\"She was sitting on the floor. The weapon was on her lap beside her.

The boy was hit during the shooting that left his mother dead.\n\n\"He wasn't a hostage. He wasn't a hostage. She would never do that. Before she would hurt her baby, she would jump in front of a bullet for him. She would not hurt her kids, and for them to keep portraying her as that kind of person is awful,\" Shannon Gaines said.\n\nAccording to WBAL-TV, there is no police body-camera footage of what happened inside the apartment. Korryn Gaines was recording portions of the incident and posting the video to her Instagram account, until police got Facebook (which owns Instagram) to remove the video from the online platform. The family also took issue with that action, blasting it as an attempt to silence the young mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Because she was broadcasting it to people who cared about her. They had to make her feel alienated, and they had to assassinate her right there with her baby sitting right there, and try to paint it like she's the one that was wrong. She's the one that was crazy. It is not right,\" Shannon Gaines insisted.\n\nPolice said they asked that Korryn Gaines' social media be deactivated because people were egging her on, WBAL-TV reports.\n\nKorryn Gaines had posted to Facebook Monday during the standoff, writing, \"Don't tell me what to do. I'm home.

Minnesota prosecutors also decided whether to bring charges in the officer-involved deaths of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamond was killed July 15 in Minneapolis after calling 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home. The Guardian reports that as Damond approached the driver\u2019s side of the squad car, the officers heard a \u201cloud noise.\u201d In response, Office Mohamed Noor shot Damond from the passenger side of the vehicle, killing her.\n\nDamond\u2019s death sparked international headlines. The Australian life coach had been deemed \u201cthe most innocent victim\u201d by her family\u2019s lawyer, and the scandal around her shooting prompted Minneapolis police chief Jane\u00e9 Harteau to resign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNoor has not spoken publicly about the case, and a CNN article from July 19 reports that the officer had declined to be interviewed by investigators.\n\nNow his fate lies in the hands of Hennepin County, Minn., Attorney Mike Freeman, who says he expects his office to decide charges before the end of the year. According to The Guardian, Freeman had previously declined to bring charges in the death of Jamar Clark in 2015. In that case, the 24-year-old Clark was shot and killed by police officers who were responding to a domestic violence call. Witness accounts say that Clark was handcuffed and on the ground when he was shot, while police claim that Clark was interfering with them as they tried to help the assault victim. Officers reported that he had been trying to reach for their weapon when they shot him above his eye.\n\nThe Department of Justice also failed to bring charges against the officers who killed Clark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the decision to forgo a grand jury is significant. Legal experts and activists have long criticized the practice of having grand juries decide whether or not to bring charges against police officers in fatal shootings, pointing out that the process, by and large, favors the police. Some of the criticisms include the secrecy of grand jury trials, which happen behind closed doors and without cross-examination, and the prolonged process.\n\nEven Minnesota attorney Freeman has said as much. From The Guardian:\n\nFreeman noted at the time of Clark\u2019s death that grand juries had been used to consider police shootings in his county for more than 40 years, and no officers had been indicted. He said by making the decision himself there would be more accountability and transparency.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at CBS News and The Guardian.", "keywords": ["charges", "officer", "death", "justine", "juryto", "officers", "killed", "minn", "bring", "consider", "grand", "prosecutornot", "clark", "damond", "shot", "reports"], "polarity": 0.11868386243386242, "subjectivity": 0.40889550264550256},

A bystander\u2019s video showed officers manhandling, punching and choking the Cameroonian man. There is only one thing that every party agrees on:\n\nAn officer of the LAPD shot and killed Charly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang.\n\nIt seems like it would be an easy thing to clear up. At least three officers on the scene were outfitted with body cameras that captured the incident. But for three years the city of Los Angeles refused to release the footage, until the Los Angeles Times, after a lengthy court battle, obtained the videos from those bodycams on Tuesday.\n\nThe videos show Keunang standing in front of his tent arguing with policemen as Francisco Martinez, an officer who Skid Row residents called a \u201chard-ass bitch cop,\u201d threatens to shoot Keunang with a Taser. Keunang goes back inside his tent and tells the officers to \u201cleave me alone.\u201d As Keunang exits his tent again, the video shows Martinez tasing him. At least three officers pounce on him.

Killmonger definitely isn\u2019t \u201cgood,\u201d but he isn\u2019t entirely \u201cbad,\u201d either.\n\nHe\u2019s human, and he\u2019s got a motivation and perspective that Black Panther wants you to sit with and contemplate long after the second post-credit scene sequence ends. Killmonger is a very much a narrative villain who does the sort of things that bad guys do, but at the same time he\u2019s a person you can see yourself in all too clearly when you put yourself in his shoes.\n\nKillmonger has a perfectly understandable reason for harboring a deep resentment for the Wakandan royal family and, to a point, the country itself. Early in the film, we learn through a flashback that Killmonger\u2019s father N\u2019Jobu, a Wakandan prince-turned-spy embedded in Oakland, California, chose to betray Wakanda.\n\nBy partnering with Ulysses Klaue to steal vibranium from Wakanda, N\u2019Jobu strongly believed that he would have been able to set off a revolution designed to bring an end to Wakanda\u2019s isolationist politics, something he felt was for the greater good. To N\u2019Jobu, Wakanda\u2019s culture of secrecy and its noninterference in the affairs of other countries were a kind of social negligence that contributed to the oppression of black people across the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepending on how you look at it, N\u2019Jobu has a very, very good point. While present-day Wakanda is meant to be something on the order of 20 to 25 years ahead of the rest of the world, the implication is that in the past, the country was centuries ahead of its peers and thus was in a position to change the course of history\u2014especially as it relates to the African diaspora. N\u2019Jobu impressed these ideas upon his son and told Erik about the technological might of his home country, and the origins of their family tree. T\u2019Chaka\u2019s ultimate decision to execute N\u2019Jobu for his treason is understandable, but so too is the rage that his father\u2019s death sparks in Erik\u2014a rage amplified by the fact that T\u2019Chaka abandons his young, newly-orphaned nephew behind in America.\n\nImagine knowing that you were descended from the royalty of an African country that had the power to upend the racial hierarchies that brutalized other black people across the world. Not only that, but when presented with the opportunity to go back to that country, your very own family made a point of rejecting you in an effort to protect itself. You would feel hurt and lost, and most likely filled with a deep-seated rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik\u2019s predicament is the perfect crystallization of the inevitable tragedy that comes with fantasizing about a place like Wakanda where black people are truly free and unburdened by the impacts of institutionalized racism. Wakanda\u2019s very existence means that, for Erik, there\u2019s always a place where he could and would thrive in ways that he can barely imagine, but rather than being welcomed there, he\u2019s cast out and left to fend for himself. Erik is a stand-in for all of us who want to be part of Wakanda, even though Wakanda doesn\u2019t want part of anything else but itself. That\u2019s the harsh, canon reality of the Wakanda from Marvel\u2019s comics. The country is better off than the rest of the world and it is the kind of place where black people could flourish and prosper, but the Wakandans choose to keep to themselves, albeit for a number of obvious and valid reasons.\n\n\n\nThe enthusiasm with which we (and by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean black people) celebrate Wakanda is, in a way, somewhat at odds with the painful realities that would come along with the existence of such a country\u2014like the fact that they simply don\u2019t welcome outsiders. But there are heavier questions at hand as well. Where was Wakanda during the centuries when Western countries institutionalized the enslavement of Africans from other nations, during the Civil Rights era, or when other movements focused on the agitation for black equality?\n\nFrom both N\u2019Jobu and Killmonger\u2019s perspectives, the whole history of black pain and suffering at the hands of those who see us as less than is something that Wakanda could have changed if it chose to, but it didn\u2019t. Those who suffered and suffer have a right to be angry, and if you were in the same position as they were, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019d feel the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther poses these questions to its heroes in such a way that makes clear that the film doesn\u2019t wholly see Killmonger as a villain. He\u2019s grappling with a multigenerational grief over what could have been, both for him and black people as a global community; it makes sense that he would see seizing the throne as an opportunity to begin righting the wrongs that have hurt him so deeply.\n\n\n\nAs a concept, Wakanda\u2019s a vastly different place than when it was first introduced in Marvel\u2019s comics back in 1966. As more and more black fans and comics creators have come to love and create new stories for the Black Panther, Wakanda\u2019s become so much more than a thought experiment about what an African country would be like if it\u2019d been untouched and unconquered by colonizers. The Wakanda we celebrate in our excited conversations about Black Panther is a love letter to the African continent, those of us who carry it with us in our blood, and wear it on our skin. It\u2019s the Wakanda that N\u2019Jobu likely told Erik stories about when he was a young boy\u2014a wondrous place where his talents and potential would never be squandered or extinguished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger\u2019s story is tragic, but Black Panther expertly frames it as the ideal opportunity to confront the difficult questions we\u2019ve all asked ourselves about Wakanda. He\u2019s far from perfect\u2014indeed, he\u2019s a vicious killer. But he isn\u2019t exactly a villain, either. He\u2019s human and fragile and trying to work through a constellation of difficult, agonizing feelings. He\u2019s all of us.", "keywords": ["wakanda", "wakandas", "love", "panther", "loves", "njobu", "place", "hes", "country", "panthers", "black", "killmonger", "erik", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.07748868998869003, "subjectivity": 0.5189931164931162},

This is, part and parcel, why I have no issue with being Team #AbolishThePolice. However, it is the former that hurts more than the latter. The fact that when I log on to the internet and find my way through the Twittersphere, I see black men blaming black women like Gaines\u2014the same black women who defend us even to their detriment\u2014hurts like hell.\n\nAlthough men often remain silent about the violence black women face, black women continually fight for and defend black men. How often do we organize national marches for black women killed by police? Let\u2019s face it: Black women rarely receive respect in movement-building spaces, including online mechanisms, despite always being front and center in ongoing fights against police brutality. It\u2019s quite terrifying to have anyone think that women like Gaines are the causes of their own deaths. And having that cruel argument come from black men adds insult to injury.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t escape me that the world needs more people like Gaines: women who are bold, women who don\u2019t want to die with their hands up because they understand that they can be shot anyhow, and women who are about transformative justice. Gaines recognized that none of this could be done with concession. This, coupled with the understanding that black America doesn\u2019t need to sanitize Gaines\u2019 life for us to #SayHerName, is critical. Gaines fought (and fought hard), and she wanted to ensure that her son understood not to fear police. But still, none of this means she deserved to die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, what we know is that if Gaines had been white, she would have lived. The main argument circulating is that \u201cshe asked to die when she pointed the gun at police.\u201d Assuming she actually pointed a gun, we must understand that her blackness is what got her killed, not a rifle.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been numerous occasions when white people have pointed guns at police officers and have remained alive\u2014and, in some instances, have kept their firearms. E.J. Watson, for example, was arrested in October of 2015 for waving a loaded gun on the road, and when the police came, he did not put it down. He\u2019s still living. And this year, the police approached a vehicle of Jed Frazier, a white man, as he pulled a handgun from his coat pocket and pointed it at police. He\u2019s not dead.\n\nWhile we may not know too much about Gaines, we do know police. We do know that we need to continue to #SayHerName if black women are to mean anything to us and our movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we know that the body count of black women like Gaines who are executed by police and blamed for their own blood will continue to rise as long as we are silent about their pain, cowardly co-signing the lie that they deserved it.", "keywords": ["women", "killed", "men", "pointed", "white", "sayhername", "doesnt", "gaines", "black", "way", "korryn", "silent", "perfect", "know", "need"], "polarity": -0.02685969868173258, "subjectivity": 0.38024952919020716},

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["mother", "situation", "pain", "right", "mothers", "rest", "lives", "dormeus", "theres", "wont", "hes", "gaines", "speaks", "korryn", "child", "family", "baltimore"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts.

One (Korryn Gaines) was shot and killed by police officers during an alleged stand-off. Her five-year-old son was also shot. He is expected to survive.\n\nAnother (Joyce Quaweay) was stripped naked, handcuffed to a bench, and beaten to death by her boyfriend (Aaron Wright). Wright was assisted by his best friend (Marquis Robinson), who helped restrain Quaweay. Both men were former Temple University police officers. Also present were the children Quaweay and Wright had together, a two-year-old and a 10-month-old. One can only shudder at the thought of how brutal (and long) that beating must have been if it resulted in her death.\n\nNaturally, most of the reactions to these stories \u2014 at least the reactions I read \u2014 possessed the type of sadness and outrage you'd anticipate accompanying such tragic news.\n\nThere was also a collective exasperation, and a sadness and an outrage specifically derived from that exasperation. But this specific exasperation wasn't necessarily due to the acts themselves. It came from a frustration about the reactions to these acts.\n\nIn Gaines's case, this frustration stemmed from the observation many Black women (and some Black men) made that Gaines didn't seem to receive the same immediate benefit of the doubt and support from Black men that Black men killed by police always seem to. In Quaweay's case, the frustration stemmed from an acknowledgement of the role toxic patriarchy played in her death, and the reluctance of (some) Black men to acknowledge that it even exists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, both of these frustrations and exasperations speak to a larger and painstakingly pervasive and consistent theme. That America is a uniquely dangerous place for Black women. Even more dangerous than it is for Black men. And that far too few people \u2014 far too few Black men, specifically \u2014 care to accept and acknowledge this.\n\nNow, I can cite myriad statistics and studies to express why this - that America is a uniquely dangerous place for Black women \u2014 is true. Proof is not very difficult to find. Articulating the reasonings behind the disconnect between the general accepted narrative and the reality, however, is a bit more complex. So complex that the best way for me to make some sense of it is to get personal; for me to explain why this disconnect existed within me too.\n\nAs long as I can remember being aware of race, racism, and the type of violence (both racial and general) that's featured in the news, Black men have been the faces of it. When learning at home and in school about the fight for civil rights, while I was taught that while Black women and girls definitely played a prominent role in that battle, it was Black men like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and Medger Evers who were assassinated and martyred. It was Black boys like Emmett Till who were murdered by White men; Black men like Jesse Washington who were lynched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as a teen in the 90s, when police-involved and gang/drug-related violence dominated our news, Black men were the faces of that too. It was Black men like Rodney King who became national stories after being beaten by the police, and Black men like Jonny Gammage who were killed by them. It was (mostly) Black men killed in drive-bys and neighborhood feuds; in gang wars and tragic miscommunications. It was a Black male \u2014 a star football player named Dorian Reid \u2014 who was murdered my sophomore year of high school; an act that led to Peabody High School shutting down for an entire week. The people I graduated high school with who were murdered within a couple years of graduation? All Black males. One of whom was a friend killed by another one of my friends, also a Black male. As a young adult teaching at Wilkinsburg High School, it was Black boys like Chandler Thompson and Steven Tibbs \u2014 both of whom sat in my classroom \u2014 who were killed. It was Black men like my friend Kenneth Alford Jr (who everyone knew as \"Stubbo\") who were killed as a result of senseless shit like mistaken identity. And Black men like Amir Allen, who came to a birthday slumber party my parents threw for me when I was 11, serving life sentences in prison today for killing another Black man.\n\nStatistics \u2014 murder rates and incarceration rates, specifically \u2014 and the stories and news segments these statistics existed in reflected this idea of Black men existing as the most likely victims of violence and racism. Of course, Black women and girls were victimized by racial violence and murdered too. I was aware of historically prominent stories like the four little girls in Birmingham. And stories that weren't as nationally prominent, but still resonated with me, like the circumstances surrounding 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins's death in a Buffalo suburb in 1995. And of the several students I taught who had been murdered, one (18-year-old Richiena Porter) was a Black girl.\n\nBut these instances were generally treated as anomalies \u2014 things that generally just didn't happen to Black women very often \u2014 so I believed them to be. And internalized that. And with this internalization came the idea that, when thinking of the dangers that Black people are disproportionately affected by, murder rates and incarceration rates were the ones that mattered most.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while we (Black men) are more likely to get murdered or face imprisonment than Black women are, each still happens to Black women at very high rates. And the number of Black men actually affected by this is still considerably lower than the number of Black women victimized by the types of violence that doesn't always make the news and doesn't always have extensive data collected on. Namely, sexual assaults and partner-related violence.\n\nNow, it's not very difficult to conclude why (some) Black men might wish to minimize the existence and effect of this type of violence. Instead of allowing us (Black men) to exist as the primary victims, we have to share that status and also accept that, in regards to the violence Black women face, we're the primary victimizers. \"Fighting the Power\" is a hollow concept if you just want to switch from a White male patriarchy to a Black male one. Accepting that is a very difficult pill to swallow. Especially after decades of considering yourself uniquely endangered.\n\nBut with me, specifically, something else happened. Something that I suspect happened (and continues to happen) with other Black men. Something that I know will sound awkward reading, because I'm still not quite sure how to articulate it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've been aware of the dangers specific to women. But it took years for me to understand it as pervasive. Not because I didn't want to, but because it just wasn't real to me. If you're a person (like me) who never witnessed this type of violence in the home or his family, and never committed any acts of violence or abuse \u2014 physical, sexual, or emotional \u2014 towards women, there's a good chance you've never actually seen it. You've read about it, seen movies about it, and perhaps even heard stories about it, but its difficult to recognize something as pervasive if it doesn't seem to exist in your life.\n\nOf course, doesn't \"seem\" to exist is an important distinction here. If half of women have been victimized in this way at some point in their lives, it stands to reason that half of my homegirls, female classmates, girlfriends, female work colleagues, and female family members have been too. It definitely existed, despite my ignorance to it.\n\nBut it didn't become real to me until two things happened. First, three separate women I've known as an adult confided in me about being assaulted \u2014 something (the confiding) that never happened to me before. Each of these were women I wouldn't have guessed had something like that happen to them, which reinforced the pervasiveness and the idea that it can happen to anyone. And also forced me to acknowledge some problematic and inaccurate thoughts about what \"victims\" looked and acted like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut also, to be quite honest, the internet happened. Namely personal blogs and digital magazines and places like Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr. Before the internet, there just weren't this many first-person stories available for public consumption. And definitely not as much easily searchable data. But now, for anyone with a wifi connect or even a smart phone, there's no excuse to not at least be aware. Even if you (wrongly) suspect these issues aren't as pervasive as you've heard they are, ask Google. And Google will change that perception in 0.000001 seconds.\n\nIf, of course, you want it to.", "keywords": ["happened", "acknowledging", "america", "women", "accepting", "dangerous", "school", "killed", "place", "men", "violence", "black", "high", "murdered", "rates", "uniquely"], "polarity": -0.0018017028993360298, "subjectivity": 0.4458419345283247},

President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the death of Army Sgt. LaDavid Johnson; the White House\u2019s silence on the killing of Army 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III by a white supremacist; and the deafening silence about racism at the U.S. Air Force Academy are just a few examples in the last year.\n\nIt is often worse for black women in the armed forces who are victims of racial and sexual violence. Consider the case of LaVena Johnson, who, at 19 years old, was found dead of a gunshot wound in a tent in Balad, Iraq. Yet despite her body being found with a broken nose, a black eye, loose teeth and corrosive chemicals found on her genitals, the Army determined that her death was a suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere else in the world are black women\u2019s bodies, even when dedicated to the protection of a nation, so degraded or devalued? Apparently, the Israeli government isn\u2019t far behind America.\n\nFeb. 21 will mark the three-year anniversary of 19-year-old Cpl. Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s death, the first African-American woman to die in the Israeli Defense Forces. Radcliffe was found dead at Palmachim Airbase just south of Tel Aviv, Israel, from a gunshot wound to the head. In early February, the IDF ruled that Radcliffe\u2019s case will not be reopened. Investigators ruled that the gunshot that went through her forehead and came out the back was a result of an accidental or intentional suicide. However, Radcliffe\u2019s family and members of the African Hebrew Israelite community aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToveet Radcliffe was born in Israel to African-American parents who moved to there to practice as Hebrew Israelites, an Afrocentric form of Old Testament Judaism. She grew up happy and popular in the southern Israeli city of Dimona, where about 10 percent of the population are Hebrew Israelites, and she was known for her beauty and gregarious personality.\n\n\n\nDespite being born in Israel, Radcliffe was not a practicing Hebrew Israelite; nor was she an Israeli citizen. In fact, Hebrew Israelites are not automatically granted Israeli citizenship; the Israeli government had tried to kick them out of the country for years (part of a larger problem of the Israeli government\u2019s discrimination against African and African-American Jews) until eventually granting them a tenuous residency status. Hebrew Israelites often live as second-class citizens, denied public education and state health care because their practice of Judaism isn\u2019t \u201corthodox.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, children can earn citizenship for themselves, and their families can become eligible to apply for full citizenship after serving a tour in the armed forces. Radcliffe joined the military in October 2013 and died barely a year into her service\u2014not from terrorists or criminals but from a bullet wound to the head while sitting in a guard booth.\n\nShe was found just after midnight, bleeding from a head wound, by the soldier who was to replace her on duty; she was declared dead by a military doctor less than half an hour later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter almost three years of legal wrangling, Judge Major Meir Vigiser ruled it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that no other person was with Radcliffe when she was shot. Vigiser rejected several experts presented by the Radcliffe family suggesting foul play, instead placing the young woman\u2019s death in her own hands.\n\nAbout 30 members of the Hebrew Israelite community, all wearing white, sat in the courtroom for over an hour, listening to Vigiser\u2019s ruling. Radcliffe\u2019s mother, Khydijah Gray, refused to attend the final hearing because she doubted that justice would come. While the verdict clearly disappointed the Radcliffe family and its supporters, it did not shock them.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely not surprised. I would have been surprised if they had done the right thing,\u201d Shayarah Baht Yisrael said to The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the whole investigation was flawed from the beginning. And that alone is jail time, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The fact that they tried to sweep it under the rug so quickly, I\u2019m very, very frustrated by that,\u201d Ketreyah Fouch said.\n\nAs supporters from the community trailed out of the Bar Lev Base, one young woman told The Root: \u201cToveet was too good to serve in the Israeli army, in general. Like all of us, we\u2019re just too good to serve in this army.\u201d\n\nHours after attending the court session, African Hebrew activist Ashriel Ben-Israel uploaded a video to Facebook calling the verdict \u201ca big embarrassment\u201d: \u201cWe do not accept it, this decision! We no longer believe any army representative regarding this case,\u201d Ben-Israel bellowed in Hebrew, overcome with emotion. \u201cWe will not allow this decision to pass in silence,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscrepancies in the IDF\u2019s account of her death disturbed Radcliffe\u2019s family and friends from the start. On Jan. 18, 2016, nearly a year after the fatal incident, the IDF published the results of its internal investigation into Radliffe\u2019s death\u2014essentially suicide. At the most basic level, it is hard to believe that 5-foot-2-inch Toveet Radcliffe managed to shoot herself through the forehead with an M4 (demonstrated below with a paper replica by her sister).\n\nGiven that the Israeli government offered to pay the Radcliffe family a lifelong stipend (for a solider who committed suicide), the questionable investigation (significant physical evidence was never examined), and the dismissal of key witnesses and testimony, Radcliffe\u2019s family sought the truth. The Hebrew Israelite community raised funds for a legal appeal that bore fruit a year later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn March 17, 2017, the president of the IDF Court of Appeals, Maj. Gen. Doron Feiles, ordered a reinvestigation of Radcliffe\u2019s death. In his decision, Feiles conceded that the IDF had not definitively demonstrated that Radcliffe had committed suicide and had not even bothered to seriously consider any other possible explanation for her death.\n\n\u201cIt could be that the IDF felt that Toveet\u2019s life wasn\u2019t of value on the scale of social importance. Maybe in its opinion, she was just a girl from a black community in Dimona, just some unimportant girl,\u201d the community leadership said the day after the Vigiser verdict in a press release. \u201cTaking into account the apathy, arrogance and total lack of transparency on the part of the IDF, it must be seen as suspect No. 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadcliffe\u2019s case had become a national story in Israel over the last few year; it was featured in several CSI/The First 48-style TV investigative shows. Yet despite the historic nature of a black girl with African-American parents dying mysteriously in the IDF, it received little or no coverage in the United States. No major news stories, no #SayHerName hashtags. A Change.org petition to President Barack Obama in 2016 on her behalf couldn\u2019t muster 1,000 signatures.\n\nWith the case officially over, members of the Hebrew Israelite community vow that they will continue the fight even if it\u2019s unclear how that will occur. The Israeli government can delay, deny or possibly void the citizenship of community members who push back too hard. Furthermore, with little or no international attention or pressure, \u00e0 la #BringBackOurGirls, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the conservative Benjamin Netanyahu government would even care.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean her case doesn\u2019t matter; it only means that if black lives truly matter across the globe, we must add Toveet Radcliffe\u2019s name to the sadly growing list of black people betrayed, abandoned and possibly killed by their governments.", "keywords": ["case", "woman", "death", "idf", "radcliffes", "community", "sayhername", "toveet", "isnt", "black", "israeli", "hebrew", "suicide", "ruled", "radcliffe", "military", "family"], "polarity": -0.026468473655973653, "subjectivity": 0.42963757179034956},

Police say that she had the 5-year-old boy in her arms and was holding a long gun, which, police say, she pointed at one of the officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus began an hourslong negotiation, police say.\n\n\"During that dialogue and conversation, she repeatedly pointed a long gun at the police officers,\" Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson told the Sun.\n\nSeveral hours later, at around 3 p.m., Gaines pointed the long gun at police officers again and told them that if they didn't leave, \"she was going to kill them,\" Johnson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's when an officer fired once at Gaines, and she fired back several times, the police chief said.

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here, too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people were paying close attention to actors of South and East African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see every day\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of Africanness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sports radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by, but still, Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help shedding a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["wakanda", "panther", "audiences", "movie", "film", "african", "told", "knew", "africans", "black", "humanizing", "hail", "going", "characters", "africa"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

And while you didn\u2019t go full Wakandan cosplay for the premiere, you did wear all black. Even copped a beret from the beret-copping store. And of course, you loved the film. Couldn\u2019t stop raving about it. Even plan to see it again next weekend.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend, whom you saw it with, loved it, too. And she\u2019s also planning to see it again. Not with you, though\u2014with her girlfriends. They planned an entire evening, actually. The movie and then group massages. Which is great, you guess, that women are also very interested in Black Panther. And understandable, with the strong female characters and feminist themes throughout the film.

She is a real, down-home patriot. So much so that she unwittingly promoted Russian-coordinated events on Facebook in support of Donald Trump. Goldfarb, who runs the Team Trump Broward County Facebook page, was one of the 53 percent of white women who backed Trump in 2016 and likely didn\u2019t need Russia\u2019s help to do it. But CNN reports that she did, in fact, promote pro-Trump events that were encouraged by Russian trolls on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they were involved or not,\u201d she told a CNN reporter when confronted about her involvement in Russia-backed events organized by the Being Patriotic Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s the least important thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo a foreign adversary meddles in the U.S. elections and uses you in the process, yet you are patriotic? OK, Becky. OK.\n\nWhen the reporter told her the group was Russian-backed, she denied it\u2014after saying she didn\u2019t care if Russia was involved or not. \u201cI don\u2019t go with the Russians,\u201d she said. Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters. That\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events. They simply found real Trump supporters and backed their cause. CNN reported that Goldfarb and other Trump backers in Florida were duped into believing they were communicating electronically and over the phone with other Trump supporters. Often, they were speaking to Russians willing to offer financial and logistical support.\n\nOne of the people tricked into believing the Being Patriotic Facebook page\u2014which was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St. Petersburg, Russia (who also had 13 of its members indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller)\u2014was Harry Miller. He was paid \u201c$1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person with whom Miller spoke on the phone didn\u2019t speak fluent English. Figuring the person was a first-generation immigrant, Miller\u2019s suspicions weren\u2019t set off.\n\n\u201cThey had that beautiful website, were very supportive of the candidate and there was nothing, nothing at all that lends you to think it was anything other that people trying to support a candidate,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nWell, at least Miller seems to believe he was tricked.\n\nGoldfarb? Not so much. When the CNN reporter probed her about her communications with Russians connected to Being Patriotic, she denied it and said, \u201cHillary Clinton was and so was her bandits, Mueller.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBandit is not a term you hear in the American vernacular every day, but it is commonly used to describe criminals in Russia. Even in Ukraine, where I visit often, the word \u201cbandit\u201d is commonly used to describe criminals. I highly suspect that while Goldfarb may not have met with Russians in person, she may have picked up the word from conversing with Russians electronically or over the phone.

Masterfully produced and directed by DuVernay, it is a poignant documentary detailing white America\u2019s continual, desperate and ever-changing attempts to maintain racial and legal domination over black people.\n\nWhat has emerged as common knowledge through the Movement for Black Lives is laid out clearly and plainly in the film: Mass incarceration and modern-day policing are mutations of American slavery that mean to maintain the economic, social, political and legal subjugation of black people to support the (white) American enterprise.\n\nHailed as one of the most important films of the year, 13th evokes the eponymous 13th Amendment, which simultaneously emancipated enslaved Africans and laid the groundwork for their continued confinement and the forced extraction of labor from their bodies through convict leasing, Jim Crow and, more recently, \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing and the war on drugs. The abolition of slavery, \u201cexcept as a punishment for crime,\u201d is an insidious loophole in the 13th Amendment that provides an instructive framework from which audiences can better understand today\u2019s crisis of mass incarceration: The U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and a quarter of the world\u2019s prisoners.\n\n13th boasts an impressive slate of organizers, historians, advocates, scholars and formerly incarcerated people who tell the origin story and contemporary impact of America\u2019s hypercriminalization of black people, including the power of media to create narratives about blackness that were so terrifying that even black America took up the mantle to cage and confine our kindred in the name of \u201claw and order.\u201d\n\nHowever, the film\u2019s power is tempered by a glaring omission: black women\u2019s stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring neither slavery nor Jim Crow nor the deceptively named war on drugs have black women been immune from the hypercriminality imposed on black people. In 2000, black women and men were incarcerated at 6 and 7.5 times (pdf) the rates of white women and men, respectively.\n\nA pivotal moment in the timeline presented by 13th is Ronald Reagan\u2019s ascendance to the presidency in 1981, when he launched his war on drugs, which was manufactured to decimate black communities and later became the foundation for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 doubly horrible crime bill.\n\nBut by centering the story of the criminalization squarely on black men, 13th invisibilizes the unique conditions that compound and give way to both cis and transgender black women\u2019s experiences in America at the intersections of racial and gender policing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, black women are the fastest-growing prison population, and this phenomenon can directly be tied into the disgraceful war on drugs that effectively criminalized people suspected of trafficking and using drugs as well as their partners, children and parents. Lest we not forget, Alberta Spruill, 57, was killed after New York City police officers broke down her door and threw a concussion grenade into her home while searching for guns and drugs that were not there.\n\n13th briefly mentions Sharanda Jones, a black woman serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a first-time drug offense, but her story is more common than is alluded to in the film. Black women are often swept into the carceral system either from being targeted by the war on drugs themselves or for little more than their relationship to partners who are being targeted by the state.\n\nSimilarly, when conversations about bail reform and the heartbreaking story of Kalief Browder\u2014a young black man who killed himself after being held for three years at New York City's Rikers Island jail for his inability to make bail\u2014emerged in the film, important insights into how black women are affected by the lack of access to fair bail hearings failed to be brought to light. Imagine being held in incarceration while waiting for trial because you can\u2019t make bail and being pregnant. Currently, 28 states still enforce \u201cshackling laws\u201d that require pregnant women to be \u201cshackled\u201d by the hands, feet, stomach or all three during childbirth\u2014a practice that has led to stillborn births, birth defects and maternal mortality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 13th remembers Reagan as the chief architect of the war on drugs, many black feminists also remember him as the creator and exploiter of the \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d a mythical black woman who defrauded the government for millions through public assistance. The welfare queen, and the conservative lore that surrounded her, gave way to a massive destabilization of welfare and the criminalization of those on public assistance.\n\nYes, black men are heavily criminalized and brutalized by police aggression, but so are black women.\n\nWe cannot talk about Trayvon Martin and not mention Renisha McBride. We cannot discuss Michael Brown and not say the name of Sandra Bland. Kayla Moore and Alfred Olango are equally important to understanding how black people are affected by state violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is critical that histories of white supremacy in America recognize that as long as there have been black women in America, the anti-blackness of the state has fashioned itself to eviscerate black women just as intentionally as it has black men.\n\nWe are more than a brief aside to black men\u2019s stories. We are, and have always been, under attack from the American carceral state. It\u2019s time to tell our stories, too. #SayOurNames.\n\nSamantha Master is a black-queer-feminist activist, educator and member of the Black Youth Project 100.

We\u2019re talking about the powerful women of the Dora Milaje and the scene-stealing M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), and we even got a new handshake to share with our folk.\n\nGIF\n\nBut as excitement reached its peak after our first look, or looks, at the blockbuster, so have cries of #TeamTChalla\u2014better known as Black Panther\u2014vs. #TeamKillmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But as hell-bent as Killmonger seems to be on black liberation, support for anti-hero/villain Killmonger (Wakandan name: N\u2019Jadaka) may be misplaced, because it clearly comes with a side of toxic masculinity.\n\nDuring my first\u2014and second\u2014viewing of the film, I was undeniably moved by Killmonger. He spoke with the pained voice of black America, a voice that\u2019s been disconnected from its African roots and stifled and silenced by centuries of oppression. One of his first lines in the film is to ask the white female curator of an African art exhibit: \u201cHow do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price for it? Or did they take them, like they took everything else?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my theater, a cheer rose from the audience of mostly black folk. When he later pointed out that Wakanda has just been chilling on the sidelines while billions of black folk around the world were suffering, I heard more than a few folks say, \u201cYasss\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He definitely had a point: Black liberation has always been a debate between tactical resistance and revolution by any means necessary. So it\u2019s not surprising that as more and more think pieces emerge, many are split between #TeamKillmonger and #TeamTChalla.\n\nBut after viewing the movie a second time, I noticed Killmonger\u2019s hella problematic approach to liberation (shoutout to Oakland, Calif.). In a movie that otherwise unabashedly celebrates black women, his actions express a deep misogynoir that begins with the killing of his nameless girlfriend and extends through his scoffing at his aunt, the regal Ramonda (Angela Bassett); choking a female elder/shaman; murdering one of the Dora Milaje; injuring Nakia; and nearly killing Shuri.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillmonger repeatedly expresses his desire to demolish white European supremacy in favor of a black empire. His analysis of the European oppressors who stole, raped and pillaged their way across the world is not inaccurate. Black people all over the world (except the fictional Wakanda) have had their asses kicked by colonialism. But even with expansive technology and wealth at his fingertips, the only way Killmonger can think to correct this is by mimicking the behavior of the colonizer. He is not merely desiring justice but is lusting for revenge. He\u2019s not on a mission for liberation; he wants annihilation. His brutality is the very embodiment of toxic masculinity.\n\nIn a movie where no character uttered the n-word and black womanhood was centered, Killmonger\u2019s violence toward women\u2014black women in particular\u2014was stark and pronounced. Is this what we think of black American men? With a black American man helming the movie, it would be troubling to think that Killmonger could be read as unilaterally representative of black American male consciousness.\n\nErik Stevens, later Killmonger, is a black male character raised in America\u2014in Oakland, to be precise, the birthplace of the actual Black Panthers. He is a fictional black child whose mother we never see on-screen, who then grows into a black man who has seen violence both personal (the murder of his father) and political (the Rodney King verdict and the Los Angeles riots).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens has presumably watched and taken notes on the political realities of America; two years after his father\u2019s death, President Bill Clinton would sign the 1994 crime bill that exponentially increased the black prison population. He escapes that fate by attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joining the CIA and becoming a political mercenary. He is a product of his upbringing, and his rage is justified.\n\nBut Black Panther presents another path to global black freedom for its audience to consider. Instead of #TeamTChalla or #TeamKillmonger, why aren\u2019t we #TeamNakia?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom almost her first appearance in Black Panther, the character of Nakia told T\u2019Challa about himself and Wakanda, that their country couldn\u2019t idly sit back and watch the world annihilate blackness. She, embracing an arguably more Afrofuturist mindset, wanted restorative justice and liberation for black people across the world\u2014not with guns but with the blessing of Wakandan aid\u2014through their expansive technology and wealth. While it\u2019s true that sometimes revolution requires that we be armed, Nakia\u2019s point of view argued that we cannot rely solely on military might to accomplish our collective goals.\n\nComparing Nakia\u2019s and Erik\u2019s visions for liberation invites us to examine our values when it comes to revolution. And while I don\u2019t agree with everything in TaLynn Kel\u2019s article \u201cAn American Monster in Wakanda,\u201d she does have a point about the complicity of everyone but the character of Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o):\n\n\n\n\ufeffNakia knew it wasn\u2019t enough, which was why she could not stay. Would not stay and in the end, should not stay. Wakanda was complicit in the genocide of millions while looking at those suffering not with compassion, but with dismissal. Wakanda Forever really meant Wakanda first and only. Ignoring genocide doesn\u2019t exempt you from responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two visions of how we get free also ask us to take a look at our views about gender and masculinity\u2014and how our own silence often equals violence. As 45 percent of ticket buyers during Black Panther\u2019s opening weekend were women, there is also a call for us to bear witness to the ways in which we\u2014especially as black women\u2014are complicit in toxic masculinity in our social movements.\n\nIn a poignant moment after they both believe that T\u2019Challa has been murdered, his general, Okoye (Danai Gurira), and Nakia confront each other. Okoye pledges to serve the throne unconditionally, while Nakia wants to save the country (and black people), but not in service to Killmonger. It\u2019s reminiscent of the ways in which some black women will unconditionally support and protect black men who are obviously dangerous to our communities (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, etc.) in favor of protecting the idea of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut liberation cannot come on the backs of black women. We have to resist glorifying the character in the story that represents a problematic bag of liberation goals. It is not enough to claim a desire to free black folk, all while murdering, assaulting and disposing of black women. It is not enough to fight for justice while undergirding it with vengeance. Liberation must be for all.\n\nI need to be clear: I love Black Panther for so many reasons, including the way that it\u2019s pushing us to have some much-needed conversations. So much of the film resonated with me, even Killmonger\u2019s poignant last words: \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. Because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d Those words burned me to my soul.\n\nAs a character, Killmonger reminded me of the oft-quoted James Baldwin: \u201cTo be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of rage.\u201d But I also know that when rage is directed solely into vengeance and not justice\u2014at the expense of black women and in the form of blind violence against them\u2014then who are we, if not mirroring our oppressors?", "keywords": ["liberation", "wakanda", "world", "character", "women", "teamkillmonger", "nakia", "hero", "worship", "teamtoxicmasculinity", "violence", "black", "killmonger", "think", "trouble"], "polarity": 0.01912185610532719, "subjectivity": 0.40012611355586547},

Under most circumstances, a failed presidential party nominee running for a Senate seat wouldn\u2019t be big news. It\u2019d be the equivalent of LeBron James retiring to become a player-coach for Duke after realizing he couldn\u2019t beat Golden State.\n\nHowever, since the 2016 presidential election, Mitt Romney has been reimagined by much of the public, and many members on the right, as some sort of moral center and lead anti-Trumpist for the Republican Party. A man willing to call out Donald Trump for his many foul and inappropriate deeds. Just check out these hits:\n\n\n\nWho can forget Romney calling Trump a phony and a fraud during the 2016 presidential election season?\n\nOr the remix version when brave Mitt Romney called President Trump a comforter and cheerleader for racists after the president\u2019s comments on the Charlottesville, Va., terror attack?:\n\nWhether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn. His apologists strain to explain that he didn\u2019t mean what we heard. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, the feeling was mutual. Donald Trump holds a lot of grudges against Mitt Romney.\n\nHe\u2019s never forgiven Romney for calling him a fraud and a phony; he was furious that prominent Republicans wanted Romney to run as a third-party candidate in 2016, and lastly, Trump probably can\u2019t get over the fact that even though they\u2019re only a year apart in age, Romney\u2019s mane is always perfectly laid while Trump\u2019s head looks like he\u2019s had more implants than Stormy Daniels.\n\nDemonstrating the penchant for pettiness that has defined his presidency, Trump spent the first few months after the election engaging in an elaborate Lucy-and-the-football scheme, with Romney doing the most-earnest Charlie Brown impression possible. And after months of publicly wining and dining Romney, Trump turned around and gave the secretary of state job to Rex Tillerson, a Russian-business crony with less experience than Romney\u2019s pre-Massachusetts r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t enough; late last year, Trump actively tried to block Romney from running for Senate. In other words, if Romney had even the slightest drop of personal integrity, or even cared about his brand as the moral opposite of Trump, or wanted to keep those rumors alive that he might actually primary Trump in 2020, he\u2019d stick to his guns like he did in 2016 right? He would run for Utah Senate as the anti-Trump or at least make it clear he was his own man.\n\nExcept no. Mitt Romney is a spineless craven politician thirsty for any semblance of relevance after America rejected his brand of disingenuous, sanctimonious leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny dreams that he would stand up to Trump (and those had to be drug-induced fantasies born of nothing more than an unrealistic faith in a politician who said 47 percent of the country wasn\u2019t worth talking to) went out the window when he tweeted this on Monday:\n\nMind you, Trump has never apologized nor changed his tune about Charlottesville; within the last week, more women have come out to accuse him of sexual improprieties; he was defending an alleged abusive spouse less than two weeks ago; and that was after he wholeheartedly endorsed a man accused of molesting teenage girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, now Romney is proud to have this endorsement that was supposedly too awful to accept two years ago. I would say that the voters of Utah deserve better, but they elected Mia Love, so there is that.\n\nI think conservatives deserve better, because if they actually want to run someone for the Senate who will at least morally stand up to Trump, they might want to nominate someone who can at least get off his hands and knees first.", "keywords": ["politician", "romney", "presidential", "week", "thirstiest", "run", "2016", "election", "senate", "americas", "mitt", "trump", "utah"], "polarity": 0.13965548340548342, "subjectivity": 0.46490800865800863},

Everyone\u2019s fixated on the screen, and the movie\u2019s jokes may get a laugh or two, but because most everyone there is there working, it\u2019s just not the same as sitting back and just having fun.\n\n\n\nLike a lot of people across the world, I saw Marvel\u2019s Black Panther multiple times this weekend because I wanted to pore deeply over the film\u2019s narrative layers and drink in the visual richness that is Wakanda. But as I hopped around from theater to theater in New York City, something else\u2014something beautiful about the movie\u2014became clear for me: The only way to really appreciate how powerful Black Panther is is to see it in a black movie theater with a predominantly black audience.\n\nBecause of how close it is to my apartment, the AMC Magic Johnson in Harlem is where I\u2019ve ended up seeing nearly every Marvel movie for the past few years, but the atmosphere in the theater this past Friday was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced there before. Long before even stepping foot inside the building, you could tell who had made their way to Harlem specifically to see Black Panther and how, for many people, the night was part of a bigger cultural event. In the light of the lobby, you could see groups of women rocking gorgeously styled geles and excitedly stanning in front of larger-than-life cutouts of Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye in her Wakandan finest.\n\nKids in panther masks weaved their way in and out of the ridiculously long line of people waiting to scan their tickets, and even though the place was hectic, you could feel just how pumped everyone was\u2014not just for the movie itself but also to be celebrating something like Black Panther in a distinctly black space.\n\nNo two audiences react to a film the exact same way, but what was enlivening about sitting in a theater full of black families and friends was the way everyone was able to fall into different rhythms with the movie while watching it together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments like T\u2019Challa\u2019s fight against M\u2019Baku atop Warrior Falls drew everyone together in support of the royal family, but you could sense a distinct divide grow in the audience as Erik Killmonger argued his case for an expansionist Wakanda. Every time the camera trained its focus on Michael B. Jordan (especially while he was shirtless), someone made a point of reminding everyone just what a vision he is to look at. But just moments later, someone on the opposite side of the theater never missed a chance to (lovingly) tut and suck their teeth in disapproval of Killmonger\u2019s extremism. Just as Black Panther was engaged in a very specific kind of dialogue with the audience, we were engaging with one another in real time\u2014a call-and-response of sorts about the story developing before our eyes.\n\nThere were more than a few scenes\u2014usually after one of Shuri\u2019s flawless zingers\u2014where the entire theater erupted into laughter that drowned out a few seconds of dialogue that no one could hear. In those moments, it didn\u2019t feel as if anyone was missing out on the movie but, rather, that as a collective, we all slipped into a comfortable familiarity with and understanding of one another that was more important than the specifics of the plot.\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s online hype is a force to be reckoned with, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture how profoundly moving it is to see rows full of little black girls and boys staring up in wonder at the Dora Milaje while they\u2019re kicking ass and taking names. They saw themselves on-screen in Black Panther\u2019s heroes and its villains, and I saw myself in them\u2014young and vibrant and inspired by the very idea of futuristic, distinctly African blackness destined to save the world from itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this was exactly the case at the screening on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side that I attended later in the weekend. The lines were just as long and the excitement was still palpable, but the sense of togetherness and kinship was missing. There were no families posing in front of the Black Panther cardboard stand-ups with their arms proudly crossed in X\u2019s over their chests, or carefully placed kente cloth accents as part of people\u2019s ensembles. I enjoyed the movie all the same, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling as if something important was missing from the experience, and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something the theater could have replicated even if it wanted to.\n\nWakanda itself may not be a real place, but the magic and wonder that Black Panther presents to us is. It\u2019s the magic and wonder that all black people know we\u2019re more than capable of creating in the world when we come together and rally behind a cause, and it\u2019s something that can never be celebrated enough. That power and sense of connectedness is the narrative foundation upon which Black Panther is built, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s best experienced in the company of other black people.", "keywords": ["world", "panther", "saw", "movie", "missing", "wonder", "black", "way", "theater", "sense", "understand", "really"], "polarity": 0.14005586164677084, "subjectivity": 0.46970079583715924},

She is a real, down-home patriot. So much so that she unwittingly promoted Russian-coordinated events on Facebook in support of Donald Trump. Goldfarb, who runs the Team Trump Broward County Facebook page, was one of the 53 percent of white women who backed Trump in 2016 and likely didn\u2019t need Russia\u2019s help to do it. But CNN reports that she did, in fact, promote pro-Trump events that were encouraged by Russian trolls on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they were involved or not,\u201d she told a CNN reporter when confronted about her involvement in Russia-backed events organized by the Being Patriotic Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s the least important thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo a foreign adversary meddles in the U.S. elections and uses you in the process, yet you are patriotic? OK, Becky. OK.\n\nWhen the reporter told her the group was Russian-backed, she denied it\u2014after saying she didn\u2019t care if Russia was involved or not. \u201cI don\u2019t go with the Russians,\u201d she said. Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters. That\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events. They simply found real Trump supporters and backed their cause. CNN reported that Goldfarb and other Trump backers in Florida were duped into believing they were communicating electronically and over the phone with other Trump supporters. Often, they were speaking to Russians willing to offer financial and logistical support.\n\nOne of the people tricked into believing the Being Patriotic Facebook page\u2014which was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St. Petersburg, Russia (who also had 13 of its members indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller)\u2014was Harry Miller. He was paid \u201c$1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person with whom Miller spoke on the phone didn\u2019t speak fluent English. Figuring the person was a first-generation immigrant, Miller\u2019s suspicions weren\u2019t set off.\n\n\u201cThey had that beautiful website, were very supportive of the candidate and there was nothing, nothing at all that lends you to think it was anything other that people trying to support a candidate,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nWell, at least Miller seems to believe he was tricked.\n\nGoldfarb? Not so much. When the CNN reporter probed her about her communications with Russians connected to Being Patriotic, she denied it and said, \u201cHillary Clinton was and so was her bandits, Mueller.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBandit is not a term you hear in the American vernacular every day, but it is commonly used to describe criminals in Russia. Even in Ukraine, where I visit often, the word \u201cbandit\u201d is commonly used to describe criminals. I highly suspect that while Goldfarb may not have met with Russians in person, she may have picked up the word from conversing with Russians electronically or over the phone. Again, I don\u2019t know, but I suspect this may be the case.\n\nAnyway, check out her two minutes of denial below.

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["school", "students", "right", "shooting", "douglas", "parkland", "seeking", "gun", "fla", "used", "stoneman", "state", "aide", "reform", "theories", "far", "survivors"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

With some of the ads calling for protections of gun rights, warning of the so-called dangers of immigration and of promoting Black Lives Matter groups, the Kremlin has shown a shrewd willingness to manipulate race relations in the United States at any cost to the Americans it once claimed to support: black people.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post recently reported that members of Congress have already discovered that some of the ads have depicted a rise of Black Lives Matter groups in ways aiming to evoke fears among white Americans of an opposing political threat rising. CNN published its own reporting detailing how some of the ads promoted gun rights and the Second Amendment, both topics that resonate with many white Americans who feel their rights are being infringed upon. Conceivably, this tactic, in turn, was supposed to encourage white Americans, with their racist insecurities, to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile more studies are revealing that false information spread on social media in swing states more often than in nonswing ones, the jury is still out on whether or not \u201cfake news\u201d actually impacted people\u2019s voting at the ballot box.\n\nBut one thing is 100 percent clear: The Russian Federation\u2014a nation that, through its former state of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, long claimed to be an advocate for black liberation\u2014never loved us. This week\u2019s revelations of Facebook ads specifically using Black Lives Matter activists as bait for white aggrievement is a sharp reversal of Russia\u2019s racial manipulation tactics in the United States.\n\nAs early as the 1920s, Soviet leadership realized that they could take on Western imperialism by exploiting its mistreatment of black people\u2014be it under Jim Crow in the United States or colonialism on the continent of Africa. The selling point was that the USSR was better, which it never really was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe USSR financed tens of thousands of black people to study in various republics throughout the union with the hope that they would return to their homelands to start their own Red Octobers. On the U.S. front, the USSR also recruited black Americans to spread its propaganda.\n\nOne of their prized recruits was the great writer Langston Hughes. He and several dozen other black people were selected to act in a USSR-funded filmed titled Black and White, a cinematic chiding of American Southern racism. Hughes details in his autobiography, I Wonder as I Wander, that the black performers were not trained actors; nor could most of them sing for the parts the roles required. (Hughes determined that Russians assumed all black people could sing, dance, play sports and act, so there was no need to vet them for any real qualifications.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt any rate, the film ended up getting scrapped because the U.S. granted the USSR diplomatic recognition in 1933. One of the conditions, among paying unsettled debts to Washington, D.C., was to end all propaganda against America\u2014which, of course, included Black and White. Rightfully, the young black wannabe actors felt betrayed and considered the Soviets\u2019 attempts to curry favor with the black struggle insincere and downright fraudulent.\n\nThey were correct.\n\nIn Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union, Robert Robinson wrote about how he was recruited by the USSR to be an engineer in a Moscow plant in 1930. Robinson was looking for engineering work, which he could never find in Detroit, where he worked a dead-end job in a Ford Motor Co. plant. Soviet representatives, who were very likely spies, convinced him that he\u2019d be able to earn an engineering degree in Moscow\u2014which he did\u2014and not face any racism\u2014which, of course, he faced a lot of, including from his own bosses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoviet authorities plastered his face on state-run newspapers with reports of his job promotions throughout the \u201930s, \u201940s and \u201950s. All the while, he was regularly called nigger by his colleagues and passed over for managerial roles at his factory by less-qualified Russians who often took credit for his work. Worst of all, Soviet authorities refused to let him leave the country for fear that he\u2019d reveal how much of a sham the USSR\u2019s claim of solidarity with black people really was. He ended up escaping to Uganda in 1974.\n\nAllison Blakely, professor emeritus of history at Boston University and one of America\u2019s leading authorities on Russia\u2019s relationship with black people, said that the kinds of experiences black people like Robinson lived through were common. While the USSR was proficient in attracting black Americans, it made little real effort to have meaningful relations with them.\n\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t so much of the success of what the communists were offering,\u201d Blakely said. \u201cIt was the disappointment of what the United States was doing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, while the USSR proved to be just as discriminatory as America in many respects, it was creating propaganda for its citizens designed to show that black people were treated better in Russia than in the United States. One of the classic examples of this is an old 1960s Soviet cartoon called Mister Twister, which depicted an American imperialist being chided for bringing his racist attitudes with him to the Soviet Union:\n\nAnother propaganda film, from 1936, was Circus, in which a white American circus performer, played by Soviet actress Lyubov Petrovna Orlova, gives birth to a black baby and faces racism in the states. But when she arrives in the USSR, everyone loves her and her black baby. Just like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all bullshit, since both Russian and white American men weren\u2019t cool with their women messing with black men. But the film was well-produced at the time and is worth watching to see how hard the USSR worked to convince black people (and their own Soviet citizens) that the Soviet Union had their backs.\n\nAll the while, the KGB was working to undermine America\u2019s sovereignty at the expense of the same black people they claimed to support. Perhaps the most egregious example was the KGB\u2019s attempt to plant fake stories in black newspapers about Martin Luther King Jr. being an \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d according to former KGB Officer Vasily Mitrokhin. The KGB also tried to exploit King\u2019s death by spreading fake news among black nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan and the Jewish Defense League about his murder in order to start a race war, according to Darien Cavanaugh over at War Is Boring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put: Evoking racial fears among Americans is an old game for Russia.\n\nWhat is new with today\u2019s Kremlin is that a new opportunity to exploit race in a different way has presented itself. Instead of siding with the oppressed black American population, Russian security services have clearly realized that it is to the Kremlin\u2019s advantage to side with racist white people. Russia\u2019s own rising nationalism, which views immigration from Central Asia as a threat, and Russian politicians\u2019 support of it make for a very convenient relationship with American racists.\n\n\u201cThe Russian leadership sees themselves as the redeemers of whiteness,\u201d said Maxim Matusevich, director of the Russian and East European Studies program at Seton Hall University. \u201cIt is a reversal of the past when the Soviets were standing up for the oppressed and the minorities. Now all of a sudden they\u2019re standing up for whiteness. That\u2019s why I think Putin is so popular with segments of the American right, because they see Russians as the guardians of whiteness: They\u2019re white and they are Christian, they are anti-gay and anti-minority.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than 70 years, the USSR engaged in a robust propaganda campaign to prove it was the oasis of black liberation. It was all a lie. In its current model of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin has proved that, like its USSR predecessor state, it will use black people as a political tool whenever it suits them.\n\nWe were a tool of the USSR foreign policy then, and we are a tool of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia now. The Soviets didn\u2019t love us then, and Putin\u2019s Russia certainly proves it doesn\u2019t love us now.", "keywords": ["russian", "kremlin", "ussr", "states", "prove", "loved", "recent", "white", "black", "american", "soviet", "ads", "facebook", "americans", "russias", "united"], "polarity": 0.030344199719199747, "subjectivity": 0.3364225526725525},

I don\u2019t know. Maybe I was being naive.\u201d\n\nCrooks claims that Trump grabbed her hand and started kissing her.\n\n\u201cHe started kissing me on one cheek, then the other cheek. He was talking to me in between kisses, asking where I was from or if I wanted to be a model. He wouldn\u2019t let go of my hand, and then he went right in and started kissing me on the lips,\u201d she said during a recent dinner party, the Post reports.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a long kiss,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole thing probably lasted two minutes, maybe less.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, President Tweety von TypeTooMuch took to social media to bash Crooks\u2019 account of that day.\n\nHe said that despite the fact that Crooks\u2019 account of the event sounds a lot like Trump\u2019s own words captured on a hot mic during an appearance on Access Hollywood in 2005:\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m automatically attracted to beautiful women. I just start kissing them. It\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrooks is one of 19 women who the Post notes have accused the president of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cThey claimed Trump had \u2018acted like a creepy uncle,\u2019 or \u2018squeezed my butt,\u2019 or \u2018eyed me like meat,\u2019 or \u2018stuck his hand up under my skirt,\u2019 or \u2018groped with octopus hands,\u2019 or \u2018pushed me against a wall,\u2019 or \u2018thrust his genitals,\u2019 or \u2018forced his tongue into my mouth\u2019 or \u2018offered $10,000 for everything,\u2019\u201d the Post reports.\n\nCrooks has noted that she wants no money from Trump and added that she has no plans of suing the president, but she wants her story out in the public. Trump, of course, has denied everything, calling all of the women liars and noting that their stories are part of an intricate leftist plot to bring down his presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have one question for President ManTits von NineteenAccusers: What about Stormy Daniels? She has dragged Trump\u2019s name through the piss-stained Russian streets, and his own lawyer has even admitted to paying her off, yet Trump comes after Crooks.\n\nSay Daniels\u2019 name, though. I bet he won\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want that heat, but don\u2019t worry: The Russia collusion, sexual assaults and teenage anger over the GOP\u2019s overall lack of concern for human life are closing in around him.

The family also says that an eyewitness account from Gaines' next-door neighbor paints a different picture of the day from what police statements have indicated.\n\nPolice have said that Gaines was shot after pointing a shotgun at officers and threatening to kill them after they tried to serve arrest warrants on her and her boyfriend, the site notes.

Now, I happen to like it. It was well-acted and moving and is probably the second-best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie; people like different kinds of movies. just as they like different kinds of ice cream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose-intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery, complain that they didn\u2019t have a nondairy version of butter-cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand-word think piece on how the ice cream-industrial complex is misleading black folks.\n\nYet, like clockwork, late-night college-dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying that Erik Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t those.\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first: Killmonger wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI know that people are having #ExpressYourUnpopularOpinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it; folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot takes on one of the most successful superhero films of all time to get clicks on their SoundCloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean that any of the critiques are right\u2014and most aren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as king of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world.\n\nSome people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt that the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading?\n\nKillmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas. They didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were\u2014again\u2014ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns; it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas.\n\nWeapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Ku Klux Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people, no matter how many vibranium-shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson, Mo.\n\nNow, if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on vibranium, I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a PowerPoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is, though, Killmonger didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More important, Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because film director Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution; it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily. What do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide-scale revolution can occur to you only if you didn\u2019t watch the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandans are part of a never colonized, ethnocentric, isolationist, theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years, and that was like a 15-minute Hoverbike trip from Panther Palace.\n\nHow would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to Pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip?\n\nKillmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge. W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism, and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics felt the need to center him in the movie, and it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop-culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross is in Wakanda is that he took a bullet for the girl the king is sweating. Notice that the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that, they called Ross \u201ccolonizer,\u201d locked him in a room, and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger, Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time on or gave too much focus to Ross, you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the Transportation Security Administration, aka the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u201clook\u201d revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies, even though Magneto is right every. single. time., he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained, despite being a former slave himself, Django cares nothing about freeing others; all he wants is to get his wife back.\n\nIn other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is OK if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther. The movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution; it\u2019s about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to one another, wrapped up in a coup and a bunch of computer-generated images and fancy costumes.\n\nKillmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and ahistorical. Let\u2019s save the concern-trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie; those movies are much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["revolutionary", "yall", "panther", "movie", "movies", "revolution", "black", "killmonger", "wrong", "think", "ross", "didnt", "know"], "polarity": 0.025088763575605678, "subjectivity": 0.44868072960178224},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark.

But CNN reports that she did, in fact, promote pro-Trump events that were encouraged by Russian trolls on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if they were involved or not,\u201d she told a CNN reporter when confronted about her involvement in Russia-backed events organized by the Being Patriotic Facebook page. \u201cThat\u2019s the least important thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo a foreign adversary meddles in the U.S. elections and uses you in the process, yet you are patriotic? OK, Becky. OK.\n\nWhen the reporter told her the group was Russian-backed, she denied it\u2014after saying she didn\u2019t care if Russia was involved or not. \u201cI don\u2019t go with the Russians,\u201d she said. Goldfarb said all the people at her meetings were Trump supporters. That\u2019s the thing, though. Russia didn\u2019t create fake events. They simply found real Trump supporters and backed their cause. CNN reported that Goldfarb and other Trump backers in Florida were duped into believing they were communicating electronically and over the phone with other Trump supporters. Often, they were speaking to Russians willing to offer financial and logistical support.\n\nOne of the people tricked into believing the Being Patriotic Facebook page\u2014which was run by the Internet Research Agency, a troll group in St. Petersburg, Russia (who also had 13 of its members indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller)\u2014was Harry Miller. He was paid \u201c$1,000 by the Russians to build a cage that was used to depict a person dressed as Hillary Clinton in a prison cell at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida in August 2016,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person with whom Miller spoke on the phone didn\u2019t speak fluent English. Figuring the person was a first-generation immigrant, Miller\u2019s suspicions weren\u2019t set off.\n\n\u201cThey had that beautiful website, were very supportive of the candidate and there was nothing, nothing at all that lends you to think it was anything other that people trying to support a candidate,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nWell, at least Miller seems to believe he was tricked.\n\nGoldfarb? Not so much. When the CNN reporter probed her about her communications with Russians connected to Being Patriotic, she denied it and said, \u201cHillary Clinton was and so was her bandits, Mueller.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBandit is not a term you hear in the American vernacular every day, but it is commonly used to describe criminals in Russia. Even in Ukraine, where I visit often, the word \u201cbandit\u201d is commonly used to describe criminals. I highly suspect that while Goldfarb may not have met with Russians in person, she may have picked up the word from conversing with Russians electronically or over the phone. Again, I don\u2019t know, but I suspect this may be the case.\n\nAnyway, check out her two minutes of denial below.

I feared that two common trends would find their way to the forefront after hearing the Baltimore County Police Department\u2019s version of events.\n\nI was first nervous that black men would be silent about Gaines\u2019 being killed\u2014or alternatively, would speak, but use that as an opportunity to blame her for her own death. Simultaneously, I worried that police would reveal minimal information as a way to figure out their story first before airing it public. Both occurred.\n\nAlthough both are frequent occurrences in the realm of many male-centered #BlackLivesMatter social media narratives, I have not come to expect much of the police other than recycled lies and good-ol\u2019-boy traditions. This is, part and parcel, why I have no issue with being Team #AbolishThePolice. However, it is the former that hurts more than the latter. The fact that when I log on to the internet and find my way through the Twittersphere, I see black men blaming black women like Gaines\u2014the same black women who defend us even to their detriment\u2014hurts like hell.\n\nAlthough men often remain silent about the violence black women face, black women continually fight for and defend black men. How often do we organize national marches for black women killed by police? Let\u2019s face it: Black women rarely receive respect in movement-building spaces, including online mechanisms, despite always being front and center in ongoing fights against police brutality. It\u2019s quite terrifying to have anyone think that women like Gaines are the causes of their own deaths. And having that cruel argument come from black men adds insult to injury.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t escape me that the world needs more people like Gaines: women who are bold, women who don\u2019t want to die with their hands up because they understand that they can be shot anyhow, and women who are about transformative justice. Gaines recognized that none of this could be done with concession. This, coupled with the understanding that black America doesn\u2019t need to sanitize Gaines\u2019 life for us to #SayHerName, is critical. Gaines fought (and fought hard), and she wanted to ensure that her son understood not to fear police. But still, none of this means she deserved to die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, what we know is that if Gaines had been white, she would have lived. The main argument circulating is that \u201cshe asked to die when she pointed the gun at police.\u201d Assuming she actually pointed a gun, we must understand that her blackness is what got her killed, not a rifle.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been numerous occasions when white people have pointed guns at police officers and have remained alive\u2014and, in some instances, have kept their firearms. E.J. Watson, for example, was arrested in October of 2015 for waving a loaded gun on the road, and when the police came, he did not put it down. He\u2019s still living. And this year, the police approached a vehicle of Jed Frazier, a white man, as he pulled a handgun from his coat pocket and pointed it at police. He\u2019s not dead.\n\nWhile we may not know too much about Gaines, we do know police. We do know that we need to continue to #SayHerName if black women are to mean anything to us and our movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we know that the body count of black women like Gaines who are executed by police and blamed for their own blood will continue to rise as long as we are silent about their pain, cowardly co-signing the lie that they deserved it.", "keywords": ["women", "killed", "men", "pointed", "white", "sayhername", "doesnt", "gaines", "black", "way", "korryn", "silent", "perfect", "know", "need"], "polarity": -0.02685969868173258, "subjectivity": 0.38024952919020716},

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["riots", "panther", "wanted", "njobu", "history", "black", "killmonger", "revisionist", "help", "cant", "tchalla", "know", "folks"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

The cuddle buddies we had for the winter can be turned loose, and we can get back to being fabulously single and ready to mingle.\n\n\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t need some amount of satisfaction and release, and for those moments when no one is around, a vibrator can come through in a pinch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt can\u2019t be just any vibrator, however. There are different types of vibrators that serve different types of needs, and being familiar with them all will help you make your choice (or choices) on your next visit to the toy store.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s not your mother\u2019s vibrator anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clitoris contains 8,000 nerve endings. For many women, it is the center of vaginal pleasure. It stands to reason that there would be a great many vibrators made specifically for clitoral stimulation.\n\nIn our mothers\u2019 day, all the vibrators looked the same\u2014boring. They were functional and operated on D batteries \u2014 which could make them very inconvenient if and when the batteries ran out.\n\nVibrators for clitoral stimulation have grown up and gotten more advanced these days.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy personal favorite is the Magic Wand. It used to be known as the Hitachi Magic Wand, but Hitachi didn\u2019t like all the attention it was getting from the popular sex toy, so it rebranded it as \u201cthe Magic Wand.\u201d\n\nThe Magic Wand doesn\u2019t work on batteries; it plugs into an electrical outlet, which means you can get hours of pleasure from this bad boy. There are two speeds, but I can tell you from personal experience that you want to keep it on low. High speed will likely numb your nerves out, and that won\u2019t be fun for anyone.\n\n\n\nIt gives a very good (and sometimes very quick) orgasm, and it is well worth the cost to invest in one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor women who want more than a clitoral orgasm.\n\nThere are times, of course, when a girl wants more than a clitoral orgasm, and for those times, there are vibrators like the Fifty Shades of Grey Greedy Girl G-Spot Rabbit Vibrator, which provides both clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne part of the vibrator can be inserted in your vagina, and while that end is doing its job on the inside, the \u201crabbit\u201d ears stimulate the clitoris.\n\nNow, I know we have been told that squirting orgasms are just pee (I still don\u2019t believe this shit; damn the experts), but please believe me\u2014this vibrator is a squirting-orgasm inducer. I love it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vibrator is rechargeable\u2014which again means that you don\u2019t need batteries, and you can get hours of pleasure from it. The internal vibrator and the rabbit ears operate on two separate motors, which means you can control the speed of your orgasms so that one doesn\u2019t happen before the other, if you know what I mean.\n\n\n\nIf you do want to play with a partner.\n\nI was just kidding earlier when I said we would be kicking our cuddle buddies to the side. Not all of us are going to do that, and if you want to engage in a little bit of couples play, there are vibrators for that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are vibrating cock rings, and there are strap-ons that include a small bullet vibrator for the person wearing the strap-on, so both partners can get pleasured at once.\n\nDon\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it; that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nWhichever type of toy you choose, whether you are going on a solo orgasmic journey or one with a partner, be sure to shop around and find the right one for the type of pleasure you are looking for. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a little extra money on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike bad sex, a bad vibrator is a frustrating and disappointing experience.

Resolution 40, a bill that overturned a rule designed to prevent certain people with mental health problems from buying a gun. The optics are especially bad given that 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz used his legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle to gun down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\u201cA White House photographer confirmed to CBS News that there are photos of the bill signing. Those photos won\u2019t be seen unless the Trump administration releases them, though, because the White House is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act,\u201d CBS News reports.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama introduced the rule after the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn., and it went into effect in December 2016. CBS News notes that had the measure stayed in effect, about 75,000 names of Americans with mental health issues and receiving Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income would have been sent to a database, thus stopping them from buying a gun.\n\nShortly after Trump signed his measure, the National Rifle Association put out a press release quoting NRA Executive Director Chris Cox: \u201cToday marks a new era for law-abiding gun owners, as we have now have a president who respects and supports our right to keep and bear arms,\u201d CBS News reports.\n\nGood to see that Trump is respecting his right-to-bear-arms-loving base and that the White House is up to its usual tricks of trying to scrub the memory of a bill removing mental health restrictions on gun ownership, given that Trump gave a six-minute speech after the Florida shooting, not about guns or gun laws, but about\u2014you guessed it\u2014mental health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been revised to clarify that the Obama rule would not have prevented the tragedy in Florida, since, as far as we know, Nikolas Cruz was not on SSI or SSDI.", "keywords": ["restrictions", "bill", "rule", "president", "health", "signing", "overturned", "release", "refuses", "white", "house", "gun", "cbs", "trump", "mental", "report"], "polarity": 0.021817416590143857, "subjectivity": 0.36739122830031923},

In another, Gaines appears to be talking to the young boy, identified by some media organizations as her son, asking him what he would like to do.\n\n\"Who's outside?\" Gaines asks the child.\n\n\"The police,\" the child responds.\n\n\"And what are they trying to do?\" Gaines continues.\n\n\"They trying to kill us,\" the boy answers.\n\nEarlier:\n\nBaltimore County police officers fatally shot a woman Monday following what they say was an hourslong standoff during which the 23-year-old threatened to kill the officers while pointing a gun at them, the Baltimore Sun reports.\n\nAuthorities identified the woman as Korryn Gaines. A 5-year-old boy who was with Gaines at the time of the shooting also suffered a gunshot wound, police said, but he is expected to survive. According to the Sun, it is still not clear whether police or Gaines shot the child, and police have not yet confirmed the relationship between Gaines and the child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun reports that police also said that it is not yet known whether any of the officers involved in the shooting were wearing body cameras. According to the report, the Baltimore County Police Department had only just begun introducing body cameras in the last month, and only some officers have received the devices.\n\nAccording to the report, the incident began around 9:20 a.m. Monday when several warrant-squad members and a uniformed police officer went to the home in Randallstown to serve arrest warrants on Gaines and a man who also lived at the home.\n\nPolice say the man ran from the home with a 1-year-old child in tow but was eventually caught by officers. His name has not yet been released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice \"repeatedly knocked on the apartment door,\" and say they heard a man's voice and a woman's voice as well as that of a crying child, but say no one answered the summons after police identified themselves.\n\nAccording to the Sun, Gaines was wanted for not appearing for cases related to a March incident in which she was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and several traffic violations.\n\nOn Monday, authorities say, police showing up to the apartment where Gaines was got a key from the landlord, opened the apartment door and saw Gaines seated on the floor. Police say that she had the 5-year-old boy in her arms and was holding a long gun, which, police say, she pointed at one of the officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus began an hourslong negotiation, police say.\n\n\"During that dialogue and conversation, she repeatedly pointed a long gun at the police officers,\" Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson told the Sun.\n\nSeveral hours later, at around 3 p.m., Gaines pointed the long gun at police officers again and told them that if they didn't leave, \"she was going to kill them,\" Johnson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's when an officer fired once at Gaines, and she fired back several times, the police chief said. Officers fired again, killing the 23-year-old woman.\n\nGaines' uncle, Jerome Barnett, said his niece was \"feisty, but she was smart and she was respectful.\"\n\n\"My niece is a good person; I never knew her to be a rowdy person,\" Barnett added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJerome Barnett's twin, Jermaine, added that Gaines was \"a beautiful person, really smart, intellectual.\"\n\n\"I'm in a surreal state of mind right now,\" Jermaine Barnett said. \"She was loved by everybody\u2014I'm going to miss her and I love her.\"\n\nAccording to the Sun, the police officers involved in the shooting have not been identified, per an agreement with the county police union.

(Credit: ABC News)\n\nHow Supremacist Trolls Spread Rumors to Media\n\n\u201cFollowing misrepresentations by a white nationalist leader and coordinated efforts by internet trolls, numerous researchers and media outlets spread a seemingly false claim that the man charged with killing more than a dozen people at a Florida high school belonged to an extremist group,\u201d Shawn Musgrave reported Friday for Politico.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies say they have no evidence so far to support this claim, and the rumor appears to have been perpetrated by white nationalist trolls themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201c \u2018A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [....] was associated with his group,\u2019 the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

Black Panther, who finds himself in a battle against an army led by the man who killed his father. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels quoted Holland, \u201c \u2018One of the things that I have learned throughout this process is that the world has such rich stories that haven\u2019t been told yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018One of the things that writing these books does for me is it reminds me when I go to work every day that what we do as journalists is that we tell stories. We bring the hidden to light.\n\n\u201cJust like the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 movie and this novel does, they\u2019re bringing the character to light that some people knew about, and some people appreciated, but now through this novel and the movie, the entire world gets to know about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018. . . So, it just reminds me of how important our jobs are and how lucky we are as journalists to be able to do it.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom DiChristopher reported Friday for cnbc.com, \u201cBoxoffice.com is currently forecasting the movie will haul in $190 million to $215 million over the long weekend. The website projects it will earn $178 million over three days.\n\n\u201cThat would be enough to put it in the upper range of the top 10 highest grossing openings for a superhero movie. At that level, Black Panther would top heavyweights such as Batman, Superman and Spider-Man and take aim at the best-ever debut for a superhero movie focused on a solo character.\n\n\u201cStrong reviews, outstanding pre-sales and a holiday weekend release underpin the bullish forecast, but it might be the revolutionary nature of the film that pushes it beyond consensus estimates, said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at boxoffice.com. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGene Demby, NPR \u201cCode Switch\u201d: Can Marvel\u2019s New Superhero Bear The Weight Of Representation?\n\nJohn Eligon; Kwame Opam; Carvell Wallace; Crystal Martin; Walter Thompson-Hernandez; Mekado Murphy; Manohla Dargis and A.O.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

The cuddle buddies we had for the winter can be turned loose, and we can get back to being fabulously single and ready to mingle.\n\n\n\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t need some amount of satisfaction and release, and for those moments when no one is around, a vibrator can come through in a pinch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt can\u2019t be just any vibrator, however. There are different types of vibrators that serve different types of needs, and being familiar with them all will help you make your choice (or choices) on your next visit to the toy store.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s not your mother\u2019s vibrator anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe clitoris contains 8,000 nerve endings. For many women, it is the center of vaginal pleasure. It stands to reason that there would be a great many vibrators made specifically for clitoral stimulation.\n\nIn our mothers\u2019 day, all the vibrators looked the same\u2014boring. They were functional and operated on D batteries \u2014 which could make them very inconvenient if and when the batteries ran out.\n\nVibrators for clitoral stimulation have grown up and gotten more advanced these days.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy personal favorite is the Magic Wand. It used to be known as the Hitachi Magic Wand, but Hitachi didn\u2019t like all the attention it was getting from the popular sex toy, so it rebranded it as \u201cthe Magic Wand.\u201d\n\nThe Magic Wand doesn\u2019t work on batteries; it plugs into an electrical outlet, which means you can get hours of pleasure from this bad boy. There are two speeds, but I can tell you from personal experience that you want to keep it on low. High speed will likely numb your nerves out, and that won\u2019t be fun for anyone.\n\n\n\nIt gives a very good (and sometimes very quick) orgasm, and it is well worth the cost to invest in one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor women who want more than a clitoral orgasm.\n\nThere are times, of course, when a girl wants more than a clitoral orgasm, and for those times, there are vibrators like the Fifty Shades of Grey Greedy Girl G-Spot Rabbit Vibrator, which provides both clitoral and vaginal stimulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne part of the vibrator can be inserted in your vagina, and while that end is doing its job on the inside, the \u201crabbit\u201d ears stimulate the clitoris.\n\nNow, I know we have been told that squirting orgasms are just pee (I still don\u2019t believe this shit; damn the experts), but please believe me\u2014this vibrator is a squirting-orgasm inducer. I love it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vibrator is rechargeable\u2014which again means that you don\u2019t need batteries, and you can get hours of pleasure from it. The internal vibrator and the rabbit ears operate on two separate motors, which means you can control the speed of your orgasms so that one doesn\u2019t happen before the other, if you know what I mean.\n\n\n\nIf you do want to play with a partner.\n\nI was just kidding earlier when I said we would be kicking our cuddle buddies to the side. Not all of us are going to do that, and if you want to engage in a little bit of couples play, there are vibrators for that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are vibrating cock rings, and there are strap-ons that include a small bullet vibrator for the person wearing the strap-on, so both partners can get pleasured at once.\n\nDon\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve tried it; that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\nWhichever type of toy you choose, whether you are going on a solo orgasmic journey or one with a partner, be sure to shop around and find the right one for the type of pleasure you are looking for. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a little extra money on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike bad sex, a bad vibrator is a frustrating and disappointing experience.

Overall, I thought it was cool with some very interesting stories and facts, but I believe it suffered from a time crunch. Ultimately, and most importantly, I\u2019m glad it exists. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. I love HBCUs with my whole heart. When I\u2019m near HBCUs, I go to their bookstores to buy T-shirts and sweatshirts. I have a collection of HBCU tees. And I know many more people like myself, especially graduates, whose love for our black colleges runs Mississippi River deep. We plan on sending our kids there and we go to homecomings and we love the blackness. HBCUs were Wakanda before Wakanda was a thing.\n\nFor that reason, there\u2019s almost zero chance I wouldn\u2019t watch a documentary about the history of HBCUs. We need as much information as possiblein the public sphere about the importance of HBCUs\u2014something that the documentary touches on heavily\u2014and their role in various moments in history, especially the civil rights movement. For those reasons, if you haven\u2019t checked it out, I recommend it.\n\n2. With that being said, the biggest limitation of the documentary is that there are over 100 HBCUs with lots of stories and they had 82 minutes to cover the conception of the schools through present day. Lots of things got left out. Several prominent HBCUs got very little mention if any, and the achievements of most were left off the table. I feel like this could have been an episode of Eyes on the Prize\u2014the 14-part series on the civil rights movement\u2014about the role of black schools in black history and rise of the black middle class.\n\n3. While I wanted more about the history of the schools, the documentary focused more on the roles the they played in the history of America. From that vantage point, the documentary was successful in discussing the environment in which HBCUs were born and thrived and some of the challenges facing them currently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. The documentary spent a lot of time on why Booker T. Washington was effectively a sellout. I realize that his grooming at Hampton and then ascendance at Tuskegee University created his mindset of starting at the bottom and working our way up in society (which I don\u2019t agree with), but the commentators made no bones about calling that man damaging to the black community. I was surprised to see the documentary go that route.\n\nFor perspective, as stated in the documentary, Hampton Institute and eventually Tuskegee were founded as trade schools for blacks to maintain the white perception of black inferiority. Washington\u2019s story in the black community is a complex one. His successes are documented with praise, but his stance of making white America comfortable in knowing that black students were going to learn to be their helpers and low-level workers was met with some pretty stark resistance in many quarters of the black community and welcomed by the white community.\n\n5. W.E.B. Du Bois was lauded as a polar opposite to Washington, who sought to create a community of educated black folks who would be in positions of authority and help create a viable black community. Most of us who went to HBCUs spent semesters discussing their philosophical differences and impact, often without much appreciation for Washington\u2019s line of thinking. I wonder how they talk about Booker T. at Tuskegee. I mean, Tuskegee University is a highly respected institution today, especially for engineering. History is interesting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I really enjoyed the archival footage of the schools. A lot a lot.\n\n7. I had never heard about the students being shot at Southern A&M University in Baton Rouge, La., in 1972. I had no idea about that student uprising. Or about Fisk University\u2019s student uprising to get their ultra-conservative white president, Fayette McKenzie, outta there in 1925. It was interesting to see student protests and strikes toward school administrations and not just against white supremacy, because HBCUs are not without their issues.\n\n8. I thought the doc ending on the story of Morris Brown College (it\u2019s one of the final three vignettes) was interesting considering how Morris Brown College\u2014for all of its important history as the only school in the Atlanta University Center (Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University and Interdenominational Theological Center) that was founded by black folks\u2014is largely shuttered. At its height, when I was in school, roughly 2,500 students attended Morris Brown, and now there are about 50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also focused on Florida A&M University and a student in the band, which was another interesting choice considering the fire the school was under because of the hazing death of Robert Champion in 2011, which resulted in criminal charges and the suspension of the band for a few years. The band, the Marching 100, has since been reinstated; it\u2019s just interesting that the final two stories the doc focused on were Morris Brown and FAMU\u2019s band, two fairly dark spots in recent HBCU history.\n\n9. There\u2019s talk about HBCUs struggling a bit and the reasons for it. This is a long-standing discussion in the black community. There are over 100 HBCUs; it\u2019s nearly impossible for all of them to thrive. The top-tier schools (you can argue among yourselves about what schools fall into that ranking) even have significant struggles.\n\nAt the same time, applications for many HBCUs have seen record highs in the midst of the extremely racialized climate of the nation. Schools like Spelman are receiving record numbers of applicants, which speaks to the fact that there\u2019s still a need. Documentaries like this are helpful reminders of this country\u2019s history and why our schools matter to our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. SpelHouse fo\u2019 lyfe. I just wanted to share that. I loved how much they featured Howard University and the reshaping of its law school (and of course, the ascent of Thurgood Marshall). That happened because of Mordecai Johnson, Howard\u2019s first black president. He was a Morehouse Man.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

This is all alleged, since we don\u2019t know if any of this is true, so we are trudging very lightly over this muddy mess. In fact, this shouldn\u2019t be on our radar because it\u2019s steeped in scandal and messiness, but I have thoughts and questions\u2014tons of them.\n\n1. Why Would a Married Man Make a Sex Tape With Someone Other Than His Wife?\n\nI blame this guy. Whoever this guy is, this is all his fault. There is no way in the world that there should ever be footage of anything happening that you wouldn\u2019t want shown during your divorce proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Also, Why Would Anyone Want to Tape Themselves Having Sex?\n\nAs my colleague Senior Writer Michael Harriot noted, \u201cRecording yourself having sex is ALWAYS a bad idea. It\u2019s only worked for Kim Kardashian.\u201d #WhitePrivilege\n\n3. Wait a Minute, Ain\u2019t That Brandy\u2019s Mother?\n\nAgain, who knows if any of this is true, but Sonja Norwood allegedly posted a message on Facebook noting that something needed to be done about said sex scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Do the Norwoods Get a Percentage of All Sex Tapes Made Around the World?\n\nNo, now you are just being silly. Is it awkward that Lil\u2019 Ray Norwood, aka Ray J, was part of one of the biggest sex tapes in the world, and now his mother is reportedly speaking out on this one? Yes, but that\u2019s because Mama Norwood is an alumna of the school. That\u2019s right, the Mississippi native earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at the HBCU and is an active alum, but she doesn\u2019t hold a monopoly on sex tapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Who Uploaded the Video?\n\nSomeone had to shoot the footage, and then someone had to upload the tape onto the interwebs. I know the company line is to claim that the footage was stolen and leaked or whatever, but in this case I\u2019m not buying it. Look\u2014whenever you have a man cheating on his wife, follow the side piece. Don\u2019t look at me like that; you know it\u2019s true.\n\nNow it sounds as if this leaked footage might actually be a cybercrime.\n\n\u201cBecause of implications that a cyber-crime may have occurred, we take matters like this very seriously,\u201d the university wrote in a statement viewed by WBRZ, which continues:\n\n[W]e advise and caution our students and employees on the importance of data security as well as the ramifications of their conduct on social media.

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States? Nope.

Overall, I thought it was cool with some very interesting stories and facts, but I believe it suffered from a time crunch. Ultimately, and most importantly, I\u2019m glad it exists. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. I love HBCUs with my whole heart. When I\u2019m near HBCUs, I go to their bookstores to buy T-shirts and sweatshirts. I have a collection of HBCU tees. And I know many more people like myself, especially graduates, whose love for our black colleges runs Mississippi River deep. We plan on sending our kids there and we go to homecomings and we love the blackness.

For those reasons, if you haven\u2019t checked it out, I recommend it.\n\n2. With that being said, the biggest limitation of the documentary is that there are over 100 HBCUs with lots of stories and they had 82 minutes to cover the conception of the schools through present day. Lots of things got left out. Several prominent HBCUs got very little mention if any, and the achievements of most were left off the table. I feel like this could have been an episode of Eyes on the Prize\u2014the 14-part series on the civil rights movement\u2014about the role of black schools in black history and rise of the black middle class.\n\n3. While I wanted more about the history of the schools, the documentary focused more on the roles the they played in the history of America. From that vantage point, the documentary was successful in discussing the environment in which HBCUs were born and thrived and some of the challenges facing them currently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. The documentary spent a lot of time on why Booker T. Washington was effectively a sellout. I realize that his grooming at Hampton and then ascendance at Tuskegee University created his mindset of starting at the bottom and working our way up in society (which I don\u2019t agree with), but the commentators made no bones about calling that man damaging to the black community.

His successes are documented with praise, but his stance of making white America comfortable in knowing that black students were going to learn to be their helpers and low-level workers was met with some pretty stark resistance in many quarters of the black community and welcomed by the white community.\n\n5. W.E.B. Du Bois was lauded as a polar opposite to Washington, who sought to create a community of educated black folks who would be in positions of authority and help create a viable black community. Most of us who went to HBCUs spent semesters discussing their philosophical differences and impact, often without much appreciation for Washington\u2019s line of thinking. I wonder how they talk about Booker T. at Tuskegee. I mean, Tuskegee University is a highly respected institution today, especially for engineering. History is interesting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I really enjoyed the archival footage of the schools. A lot a lot.\n\n7. I had never heard about the students being shot at Southern A&M University in Baton Rouge, La., in 1972. I had no idea about that student uprising. Or about Fisk University\u2019s student uprising to get their ultra-conservative white president, Fayette McKenzie, outta there in 1925. It was interesting to see student protests and strikes toward school administrations and not just against white supremacy, because HBCUs are not without their issues.\n\n8. I thought the doc ending on the story of Morris Brown College (it\u2019s one of the final three vignettes) was interesting considering how Morris Brown College\u2014for all of its important history as the only school in the Atlanta University Center (Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University and Interdenominational Theological Center) that was founded by black folks\u2014is largely shuttered. At its height, when I was in school, roughly 2,500 students attended Morris Brown, and now there are about 50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also focused on Florida A&M University and a student in the band, which was another interesting choice considering the fire the school was under because of the hazing death of Robert Champion in 2011, which resulted in criminal charges and the suspension of the band for a few years. The band, the Marching 100, has since been reinstated; it\u2019s just interesting that the final two stories the doc focused on were Morris Brown and FAMU\u2019s band, two fairly dark spots in recent HBCU history.\n\n9. There\u2019s talk about HBCUs struggling a bit and the reasons for it. This is a long-standing discussion in the black community. There are over 100 HBCUs; it\u2019s nearly impossible for all of them to thrive. The top-tier schools (you can argue among yourselves about what schools fall into that ranking) even have significant struggles.\n\nAt the same time, applications for many HBCUs have seen record highs in the midst of the extremely racialized climate of the nation. Schools like Spelman are receiving record numbers of applicants, which speaks to the fact that there\u2019s still a need. Documentaries like this are helpful reminders of this country\u2019s history and why our schools matter to our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. SpelHouse fo\u2019 lyfe. I just wanted to share that. I loved how much they featured Howard University and the reshaping of its law school (and of course, the ascent of Thurgood Marshall).

That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E.

It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns.

Most of us who went to HBCUs spent semesters discussing their philosophical differences and impact, often without much appreciation for Washington\u2019s line of thinking. I wonder how they talk about Booker T. at Tuskegee. I mean, Tuskegee University is a highly respected institution today, especially for engineering. History is interesting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. I really enjoyed the archival footage of the schools. A lot a lot.\n\n7. I had never heard about the students being shot at Southern A&M University in Baton Rouge, La., in 1972. I had no idea about that student uprising. Or about Fisk University\u2019s student uprising to get their ultra-conservative white president, Fayette McKenzie, outta there in 1925. It was interesting to see student protests and strikes toward school administrations and not just against white supremacy, because HBCUs are not without their issues.\n\n8. I thought the doc ending on the story of Morris Brown College (it\u2019s one of the final three vignettes) was interesting considering how Morris Brown College\u2014for all of its important history as the only school in the Atlanta University Center (Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University and Interdenominational Theological Center) that was founded by black folks\u2014is largely shuttered. At its height, when I was in school, roughly 2,500 students attended Morris Brown, and now there are about 50.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also focused on Florida A&M University and a student in the band, which was another interesting choice considering the fire the school was under because of the hazing death of Robert Champion in 2011, which resulted in criminal charges and the suspension of the band for a few years. The band, the Marching 100, has since been reinstated; it\u2019s just interesting that the final two stories the doc focused on were Morris Brown and FAMU\u2019s band, two fairly dark spots in recent HBCU history.\n\n9. There\u2019s talk about HBCUs struggling a bit and the reasons for it. This is a long-standing discussion in the black community. There are over 100 HBCUs; it\u2019s nearly impossible for all of them to thrive. The top-tier schools (you can argue among yourselves about what schools fall into that ranking) even have significant struggles.\n\nAt the same time, applications for many HBCUs have seen record highs in the midst of the extremely racialized climate of the nation. Schools like Spelman are receiving record numbers of applicants, which speaks to the fact that there\u2019s still a need. Documentaries like this are helpful reminders of this country\u2019s history and why our schools matter to our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. SpelHouse fo\u2019 lyfe. I just wanted to share that. I loved how much they featured Howard University and the reshaping of its law school (and of course, the ascent of Thurgood Marshall).

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

Referring to him as the premier documentarian of the black experience seemed a little hyperbolic (not to mention that it contained too many syllables). I finally decided that \u201cstoryteller\u201d was an apt description to describe the man whose filmography ranges from 2013\u2019s The Story of Emmett Till to the acclaimed 2015 documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution.\n\nHis latest short film, Black Colleges in the Age of Trump, examines how the current presidential administration has used HBCUs to further its political and social agenda. Created in conjunction with the New York Times Op-Ed Docs, the \u201cop-doc\u201d reflects on the importance of predominantly African-American institutions of higher education in both the past and future of America.\n\nThe 12-minute digital short also serves as a preamble for Nelson\u2019s highly anticipated feature-length project, Tell Them We Are Rising: The Story of Black Colleges and Universities, premiering on the critically acclaimed PBS series Independent Lens on Feb. 19.

But he readily admits that the heightened racial tension and eagerness to accept alternative facts aren\u2019t due solely to the dotard in chief. \u201cTrump is a symptom of what was already there,\u201d said Nelson. He added:\n\nYou also can\u2019t underplay the effect of outlets like Fox News, where people can say: \u201cNo, no, no, the sky is not blue, the sky is red. Trump didn\u2019t call those countries a shithole,\u201d when everybody clearly heard it. Look at it this way: When Richard Nixon was being prosecuted, hounded and chased down for Watergate, there were no news channels that you could turn to that would say, \u201cOh, no, no, no. That didn\u2019t happen. He didn\u2019t break into Watergate. Everything is all right.\u201d That didn\u2019t exist.

Although they might be fewer in number, they will ultimately survive as they have for more than a century and a half.\n\nHe noted, however, that we may witness some drastic changes: \u201cWe have to ask: In 20 years, will there still be 103 black colleges?

As the Washington Post reports, the 32-year-old carpenter grew concerned about the safety of his 3-year-old twins and 1-year old son. The Post notes that the early-morning sighting capped \u201ca string of attempted intrusions\u201d into his home in recent weeks.\n\nSo Rodriguez did what many might do when confronted with a stranger on their property: He called the cops.\n\nThe officers did find the trespasser but didn\u2019t arrest him because they had no probable cause, police say. They did end up arresting Rodriguez. As CNN reports, after asking for his ID, cops discovered that he had an outstanding warrant they believed to be criminal. Not long after calling the police to investigate a possible intruder, Rodriguez, who is an undocumented immigrant, found himself in the back of a squad car.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened next, according to the Post:\n\nRodriguez overheard an officer discussing by speakerphone with a voice on the other end of the line. It was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cortes said. \u201cDo you want us to bring him to you?\u201d the officer asked, Rodriguez later recalled. \u201cThat would be great,\u201d the voice responded. Minutes later, the officers left Rodriguez at a nearby ICE field office. Rodriguez was shackled and later taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, one of the largest detention facilities in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, the warrant wasn\u2019t criminal at all. According to the Tukwila Police Department\u2019s own admissions, it misinterpreted the nature of the warrant against Rodriguez. It was actually an administrative warrant, related to a missed court hearing from 2004, when authorities in Texas discovered that he had entered the country illegally.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer, Luis Cortes Romero, told the Post that his client never received the notice to attend the mandatory court meeting, but missing it triggered a removal order.\n\nThis makes Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, essentially, a mistake. The Tukwila PD confirmed that it \u201cdoes not respond to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals on their behalf.\u201d The only reason Rodriguez was arrested was that his administrative warrant appeared like a criminal one in the National Criminal Information Center database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement now refuses to release Rodriguez, according to his lawyer. He maintains that his client has no criminal record. Rodriguez could be deported within a matter of days, leaving his young children without a father.\n\n\n\nThe arrest falls in line with one of the more troubling trends of the Donald Trump administration. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed in the last year. The Washington Post found that ICE had detained 37,734 undocumented \u201cnoncriminal\u201d immigrants in 2017. This was twice the number arrested in Barack Obama\u2019s final year as president.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious concerns, of upending the lives of thousands of people and disrupting families and communities, the immigrant crackdown has also triggered a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on crime reporting across the country. Undocumented immigrants who are the victims of crimes like robbery and sexual assault have refused to report them for fear of being handed over to ICE, according to police and immigration advocates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Police Department, which says it has \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to develop and maintain relations with its large immigrant and refugee population, says that it will not be responding to administrative warrants from ICE going forward.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer has requested a stay of removal for the carpenter on humanitarian grounds, the Post reports.

The Trump administration temporarily expanded this guest-worker program in 2017 while restricting other avenues of legal immigration, including the H-1B program for high-skilled workers. The Trump Organization is exactly the kind of company that relies on the H-2B visa program for low-skilled workers. Vox reviewed recruiting files submitted to the US Department of Labor for two Trump properties in Florida (including Mar-a-Lago) and one in New York from the start of 2016 through the end of 2017.

Mar-a-Lago jobs allowed workers to make anywhere from $10.33 per hour for housekeepers to $13.43 for cooks and $11.88 for servers (no tips).\n\n\n\nApparently, no Americans wanted to work at Trump\u2019s Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., property, as Vox reports that no one applied for any of the available positions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Daily News notes that after the Trump administration got the cap raised on H-2B visas, \u201cthree days later Trump properties put in a request to bring on 76 guest workers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is no magic here.", "keywords": ["hired", "maga", "guest", "program", "employees", "jobs", "american", "foreign", "trump", "believe", "needed", "actually", "vox", "workers", "h2b", "trumps", "properties"], "polarity": 0.09428970152654365, "subjectivity": 0.4257651705020125},

The way it would work is that those on government assistance would receive less money on their EBT cards, and in return they\u2019d be sent a box of items including \u201cshelf-stable milk, ready to eat cereals, pasta, peanut butter, beans and canned fruit and vegetables.\u201d The boxes would not include fresh fruits or vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, recipients would receive canned meat.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence.

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["jeweler", "women", "panther", "work", "douriean", "jewelry", "adorned", "feel", "armored", "black", "designer", "think", "create", "heavy", "metal"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["wakanda", "till", "welcome", "panther", "stage", "venue", "york", "week", "black", "guests", "designer", "bnyfw"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her. We can\u2019t wait to see where her natural-hair journey might take her next.", "keywords": ["nyongo", "nyongos", "felt", "didnt", "hair", "wait", "took", "lupita", "allure", "takes", "journey", "relaxed", "natural"], "polarity": 0.02315238095238094, "subjectivity": 0.4495380952380952},

According to a number of the film\u2019s female stars, their characters\u2019 strength is a direct reflection of Wakanda\u2019s cultural history.\n\nBecause of the fictional country\u2019s historical isolationist worldview, a lot of things about Wakanda are vastly different from its neighboring nation states and other international actors. For instance, it\u2019s vast stores of vibranium and the development of fantastical technology. But in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Angela Bassett, who portrays Queen Mother Ramonda, said that Wakanda\u2019s culture is also the reason that Black Panther features so many dynamic women whose nurturing qualities are seen as signs of strength.\n\nActress Danai Guriria, who plays Okoye, further explained that because Wakanda was never invaded or colonized, its culture was predisposed to becoming more egalitarian along gender lines:\n\nThey were a nation uninterrupted. They got to go through their full evolution. Other countries on the continent were very interrupted and traumatized through colonization. Wakanda didn\u2019t have that disruption. It was such an advanced nation, it actually allowed for evolution of gender roles. It recognized that you allow all your citizens to advance to their full potential.\n\nLupita Nyong\u2019o portrays Nakia, a Wakandan spy who periodically slips pasts the country\u2019s airtight borders to collect valuable intel about the wider world around them. Though she\u2019s very much a love interest for T\u2019Challa, Nakia moves through Black Panther with a freedom and flexibility that means she\u2019s never expected to wait around for the king, something that inspired Nyong\u2019o:\n\nIt was such a breath of fresh air seeing men and women living in their power with out one dwarfing the other. To me it was reflective of the fact that sexism is learned. To see a society where that\u2019s not the focal point, where gender is not the fabric with which society is built and the delineations of sex are not oppressive, that\u2019s really cool. And it\u2019s possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EW piece with Black Panther\u2019s leading women also features a video and is chock full of all kinds of fabulous insight into the movie and you should definitely give it a read and watch before the film drops this Friday.

She could afford to take her time, looking over different parts before agreeing to the one she thought would be best for her career. But when director Ryan Coogler came to her and asked if she wanted to star in his adaptation of Black Panther, she was so eager to join the project, she didn\u2019t even pause to read the script first.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarvel called and said that Ryan was interested in me for a role in Panther, and I talked to him about it, and obviously everything was hush-hush, but he walked me through his initial ideas, and I thought, \u2018Wait a minute? This is a Marvel movie?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Nyong\u2019o shared that she agreed to play warrior Nakia without having read the script, first opening its pages after shooting began. She said it was because she was thrilled about the story Coogler was telling, about an African country that had \u201cmanaged to keep its autonomy and be self-determining\u201d because it was shielded from colonization. Nyong\u2019o, whose father is a prominent opposition leader in Kenyan politics, said the film\u2019s implicit political themes also drew her to the franchise.\n\n\u201cWe were creating an aspirational world where an African people are in charge of their own destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that really appealed to me and had the little girl inside me jumping for joy.

Coogler commented about her dedication to the project, saying she did \u201ca lot of homework\u201d on Black Panther in order to understand her role and the country of Wakanda. She spent months doing rigorous physical training for the complex stunt work, focusing on jujitsu and capoeira, and even injured herself during shooting.

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark.

Now, just shut up and stand there.

A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training.

Perhaps he hypersexualizes black men because he\u2019s the one out here fucking everyone. He\u2019s the one acting how black men are stereotypically supposed to act. He\u2019s the immoral one who refuses to curtail his sexual urges. He\u2019s the savage.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019d bet all the cash in Wakanda that Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal ain\u2019t the only women he\u2019s slept with while married to Melania. Of course, if two adults consent to sleeping with each other, there\u2019s nothing legally wrong with that, even if one is engaged in an extramarital affair. Morally? Definitely, but it\u2019s not illegal. Perhaps Married Donald is the white Wilt Chamberlain. Or, better yet, Wilt Chamberlain is the black Married Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, he\u2019s just doing what America and white Americans have done since America\u2019s inception, which is do dirt and then claim dark people are inherently dirty.\n\n", "keywords": ["donald", "whos", "women", "married", "sperm", "theres", "hes", "white", "black", "trump", "chamberlain", "hannity", "slept", "sean", "wilt"], "polarity": -0.03897849462365592, "subjectivity": 0.4680286738351255},

Misaki Collins recently posted a petition online to get signatures in support of having the campus name a planned residence hall after a woman of color. Despite the fact that the school is majority-minority, meaning that more minorities attend the school than do whites, every building on campus is named after white men except two, named for white women.\n\nAs Collins\u2019 petition circulated, she received an email from Nancy Kolsti, a spokeswoman for the university and a candidate for an honorary doctorate in Beckyology. The email stated that the petition imposed \u201ca quota system, and, to me, that is a form of reverse racism.\u201d\n\nKolsti added: \u201cUNT buildings should be named after individuals who are deserving of such an honor\u2014not individuals who are chosen to fill a quota system that you think the university should have because you feel that it is important \u2018to promote diversity in every aspect of the student experience.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother university spokesperson whose vision is not blurred from the teary-eyed butt-hurtedness of honoring someone other than a white person responded to the controversy in a manner consistent with not being a racist douchebag upset over something so insignificant.\n\n\u201cThe university believes that the naming of our buildings and how our campus appears are very much a part of the student experience and should reflect the core values we hold dear,\u201d UNT spokesperson Kelley Reese said regarding Kolsti\u2019s email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one who is often accused of reverse racism, I\u2019d like to advise Misaki Collins on the new brand of colonizers who cast allegations of reverse racism, equating stupid shit like naming buildings or using the word \u201cwypipo\u201d with police officers\u2019 disproportionate shooting of black boys in the face, banks\u2019 systematic rejection of black mortgage applications or the continued underfunding of schools in black neighborhoods.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s all the same.\n\nReese also said that Kolsti was expressing her view as a private citizen, not as a university official ... even though Kolsti was talking about the school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd is employed by the university.\n\nAnd sent the original message from her university email address.\n\nKolsti obviously assumed that the new building would be named in her honor. I have no evidence of this, but why else would she care who the building is named after? I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWell, her name is Nancy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, while it is true that our research shows that 86 percent of all Nancys want to speak to the manager, the only reason anyone would care about something so trivial is that she just didn\u2019t like women of color and was using the term \u201creverse racism\u201d as a tactic to stop diversity, which would be ...\n\nWait, I think I just discovered the first case of reverse reverse racism.

You are obviously good at whatever you do ... and racism. You are very good at racism.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m glad you brought to my attention how much less advanced my \u201cshit race\u201d is than every other race. Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me.

Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways.

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based on its being not only the sole place on Earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, it is centuries ahead of anywhere else on the planet. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear that he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this with Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on Earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther\u201d). Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by way of New York City.

Lately, the jujitsu of reverse racism has manifested itself in the ugliest, most virulent form imaginable:\n\nThe word \u201cwypipo.\u201d\n\nIf you look in the comments section anytime the phrase is used on the internet, you will find accusations of racism\u2014even when it is based on actual fact. Apparently, it is OK to make political policy based on an infinitesimally small number of immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries whose citizens have never committed an act of terror on American soil, but pointing out the statistically accurate fact that white people still support Trump is an act of prejudice. If you dare speak of the available data and facts to show the disposition of white America, you, too, can witness the privileged pushback that can be summed up in one statement: \u201cNot me. I\u2019m white, and I\u2019m not like that, therefore you\u2019re just a racist.\u201d\n\nApparently, Donald Trump is a racist.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Sweet Potato Head addressed a joint session of Congress to lay out his agenda for the country. Embedded among his stiff-arming his responsibility as commander in chief, his spectacular plan to create a magical health care system and his continued contorting to pat himself on the back for winning the election was an off-putting, \u201calt-right\u201d dog whistle addressed to one group of Americans:\n\nWypipo.\n\nTrump did not talk to all of the country Tuesday night. He spoke to the conservative-base, middle-American Caucasians with whom his support lies. He didn\u2019t even talk to them. He whispered to them. He talked in hushed tones, hoping that the minorities and underclass didn\u2019t hear him. He gave the most racist speech ever. He gave a speech for white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe he knows that the people he excluded or vilified don\u2019t have the privilege, means or numbers to raise their voices in America\u2019s comments section like wypipo. The people who can\u2019t wait until the end of the year for a health care tax credit can\u2019t send him an angrily worded tweet. The vast majority of \u201cillegals\u201d who work, pay taxes and take care of their families are too preoccupied with survival to act like the pussy-hat-wearers who voted for Hillary and print T-shirts that say \u201cNot This White Woman.\u201d The millions of American Muslims who practice their religion peacefully don\u2019t have the option of showing outrage and pointing out that they aren\u2019t terrorists. The educated black people raising families can\u2019t put their fingers in the president\u2019s face and say \u201cHow dare he\u201d paint them as uneducated criminals.\n\nOnly wypipo can do that. That\u2019s why black people don\u2019t clog up the internet when Trump, Republicans and white America equate poverty, crime and ghettos with being black. It\u2019s why Mexican Americans don\u2019t make a stink when conservatives give a 10-minute applause break for a border wall. It\u2019s why he can denigrate Muslims, Hispanics, black people, the poor and every nonwhite group in front of the people elected to represent this country with no repercussions. If any of those groups lived with the privilege of wypipo, someone would have screamed at Trump when he spoke of the hordes of marauding Mexicans or the lawless Chicago streets. But only a white guy could get away with yelling, \u201cYou lie\u201d during a presidential address.\n\nEven though he was speaking to wypipo, I know that not every single white person supports the orange agenda, just as I do not claim to speak for every black person who uses \u201cthe w-word.\u201d I don\u2019t even speak for every writer at The Root, but for me, the word \u201cwypipo\u201d is a mirror. It is a tool of sarcasm. I like how upset white people get when they are painted with such a broad brush. It is beautiful in its revelatory powers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I also understand why you think it is unfair to lump you in with the \u201calt-right\u201d racists, Trump supporters and xenophobes. I would guess that it is pretty disheartening to read or hear when you are genuinely trying to make an effort to reach out with understanding.

A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster.

I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10.

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment.

Not in the sense that you\u2019ve seen anything like it before (trust me, you haven\u2019t), but rather that seeing it feels like coming home.\n\n\n\nFor all of its technological wonders and visual delights, Black Panther is, in its deepest heart of hearts, the type of family drama that nearly everyone can relate to in one way or another. Before diving into the present-day status quo established in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther opens with a promise and a betrayal\u2014fraternal twins of fate whose very existences immediately give the movie\u2019s plot a Shakespearean sense of grandeur and intimacy.\n\nThe promise is of Wakanda itself\u2014symbolized in a brief, but powerful flashback to a younger T\u2019Chaka (played in his prime by Atandwa Kani, whose father, John Kani, portrays the older T\u2019Chaka both here and in Civil War) checking in on a covert intelligence mission in the United States. The betrayal is what T\u2019Chaka finds, a revelation that both changes the course of Wakanda\u2019s future and gets at the heart of one of the more difficult ideas Black Panther repeatedly asks: If Wakanda is the mighty beacon of excellence it claims to be, why hasn\u2019t it done more to help the world?\n\nThe question rises to the surface of the Royal Family\u2019s minds once again after an encounter with Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) inadvertently draws CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) into the Wakandans\u2019 midst. The country\u2019s culture of secrecy and isolationism is an important and fascinating part of its larger mythos, but it\u2019s one that Black Panther purposefully inspects and challenges through the various drives and goals of its characters.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs its newly crowned King, T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is deeply vested in hewing to tradition, as his mother and father taught him. But a certain degree of uncertainty about how to embody a king\u2019s identity gives him the opportunity for some flexibility in his approach to shaping Wakanda\u2019s relationship to the world. Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), a spy who frequently travels beyond Wakanda\u2019s borders and has seen the strife and poverty in the wider world, is adamant that Wakanda could become a larger force for global good. Describing Okoye (Danai Gurira) as simply the general of the Dora Milaje isn\u2019t entirely accurate; she is in almost every sense of the title, Hand to the King, second only to his mother Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett). Together, they represent a strong bloc in favor of Wakandan traditionalism\u2014a bloc that would be completely unified were it not for Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), T\u2019Challa\u2019s genius, teenaged sister who\u2019s more interested in her scientific research at the Wakandan Design Group than family politics.\n\nThough the Royal Family and those closest to them are not always in agreement with one another, there\u2019s a balance to their nuclear unit which strengthens the Wakandan throne. The stability of the Royal Family ensures the trust and allegiance of the other Wakandan tribes\u2014like the Jabari, a group of anti-technological people who live in the mountainous northern region of the country, where they\u2019re led by M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke). Each of the Wakandan tribes is a distinct cultural presence led by different figureheads who all have their own political agendas.\n\nWakanda\u2019s inner workings are intricate and at times strained, but the status quo of remaining isolated works specifically because the Wakandans put their own survival first. Given the specter of colonialism on the African continent, that\u2019s understandable. However, the promise of Wakanda introduced during the film\u2019s opening is, in a striking and beautiful way, the audience\u2019s entryway into seeing how someone from the outside might grow to resent the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Black Panther is actually one of the more grounded and human Marvel films, Erik Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) villainous motivation is immediately understandable and completely relatable. If you knew what he knew, you\u2019d want to fight T\u2019Challa, too. Even in the moments where Killmonger\u2019s ambition to take the Wakandan throne boil over into overt bloodthirstiness, there\u2019s a voice in the back of your head reminding you what brought him to that point, and why maybe he has a point.\n\nIn a very literal way, Killmonger is the embodiment of the pain and anguish that comes along with being a black American who is unable to trace their familial roots back more than a few generations. Those gaps in ancestral knowledge are the direct result of families being murdered and wiped from the historical record, never to be fully known or remembered by their descendants. Killmonger\u2019s trauma is something that T\u2019Challa can\u2019t fully grasp, given the nature of his own upbringing. The two become diametrically opposed to one another, despite the fact that they are both fundamentally fighting for the betterment of their shared people.\n\nOf all the players in T\u2019Challa\u2019s orbit, Killmonger is the most extreme in his beliefs that Wakanda should be both open and expansionist. His vision is the all-too-understandable conclusion that dawns on every single black person once we consider everything an open Wakanda could be and mean, not just for the world, but specifically for the African diaspora. Black Panther asks the kinds of questions about Wakanda that aren\u2019t fun to think about, but are important all the same. How might the course of history been changed had the country not been closed off? What might global blackness look and feel like in a world like that? The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a world in which those questions can be asked in earnest and the Wakandan people have to grapple with the possible answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther would not have been as strong a movie if it didn\u2019t contemplate those heavier concepts, but the film also never misses a beat to be absolutely joyous and reverent about Wakanda\u2019s magnificence. Though Wakanda is an Afrofuturist wonderland, it\u2019s still meant to be an actual place on Earth and it feels like it. Director Ryan Coogler and cinematographer Rachel Morrison craft breathtaking, on-the-ground shots that give Wakanda\u2019s streets a texture and vibrancy that blends old-world hustle and bustle with gleaming accents of the future.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also pleasantly surprising how funny Black Panther is. While the movie\u2019s tone never dips too, too deep into abject misery, there are enough moments of solemnity that when a joke about T\u2019Challa\u2019s dad sandals pops up, you\u2019re not really prepared to laugh quite that hard. Though the movie\u2019s comedic moments land squarely, they\u2019re also subtle, often bubbling up suddenly\u2014almost as if willed into existence by the chemistry between the cast. There\u2019s a palpable love between T\u2019Challa, Ramonda, Shuri, and Okoye that propels them forward as a unit; at the same time, there\u2019s a complicated understanding between them all and Killmonger that keeps the plot compelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s action builds effortless, upward momentum that immediately reminds you that you\u2019re still in a humongous Marvel movie. Thankfully, there\u2019s no big, glowing, CGI deus ex machina waiting as Black Panther\u2019s ultimate big bad, but the film\u2019s penultimate major battle is chock full of just enough explosions to scratch your itch if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to say about Black Panther because, like Wakanda, it\u2019s an embarrassment of riches that you can\u2019t really hope to fully unpack in one sitting. It\u2019s the kind of Marvel movie that definitely benefits from more than a single viewing, and it\u2019s one that\u2019ll draw you in\u2014and blow your mind every single time.", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "wakandas", "panther", "family", "theres", "tchalla", "black", "marvels", "marvel", "epic", "wakandan", "shakespearean"], "polarity": 0.12236610288935874, "subjectivity": 0.46050496660961776},

If you\u2019re sitting on a chair at a cubicle right now or standing in line at Einstein\u2019s Bagels, \u201cperfectly justifiable reasons to hate the New England Patriots\u201d permeate the air and will bounce off your forehead like drops of sleet.\n\nYou can hate them because they\u2019ve been caught cheating numerous times. You can hate them because they seem to receive a mysteriously generous amount of questionable refereeing in their favor. You can hate them because they\u2019re from Boston, which is notorious for possessing the most insufferable (and insufferably racist) sports fans (and people).\n\nYou can hate them because their owner, coach and star quarterback are unabashed \u201cMAGA\u201d bots. You can hate them because they\u2019re really fucking good and they\u2019ve been really fucking good for 15 years despite never really being dominant. I\u2019ve never seen a team that, along with being great, also frequently got so damn lucky, and you can hate them for that. You can hate them because Tom Brady is Scientologist-adjacent. If you want to be petty, you can hate them because Robert Kraft is low-key ugly.\n\nAnd yes, it is fine to hate them because Bill Belichick seems to possess a white-skill-position-player generator. Wes Walker. Rob Gronkowski. Danny Woodhead. Chris Hogan. Julian Edelman. Danny Amendola. Rex Burkhead. THESE ARE NOT THE NAMES OF REAL PEOPLE! THESE ARE THE NAMES OF PEOPLE CREATED BY A WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR. Besides New England, there are, like, three white running backs and receivers in the NFL total. The Patriots, however, have 952 of them.\n\nThis cannot be a coincidence. It just can\u2019t. If you ordered a pepperoni pizza for a party and you opened the box and saw that one slice had 95 pepperonis while the other seven slices had five total, you\u2019d suspect something was up\u2014that the pizza-maker wanted one person to have all the pepperoni. You don\u2019t know why the pizza-maker made this arbitrarily specific decision, but you know a decision was made. SOMEONE IN NEW ENGLAND IS MAKING THE DECISION TO REFRESH THE BATTERIES FOR THE WHITE-SKILL-POSITION GENERATOR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, when you have an unusual number of white players on a team\u2014football and basketball particularly\u2014the way they\u2019re talked about changes. Words like \u201cgrit\u201d and \u201chardworking\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d find their way into the columns and comments and news stories about them. They\u2019re \u201cgood locker-room guys\u201d and \u201ccoaches on the field.\u201d They \u201chustle\u201d and they possess an unlimited amount of \u201cguile\u201d and \u201ctoughness.\u201d Their \u201cwork ethics\u201d are impeccable because they\u2019re true \u201cstudents of the game.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Gronkowski is basically white LeBron. And by \u201cwhite LeBron\u201d I mean \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d Or that Danny Woodhead ran a 4.3-second 40. If they\u2019re white athletes, they\u2019re succeeding because of their smarts and their character.\n\nSo yes. Hate away. Hate to your heart\u2019s content. Drink a hate smoothie and garnish it with some hateful cilantro.

The hardest part was creating an entire country, more technologically advanced than anywhere on the planet, based around an indestructible super-metal that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. The process started with a single question.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions [Coogler] was trying to ask and answer is what it means to be African in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d co-writer Joe Robert Cole told io9. \u201cWhich I think, in the back of your mind with this property, is always there.\u201d\n\nCole was one of the first people hired to make Black Panther, before even Coogler himself. He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible. And so it was really world-building in its truest form.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "panther", "wanted", "creating", "beachler", "complicated", "coogler", "lot", "exhilarating", "vibranium", "black", "cole", "process"], "polarity": 0.1521029814067789, "subjectivity": 0.44748481476329593},

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed.

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark.

Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either.

A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["negro", "does", "mother", "church", "movie", "charlie", "magically", "white", "shit", "mr", "magical", "reasons", "negrod"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Before he went on to make Blade, Wesley Snipes campaigned long and hard to get the ball rolling on a live-action Black Panther adaptation in which he would have starred. Though the project never quite came to fruition, Snipes\u2019 description of that \u201890s Black Panther film is a fascinating taste of what might have been.\n\n\n\nSnipes spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how his own Black Panther project actually got much farther along in the production process than most people realize (if they knew about it at all). Multiple scripts were written, Snipes himself (who was a hot commodity throughout the early-to-mid \u201890s) was attached to star, and both Mario Van Peebles and John Singleton were in the running to direct.\n\nBut for all the potential Snipes\u2019 Panther might have had, comic books and movies based on them didn\u2019t have the same kind of cultural cache and relevance that they do today and not everyone was on board with the idea of sticking close to the source material. Though Snipes felt it was important to emphasize Wakanda\u2019s technological prowess\u2014something we\u2019ll definitely be seeing in Marvel\u2019s film\u2014others, like Singleton, thought it would be smarter to go in a different direction:\n\n\u201cJohn was like, \u2018Nah! Hah! Hah! See, he\u2019s got the spirit of the Black Panther, but he is trying to get his son to join the [civil rights activist] organization. And he and his son have a problem, and they have some strife because he is trying to be politically correct and his son wants to be a knucklehead.\u2019 \u201c I am loosely paraphrasing our conversation. But ultimately, John wanted to take the character and put him in the civil rights movement. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude! Where\u2019s the toys?! They are highly technically advanced, and it will be fantastic to see Africa in this light opposed to how Africa is typically portrayed.\u2019 I wanted to see the glory and the beautiful Africa. The jewel Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnipes also described a number of other angles for the film that would have focused on a version of T\u2019Challa who didn\u2019t grow up in Wakanda in the years before he became king. As odd as that may sound, bear in mind that the \u201890s were a very, very different time for Marvel and Black Panther. At the time, Marvel had recently sold off the film rights to a number of its characters in an attempt to stave off its impending bankruptcy.\n\nEven though Columbia Pictures was interested in potentially producing Snipes\u2019 Black Panther, technological and budgetary constraints proved to be insurmountable issues. CGI wasn\u2019t anything close to what it\u2019s like today and capturing the sheer grandeur of Wakanda would have called for a gargantuan budget. It\u2019s nice to think that there was almost an OG Black Panther film that we could have been looking back on with fondness (or derision, who knows) for years, but to hear the way Snipes describes his vision for T\u2019Challa\u2019s vibranium suit, perhaps it\u2019s best the movie never got made:\n\n\u201cActually, I figured it would be a leotard. A leotard with maybe some little cat ears on it. I would have to be in shape and just be straight bodied up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["reveals", "son", "wakanda", "panther", "wanted", "wesley", "snipes", "rights", "black", "featured", "project", "90s", "film", "movement", "africa", "civil"], "polarity": 0.1213378442545109, "subjectivity": 0.4921153846153847},

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["flight", "world", "airport", "enemies", "work", "men", "speak", "allies", "dont", "white", "going", "im", "know", "need"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

She could afford to take her time, looking over different parts before agreeing to the one she thought would be best for her career. But when director Ryan Coogler came to her and asked if she wanted to star in his adaptation of Black Panther, she was so eager to join the project, she didn\u2019t even pause to read the script first.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarvel called and said that Ryan was interested in me for a role in Panther, and I talked to him about it, and obviously everything was hush-hush, but he walked me through his initial ideas, and I thought, \u2018Wait a minute? This is a Marvel movie?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Nyong\u2019o shared that she agreed to play warrior Nakia without having read the script, first opening its pages after shooting began. She said it was because she was thrilled about the story Coogler was telling, about an African country that had \u201cmanaged to keep its autonomy and be self-determining\u201d because it was shielded from colonization. Nyong\u2019o, whose father is a prominent opposition leader in Kenyan politics, said the film\u2019s implicit political themes also drew her to the franchise.\n\n\u201cWe were creating an aspirational world where an African people are in charge of their own destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that really appealed to me and had the little girl inside me jumping for joy. To just have African people, black people, at the center of that narrative is so exciting.\u201d\n\nOf course, just because she didn\u2019t read the script first doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t committed. Coogler commented about her dedication to the project, saying she did \u201ca lot of homework\u201d on Black Panther in order to understand her role and the country of Wakanda. She spent months doing rigorous physical training for the complex stunt work, focusing on jujitsu and capoeira, and even injured herself during shooting. Nyong\u2019o also said she had to learn to speak with the accent actor Chadwick Boseman took on for the role, which meant utilizing clicking sounds. \u201cThere\u2019s three different clicks, like three different letters,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther comes out February 16 and we can\u2019t wait to see Nyong\u2019o in action.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter]", "keywords": ["nyongo", "panther", "script", "coogler", "read", "pumped", "different", "african", "wait", "lupita", "black", "role", "didnt", "sign"], "polarity": 0.1191919191919192, "subjectivity": 0.3822330447330447},

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either. A wayward white hand reaches for your hair? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A group of white people huddled on a sidewalk refuse to step aside when you attempt to walk past them? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

Not because I think it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase, but because I have no idea what it means. I\u2019ve never had anyone come up to me and ask me to apologize for my race or my name. Also, it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m probably \u201capologetically black,\u201d because, in my most honest moments, unfettered by the societal implications of class, race and social status, I must admit ... I kinda feel sorry for white people. Not all white people, but I imagine it must be hard going through life not recognizing downbeats and thinking paprika is spicy.\n\nYes, I am apologetically black.\n\nBut apparently some people in St. Joseph\u2019s, Minn., have been repeatedly forced to apologize for their whiteness because USA Today reports that posters saying \u201cUnapologetically White,\u201d \u201cEnd White Guilt\u201d and \u201cWe Have a Right to Exist\u201d popped up around town on Wednesday. The posters are all branded by the St. Cloud State White Student Union, although the college says it is not a registered organization on campus.\n\nHowever, the organization has a Facebook page named St. Cloud White Student Union and describes itself as such:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not even mad at the St. Cloud State White Student Union; I\u2019m just confused. Apparently, I have been spending my time in the wrong places because I\u2019m never around when people gang up to oppress the populace of ecru-colored martyrs.\n\nI was involved in the Black Student Union while I was in college, but I\u2019d love to attend a White Student Union event. Do they play pinochle like we play spades? Do they discuss how hard it is being white in Minnesota surrounded by so many other alabasterians? Are their field trips to kale farms and HWCUs? Do they throw an off-step show every year for the fraternities and sororities?\n\nOnce, at a Denny\u2019s around 3 a.m. in Goose Creek, S.C., while watching a 52-year-old white dude mop up a drunken white sorority girl\u2019s grits-vomit, I wondered what kind of crazy Caucasian hijinks he was involved in that led to waiting tables during the graveyard shift at a pancake restaurant, when he has every societal advantage and privilege. I mean, he was white! The throw-up girl wasn\u2019t even with me, but as I watched him roll that canary-yellow industrial mop bucket filled with water the color of disappointment and bad decisions, I said a silent prayer for that waiter, and then I told him I was sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike I said, I am apologetically black.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud State Student Union Facebook page seems to be disliked by most people, and the college and the city of St. Cloud have condemned the posters. Not because they are racist, but because the signs violate the town ordinance against stapling things to telephone poles. What would they expect from those thugs?\n\nBut for the record, I stand with the White Student Union. Someone has to do it. I can\u2019t imagine having control of the media; every part of the local, state and national government; the education system, the banking system, the economy; and politics and the entire damn country and still feeling sorry for myself like a 6-year-old who can\u2019t get an ice cream cone because he\u2019s already eaten too many cookies.

But actually seeing the commercial for what Hasbro is offering made me pause and feel something deeply emotional.\n\nIf you ask many comic book fans of color which characters they grew up loving, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll name a white character like Spider-Man, Wolverine, or Batman. To be fair, these characters are great, but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re exponentially more widely marketed across a variety of media than other characters and so people come to know and identify with them more readily.\n\nA big part of how we come to love characters has to do with how much we\u2019re exposed to them and how often we\u2019re able to see ourselves in them in a meaningful way. Reading as the Black Panther and his genius sister Shuri save the world in the pages of comics is one thing, but seeing young black children actually embody those characters while having fun is something much more powerful. That\u2019s what makes Hasbro\u2019s line of Black Panther toys and the way the company\u2019s marketing them so incredibly fantastic.\n\n\n\nIn the first ad the company released, a black boy dons T\u2019Challa\u2019s Black Panther mask and claws, while a black girl along with a non-black friend wield Shuri\u2019s panther gauntlets as the trio are transported from their backyard directly to Wakanda. Obviously, the mask and claws are plastic with a bit of circuitry in them and the gauntlets are a new kind of Nerf gun but to be clear\u2014you almost never see toy ads aimed at and starring black children, and starring as the leads no less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause characters of color have historically been relatively marginalized in movies, comics, and television, toys and commercials like this simply haven\u2019t existed before which is a shame in and of itself but has deeper consequences. Oftentimes, the first step towards becoming a fan of something or part of a larger fandom is finding a character that you can relate to when you\u2019re young and then seeing your relationship with them validated by the world around you.\n\n\n\nThat feedback loop of identification, and then affirmation, is what creates the ideas that \u201cI can be a hero too\u201d and \u201cthis fandom can be a place for me, as well.\u201d Toys and commercials like these, perhaps even more than the movies they\u2019re promoting, can have a way of creating lasting impressions and memories on kids for whom they\u2019re a gateway into a larger world of fantasy and scifi. Suddenly, they\u2014along with T\u2019Challa and co.\u2014are the ones defeating villains and protecting the planet. That kind of direct representation can have a profound impact on one\u2019s self-esteem in the long term.\n\nYes, these are just toys, but at the same time, they\u2019re so much more. They\u2019re an invitation\u2014an affirmation\u2014and something I wish I\u2019d had when I was growing up.", "keywords": ["world", "panther", "starring", "commercial", "young", "black", "toys", "way", "toy", "characters", "theyre", "understand", "seeing", "important"], "polarity": 0.17847673160173153, "subjectivity": 0.4506551484230054},

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated. Even though Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan has repeatedly warned me never to trust men with bangs, if I saw these motherfuckers in line at Target, I\u2019d call the 911 immediately.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in racial profiling, but if the operator asked me what was wrong, I\u2019d tell him or her: \u201cLook, I know these white people have someone chained up at the crib. I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment. Their bail has been set at $9 million apiece, according to CNN.

You might as well also list \u201ccompatible with oxygen\u201d and \u201chave never eaten my own spleen.\u201d\n\nAnyway, last week our president did something even more overtly racist than the last most overtly racist thing he did. And I have no doubt that he will continue to break his own standards of overtly racist behavior. Each day we might see or hear something we\u2019ve never seen before. He\u2019s basically Usain Bolt in 2008.\n\nAnd I\u2019m here today to defend him.\n\nAs a response to the report that he referred to Haiti, El Salvador and all of Africa as \u201cshithole countries,\u201d he was asked if he was a racist. His immediate reply (\u201cI am not a racist\u201d) stands counter to everything we know about him and everything we know about what constitutes racism. It also might be the truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe already know that, in the 2016 election, Donald Trump won nearly every measurable and meaningful white demographic: white men, white women, poor whites, rich whites, white people actually named \u201cDwight.\u201d And he won them with a five-word-long platform: \u201cI\u2019m famous and I\u2019m racist.\u201d\n\nThese are also the same people who voted for the senators and state representatives who\u2019d be expected to hold such an overtly racist president accountable. Who you\u2019d hope would have enough integrity to eschew a party line and stand for what\u2019s right. Of course, that hasn\u2019t come. And it hasn\u2019t\u2014and won\u2019t\u2014come because they agree with him. And they represent constituencies where the majority of the people in them do, too.\n\nPerhaps they\u2019re too \u201cdecent\u201d and/or savvy to be as blunt as the president is. But they elected him and continue to support him so he can say and do the things they can\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if the majority of white Americans possess these racist beliefs\u2014and, again, our elections would seem to prove that they do\u2014racism would seem to be the standard. And if something is the standard, it\u2019s not special or distinguishable. At least not special or distinguishable enough to bother distinguishing it.\n\nAnd if this is true, Donald Trump is telling the truth. He is not racist because, for white people, racism is the default. A mundanity. What separates him from the majority of white Americans is his platform and his personal brand of fucklessness.\n\nIt would have been more accurate and more telling if he\u2019d replied instead, \u201cI am not a racist. I am just a white man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, if he\u2019s not going to lie, he might as well just tell the entire truth.

I\u2019ve compiled a short list of things that, while white guys feel totally comfortable doing, maybe they should let someone else try or just stop doing altogether.\n\nNeedlessly abbreviate words.\n\nNot too long ago, I was talking to a white colleague about referring someone for a potential job opening and my Caucasian homey said, \u201cYou should definitely consider her. She\u2019s a total natch for the role.\u201d\n\nHuh? The fuck is a \u201cnatch,\u201d bruh and should we be referring to women like that, you know, like in the workplace, like right now and shit?\n\nThen he was like, \u201cNoooo, noooo, man.

When I asked him who I need to look for (because, you know, *wink wink*, gonna get that hook-up) he just stared at me. Then I remembered that white dudes make more money than everyone else and he could actually afford the shit I\u2019m breaking my own bank to front to get. Then I called my homie and two days later I picked up my new TV in the parking lot beside a Costco.\n\nOrder shots for the table.\n\nIt always starts the same way. You\u2019re out with your white friends having a few drinks, maybe watching the game, or doing something else alcoholically benign when the server brings over a tray of Jameson shots and then Ryan from Account Services does that dumb ass shrug while saying, \u201cUh oh, looks like it\u2019s a round of Jamo for the crew!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you thought this was just a benevolent gesture of friendship, you thought wrong. As soon as you accept that first shot, you\u2019re agreeing to take a trip down the road to white boy wasted that only ends with you sitting at your desk the next morning wearing Ray Bans indoors, guzzling a Pedialyte, and trying to ignore Ryan when he says, \u201cHey brah, I\u2019m sorry if things got a little crazy last night. I\u2019ll buy you a new phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd all you can do is shake your head as you pick glitter out of your beard.\n\n\n\nCarry guns.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that white men are more prone to violence or have some natural inclination to shoot people. What I am saying is that I\u2019m not clear on what the parameters are for getting shot by a white guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear me out. When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["stop", "maybe", "guys", "men", "things", "white", "charge", "black", "letting", "wrong", "im", "probably", "know", "saying"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

All Models of Color Must Maintain Their Melanin Throughout the Making of the Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s never a good look if a model or actor has to set aside his or her blackness for the sake of selling a product. FYI, I wasn\u2019t speaking figuratively; I said what I said. If your model must remove, lighten or disrobe their skin, you\u2019re probably going down the wrong creative path. Yes, Michael Jackson made it work for the \u201cBlack or White\u201d video, but you ain\u2019t Michael, and you dang sure ain\u2019t Tyra Banks killing \u2019em with your shoulders alongside the King of Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Don\u2019t Exclude Us\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re selling pumpkin-spice lattes with a side of cottage cheese out of the back of a Volkswagen Beetle at a Taylor Swift concert; somewhere, somehow, there\u2019s a black person who may be into it. In many ways, we\u2019re just like you, so don\u2019t leave us out. The last thing you want us to do is play a round of \u201cFind the Negro\u201d on your ad. It won\u2019t end well.\n\n5. Along Those Same Lines, Don\u2019t Assume We\u2019re Monolithic\n\nSo, you know how some white people like the color blue, while others prefer purple or yellow or orange? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with black people. What works for some of us may not work for others (case in point: the age-old debate of grits vs. Cream of Wheat). One size does not fit all, and one marketing tactic does not work for the masses\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, for every living being shall get into formation accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Don\u2019t Try to Be Us\n\nWhen marketing to or for a black person, it\u2019s always preferred that you use an actual black person. Aesthetically, it\u2019s a lot more pleasing.\n\n7. We Give No Cares About Your Apology\n\nThe damage is done. The racism has been distributed widely across multiple platforms and we screenshot the hell out of it, so who cares what you have to say after the fact? I\u2019m sure most brands don\u2019t intentionally sit down and say, \u201cHow can we eff with the most historically disenfranchised and oppressed group of people of all time?\u201d But unfortunately that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s impact vs. intent, and the former overshadows the latter. If you have to apologize, consider issuing an apology in the form of more diverse hires and inclusive marketing practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. When All Else Fails, Just Use the Honey Bunches of Oats Lady or Michelle Obama\n\nWe love the ish out of both of these women and would never question their judgment or discernment.

Like, I\u2019m sure we all could go on and on about how terrible this year truly was to each and every last one of us. Still, the year had some high points, which we pointed out earlier this week, but in the spirit of balance and equilibrium (it took me all that I had to not make a Star Wars crack, since I finally went to go see The Last Jedi), I think reflection on the super, terrible year that was 2017 is necessary, even if that means reflecting on its low points for us as a people.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the top 10 disappointing moments (in no particular order) black people experienced in the year 2017:\n\n\n\n1. White People\n\nThis ... is a given. In 2017, perhaps the greatest moments of discomfort, borderline instability and downright asininity experienced by our large and expansive community could be most certainly traced back to Chet and them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom President Cheeto Dandruff yucking it up in the White House and threatening to start a war every time he tweeted with his sausage fingers to white people trying to install a whole (alleged) child molester in another political office in Alabama to chanting about \u201cwhite lives\u201d in Charlottesville, Va., with their busted tiki torches, white folx showed no sign of waking the fuck up and instead continued to plead that we save them from themselves.\n\n2. The Atlanta Falcons Giving Up a 25-Point Lead in the Super Bowl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2017, it was announced that the Atlanta Falcons would face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51. And after President Radioactive Cheeto Dust was elected to office at the conclusion of 2016, it became quite clear that this aforementioned game was about to become an unintentional, extended metaphor for that year.\n\nIndeed, it was the ultrablack, ultralit Falcons versus Trump\u2019s America the New England Patriots and Tom \u201cTrump Is My Boi\u201d Brady. And for a minute, during that very game, it looked as if the Falcons were gonna take the win, with a 25-point lead to boot.\n\n... and then they blew that lead to lose to Trump\u2019s America the Patriots by six points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of the most embarrassing Ls we took this year, and to be quite honest, I\u2019ll never get over it.\n\n3. The Cancellation of Underground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am honestly still too angry to describe how unjust it was that Underground was canceled but shows like, oh, I don\u2019t know, Megyn Kelly Today are still chilling on the air.\n\nIt was an unnecessary loss of a show that focused on aspects of black liberation during slavery rather than the kind of torture porn that Hollywood is used to peddling. The cancellation was especially hard to swallow when it was announced that HBO had its own alternate-universe slavery fan fiction in development (thankfully, that looks like it\u2019s no longer happening).\n\nHowever, despite its unjust cancellation, the search for a new home network for Underground continues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandra Shipp, Tinashe and Colorism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorism. It is a subset of oppression that precedes your existence and mine. And yet, to this day, black people can\u2019t seem to get ourselves together when it comes to this topic. Such was the case this year as well.\n\nTinashe was the earliest example as she implied that being light-skinned had hurt her odds of succeeding in the music industry, even though she had not done anything remarkable as of late, and she simultaneously failed to call out the over-saturation of stars who look like her in the business, thereby causing her lamentations to fall on deaf ears.\n\nAlexandra Shipp was just another example of this when, a couple of weeks ago, the actress claimed that black people had been the most racist to her for her entire life. This was after a Storm superfan came into her Twitter mentions about hoping that Marvel would cast a dark-skinned Storm for a hypothetical X-Men franchise reboot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone agreed with how the fan approached the ever present problem of characters like Storm being portrayed by light-skinned actresses, but I think most of us can agree that the actress (a word I use lightly) took the conversation in a direction that didn\u2019t even make any damn sense.\n\nAnd in 2017, we should be able to do better.\n\n5. Russell Simmons Proved How Tight Sexual Predators Can Be\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was a shit year, no doubt, but it also proved to be, for the most part, a year of reckoning for men who had done some dirt in the dark. The domino effect started with Harvey Weinstein, and folks are still out here in these streets being rightfully exposed. And Russell Simmons was among those in the carnage.\n\nAfter Terry Crews came forward about being sexually assaulted by WME\u2019s Adam Venit (a moment that was very, very important for male survivors), Crews also was very candid about the folx who had tried to silence him and, in turn, exposed Simmons\u2019 damning email to Crews in which he attempted to tell Crews to \u201clet it go.\u201d It was a disgusting development, and no one was surprised when Simmons was subsequently accused of sexual assault, too. However, folx who were familiar with Simmons\u2019 Rush Card scams and Kimora Lee\u2019s stories about him knew that this was part of an already trifling pattern of behavior.\n\n6. The Fallout from VerySmartBrothas\u2019 \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d Piece\n\nThe moment I saw the headline \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d come across my timeline, I knew that all hell was about to break loose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into the specifics of the piece (mostly because you can read it here), but Damon Young\u2019s article got at a point that cisgender straight men had been ignoring for a long time: that they are the most privileged in our community.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as easy to refute coming from a fellow cis, straight black man, so many of Young\u2019s detractors, in turn, went after prominent black women who had shared the article\u2014the chief example being Jemele Hill, who they had all fake supported weeks prior. It was an ever present example of the kind of hypocritical bullshit black women are confronted with every damn day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Time: The Kalief Browder Story Reminds Us of Everyone We\u2019ve Lost to an Unjust Justice System\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2016, it was announced that Jay-Z and his team were putting together a documentary about the life, times, and completely unnecessary and avoidable death of Kalief Browder. The documentary finally debuted this year, and while it was something we sorely needed, it was also a painful reminder of all the black people we had lost thus far to an unjust \u201cjustice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also served as a harrowing admonisher of the effects that racism and white supremacy can have on our bodies and minds, too, which we were reminded of after his mother\u2019s (Venida Browder) untimely death last year and Erica Garner\u2019s recent hospitalization.\n\n8. Black Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Called Out Racism and Was Fired by L\u2019Oreal\n\nIn a year full of watershed moments when women snatched back the mic from a society that constantly seeks to silence us, it was particularly angering when Munroe Bergdorf did just that and was punished for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, L\u2019Oreal was all for profiting off her image as a black trans woman and her ties to those respective communities, but as soon as she attempted to speak on behalf of them, L\u2019Oreal was like, \u201cNah.\u201d Combine this with instances like Jemele Hill\u2019s, and it\u2019s another example of these corporations wanting \u201cdiversity\u201d without teeth. Performative nonsense.\n\n9. That Racist Dove Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be real. Since the goal of any sensible corporation or business is to make a boatload of cold, hard, stinking cash (hello, capitalism), no one is expecting them to be super-\u201cwoke,\u201d empathetic entities.\n\nHowever.\n\nIn the spirit of getting as much money as fucking possible, you would think they could at least appeal to the most common denominator of their demographics and have people on deck to make sure they are not racially insulting a huge chunk of their base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think.\n\nBut this year, that was not the case with Dove. Dove made it excruciatingly obvious that it has no black people in its public relations/marketing department when it released a commercial that showed a dark-skinned black woman taking off a brown shirt and morphing into a white woman.\n\nTo be forthcoming, it wasn\u2019t the only beauty company with a racist ad this year. Nivea joined in on the fun by putting out its \u201cWhite Is Purity\u201d ad and got the social media flogging it deserved. Yet Dove\u2019s ad happened to be a bit more biting because black people are a huge piece of its base and because there\u2019s something very visceral about seeing a black woman morphing into a white woman in an ad that is not Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d video\u2014especially considering the history of racist soap advertisements in America and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dave Chappelle\u2019s Return\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, after years of being off the air and mostly out of the limelight, Dave Chappelle prepared for what looked to be a roaringly victorious return to television.\n\nThis was something black folx had been anticipating and cheering on for a long time. After watching Chappelle walk away from a $50 million contract and refuse to be Comedy Central\u2019s dancing monkey (and thereby get branded \u201cunstable\u201d because of it), we were all excited for him to stick it to the man and make a glorious comeback via Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he surely did return, but it wasn\u2019t the unanimous victory some of us were hoping for.\n\n\n\nWith his Netflix specials, it was clear that Chappelle had not lost his sharp comedic edge and that he was still 100 percent on point about the subtleties and not-so-subtleties of white supremacy and how its food chain works (e.g., \u201cWhite women not liking their cut\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was also very clear that Chappelle may not have completely crossed over into 2017 with the rest of us. This was particularly the case with his Bill Cosby-heavy rape jokes (e.g., \u201cHe rapes but he saves!\u201d), and his weirdly obsessive jokes at the expense of queer and trans folx.\n\nIt was fairly disappointing, to say the least, to see someone willing to push the envelope in one area of oppression (racism) and willfully refusing to adapt to the times in other areas (homophobia and transphobia).\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it was surely gonna be an omen of what was to come in 2017: that killing our darlings and letting down our idols was going to be oh so necessary ... as there was absolutely no guarantee that they were going to grow and change with us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what an omen it was.", "keywords": ["2017", "disappointing", "moments", "experienced", "simmons", "example", "women", "woman", "unjust", "white", "black", "racist", "straight"], "polarity": 0.04550587067253737, "subjectivity": 0.4992853288686623},

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R.

However, because her show is so popular, and her audience as gullible enough to fall for alternative facts as much of the electorate, Mathew Knowles felt compelled to respond.\n\n\n\nPapa Knowles did not send a lengthy fax to The Wendy Williams Show like he was Aretha Franklin. No, no. Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange\u2019s pappy kept it local and spoke with Houston\u2019s Fox News 26 anchor Jonathan Martin to let these fools know that he\u2019s not going to get jumped by Tina Knowles, her new husband, Richard Lawson, and a spare Beyonc\u00e9 cousin at the hospital if he shows up to see his baby deliver more grandbabies.\n\n\n\nKnowles explained that contrary to what some would say, he communicates with Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange weekly. Though it may have seemed like a bit of a case of doing the most, Knowles also showed Martin actual texts from Beyonc\u00e9. Texts like, \u201cJust thinking of you. I miss you. I love and appreciate you.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m actually surprised that anyone is allowed to do this. Sure, Mathew Knowles gave Beyonc\u00e9 life, but Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s life is very guarded from the rest of the world. Then again, if I got a text from Beyonc\u00e9, I\u2019d show y\u2019all\u2019s asses, too, unless she made me sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter settling that urban myth, Knowles also tackled comparisons to the legendary patriarch of the Jackson clan, Joe Jackson. I feel like I\u2019ve heard Knowles smack-smack-smack those comparisons away years ago, but nevertheless, he explained: \u201cYou can\u2019t equate me to Joe Jackson. I never hit my kid. I\u2019m educated. I understand the business world.\u201d\n\nThis is a read of Papa Joe, but since I can\u2019t spot the lie, I\u2019m going to move forward.\n\nAs for Solange, Knowles said he was oh so proud of her\u2014maybe even the most\u2014because she refused to be the pop star he and the label tried to mold her into, yet managed to find success all the same. That is so sweet. And shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nY\u2019all, obviously, Mathew Knowles pissed his daughters off with those stories of thotting and making babies with women not named Tina Knowles Lawson, but of course, Beyonc\u00e9 still speaks to her daddy. It\u2019s her father. She\u2019s Southern. She might\u2019ve cursed him out once or thrice, but she\u2019s not going to revoke his text-messaging privileges or say, \u201cI\u2019ll choke you with the umbilical cord if you come \u2019round me after my water breaks.\u201d\n\nLet it go.\n\nFinally\u2014and pull your screens closer because this is important and frightening\u2014Knowles says he is working on a stage play based on the story of Destiny\u2019s Child from his perspective.

Do we want the story of Destiny\u2019s Child to come by way of a stage play overseas that may eventually come stateside if it makes some money?\n\nObviously, since Knowles owns the name, he doesn\u2019t really give a damn what we say, but you know, I thought I would ask y\u2019all.

It's not quite Hotep, but if you're woke, you've allowed yourself to see what's real: systemic racism and a very strong disadvantage for people of color all over the world.\n\nUsually, black people are the most woke because the disenfranchisement is happening to us, but there have been more and more white people who are speaking up and speaking out. Shout-out to the white people who are woke!\n\nHowever, every once in a while, a black person questions why HBCUs exist or claims we don't need Black History Month or says she'd never hire someone with a ghetto name, all while bearing a ghetto name. Those people are the opposite of woke. Those people are sleep, sleepy\u2014in fact, the sleepiest people on the planet. Here's a list of black celebrities who are catching up on all their z\u2019s.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article contains a tweet that some may find offensive.\n\n\n\n1. Stacey Dash\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom her blatant support of Donald Trump to her claim that black people don't need Black History Month and soooo much more, Stacey Dash is just soaking up all the sleep. I guess that's how she got her good looks because \u2026 Sleeping Beauty.\n\n\n\n2. Charles Barkley\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Barkley doesn't seem to like what #BlackLivesMatter is up to. When he appeared on radio's The Dan Le Batard Show With Stugotz, he said this:\n\n\n\nThe cops have made some mistakes; black people have made some mistakes. We have to sit back and be honest with each other. The cops have made some mistakes; that don\u2019t give us the right to riot and shoot cops. We need the cops, especially in the black community. We as black people, we\u2019ve got to do better.\n\nSir, are you assuming that all protesters are rioting and shooting cops? Because that's not what's happening. There's more:\n\n\n\nThere is some reason why there\u2019s racial stereotypes, [because] some black people are crooks. Some of these black people out there are committing crimes. Let\u2019s don\u2019t sit there and act like all our hands are clean. We never get mad when black people kill each other; well, that always has bothered me. \u2026 I\u2019ve always said we as black people, if you want respect, you\u2019ve got to give each other respect. You can\u2019t demand respect from white people and the cops if we don\u2019t respect each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Maxwell\n\nMaxwell recently tweeted and deleted, \"This will not end good if we don\u2019t do something. #americanlivesmatter #whocaresaboutcolor #humanlivesmatter.\" And why did he do that?! One of our senior editors, Yesha Callahan, took him to task for the controversial hashtag, and he promptly blocked her and sent the following tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Chrisette Michele\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, this one is just \u2026 OK, so Chrisette Michele decided to hop on social media, tell everyone she's not a \"political genius\" and then go on in her social media manifesto about how she thinks boycotts are not the answer. Tell that to everyone who ever marched in Selma, Ala.; everyone who's ever been brutally hosed by police or attacked by dogs and who fought for change in America and lived to see it happen. We're still not as far as we could be as a nation, but we're in the Oval Office, performing on stages and owning many things because someone boycotted for us.\n\n5. Tyga\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTyga decided to get involved in the police-brutality conversation on Twitter in a series of tweets. He was making valid points about police involved in the shooting of unarmed black people and how he doesn't care whether or not they are innocent and that we need to speak up and vote. Then he made the fatal mistake of tweeting #AllLivesMatter. And black journalist Cory Townes went all the way in.\n\n6. Wendy Williams\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWendy Williams made the HBCU comment heard 'round the world when she said, \"I would be really offended if there was a school that was known as a historically white college. We have historically black colleges. What if there was the National Organization for White People only? There\u2019s the NAACP.\" She has since apologized for the error of her sleepy thinking, especially since Chevrolet snatched its checks from her grasp. And she even had Roland Martin on her show to school her on the topic. At least she learned something?\n\n\n\n7. Azealia Banks\n\nWhere do I begin? I don't even think I need to write anything here. I should just share why Azealia Banks said she lightened her skin:\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s important to discuss the cultural significance of skin bleaching anymore because i think that just as African-American people or just as black people in this world, you assimilate. And there are things that, I mean \u2026 you accept not out of necessity but things that kind of become norm because it\u2019s just happening all the time. I think that goes for black people or any minority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUhm, what?! That's not all.\n\n\n\nShe also said this:\n\n\n\nAlthough I\u2019m making a joke, all jokes come from a serious place. I think a big part of being a black person in America is \u2026 it\u2019s accepted\u2014people look at skin bleaching as something different, but I see it as \u2026 another assimilation thing. It\u2019s just a continuation of the falsification of self that comes with being a black person in America. That can extend to speaking clear English or doing really well in academia. Whatever it is that black people make fun of each other for. It\u2019s all a part of that respectable Negro stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGirl, no.\n\n8. Columbus Short\n\nAdvertisement\n\nY'all, I'm just going to leave this right here:\n\n9. Fetty Wap\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's a fun fact: Apparently, when your kids are mixed, it's hard to say \"Black lives matter\" \u2026 if you're Fetty Wap. *Rolls my good eye.* I get it. Fetty wanted us to care about the other half of his mixed children, but not like this.\n\n10. Keke Palmer\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis young starlet is typically such a joy to watch. Her personality is infectious, her country Chicago accent is adorable and she's got the kind of energy you want to be around. But then Keke Palmer's Twitter fingers got in the way while she was commenting on #BlackLivesMatter. She said that all lives matter because people are being murdered for religion, too. This is like going to an AIDS rally and asking someone to care because you have Parkinson's. Not the time, Keke, not the time.\n\n11. Pastor Darrell Scott\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDarrell Scott is pastor of the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland and burst onto the political scene last November when he pulled together a group of black pastors who were supposed to endorse Donald Trump for president. The Root\u2019s political editor, Jason Johnson, spoke with Scott, and after he realized how giddy the minister was about flying on Trump\u2019s private jet and the gold-plated seat belts he got to buckle, he knew he was dealing with the worst kind of opportunist\u2014one who's willing to sell his soul for gold.\n\n\n\n12. Justice Clarence Thomas\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is Clarence Thomas so \"sleep?\" Is it because he's a self-hating Uncle Ruckus type, who hates affirmative action and racial quotas, even though one could argue it was a form of affirmative action/a quota system that got him on the Supreme Court? (He didn\u2019t have the record to replace a lion like Thurgood Marshall.) Is it the fact that he never asked a question for, like, 10 years, and always sided with now-deceased super-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on everything? Could it have been what happened with Anita Hill? Or could he be sleep because he said this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corollary of that principle is that human dignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.\n\n13. Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis guy endorses Donald Trump, and even though he's a former brain surgeon, he's an idiot. Do you remember what Ben Carson said about Harriet Tubman on the $20?\n\n\n\nAndrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt. In honor of that we kick him off of the money. I love Harriet Tubman. I love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her. Maybe a $2 bill.\n\n14. Erykah Badu\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis sultry singer is a little more Hotep than she is sleep, but Erykah Badu's series of tweets about young girls and the pedophiles who can't stop gawking at them ruffled many feathers, including those of our associate editor, Kirsten West Savali. Badu placed the responsibility on these young women, telling them that they should dress less sexy. Wait, what?\n\nA couple of her tweets are below, but since then, Badu has woken up a bit more and is now donating funds from her upcoming show to the African American 490 Challenge, a partner of Enough SAID, the Michigan Women's Foundation campaign to raise money to test more then 10,000 rape kits found abandoned in storage at the Detroit Police Department. Good for her for learning!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Christina Milian\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone wanted to step up her relevancy. Christina Milian tweeted, \u201cAll lives Matter\u201d and was immediately met with venom. She then cleared everything up by admitting that she wasn't \"up to date with the hashtags.\" Yeah, girl, that's it. At least she was bold enough not to delete her tweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. Raven-Symon\u00e9\n\nI think Raven-Symon\u00e9 had to be the first black celebrity to declare that all lives matter. It was back in 2015 after then-presidential hopeful Martin O'Malley said that all lives matter at a rally and later apologized, Raven-Symon\u00e9 attempted to back him up, claiming that O'Malley didn't need to apologize. On The View she said this:\n\n\n\nI understand what the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d hashtag means. It came in conjunction with everything that was going on with the police in Ferguson. You have to be sensitive in that statement, but he is right, all lives matter. \u2026 I think you have to open yourself up. It should be \u201cAll lives matter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gag was when her white co-host Michelle Collins had to school her:\n\n\n\nWhy reappropriate something that was really such a powerful thing for the Black community, something that meant so much and still means so much? It\u2019s such a positive thing. Why make that about everybody? It\u2019s not about everybody.\n\nThen there was that time Raven-Symon\u00e9 said this:\n\n\n\nI\u2019m tired of being labeled. I\u2019m an American. I\u2019m not an African American; I\u2019m an American.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\n\n\nThank you to Ancestry.com actually for sending me my DNA test \u2026 I am from every continent in Africa, except for one, and I am also from every continent in Europe, except for one. And for the last 400 years, my family has been living in Virginia. How long do you have to be in one country before you\u2019re that?\n\nAnd then this after a TV host said that Michelle Obama looked like an ape (later, Raven-Symon\u00e9 went on to say that the first lady looked like a cat):\n\n\n\n\"I don\u2019t think he was saying it racist \u2026 Michelle, don\u2019t fire me from this right now, but some people look like animals. I look like a bird. So can I be mad if somebody calls me Toucan Sam?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there's her stance on the n-word\u2014that everyone should use it:\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t look at it as racism as the way your generation does. We\u2019re trying to move forward.\n\nOh, and let us not forget how she wouldn't hire anyone with a \"ghetto name\":\n\n", "keywords": ["16", "sleepiest", "sleep", "read", "lives", "dont", "white", "black", "think", "matter", "cops", "woke", "im", "know", "need"], "polarity": 0.07957679334979946, "subjectivity": 0.4339782354659654},

There are multiple shootings of black people at the hands of law enforcement that have left many families confused and in mourning; there was a sniper shooting that killed five police officers in Dallas; and I mostly fear that the violent and horrific stories aren't over.\n\nIn times like these, we should come together, lift one another up. But of course, we're not in a perfect world, so there are plenty of people who use this as a time to attempt to rip us apart. Those people say, \"White girls rock\" when we celebrate black excellence at Black Girls Rock! Those people don't understand why lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people get to be proud and straight people don't. Those people are perplexed by HBCUs.\n\nIt's these types of people who need all the seats in all the stadiums in the world. I have a message for you: It's not about you. Grow up and realize that you might not be racist, but you're dangerously close. Here are five things that should stop now.\n\n\n\n1. #AllLivesMatter\n\nHow many times does it need to be broken down so that it's officially broke?! #BlackLivesMatter exists only because of the racial disparities that leave many of our loved ones slain. It's a cry for recognition of our humanity. It's a response to the lives of people like Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Aiyana Stanley-Jones and the countless other black faces who lost their lives because of their melanin-rich skin. Their killers have consistently not faced any consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe use #BlackLivesMatter as a reminder that we matter, as an affirmation that despite the recurring killings, we should experience humanity, too. #AllLivesMatter is already implied, and trolls seem to think that when \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d is said, it somehow means that only black lives matter\u2014and that's definitely not the case.\n\n\n\n2. White History Month\n\nCan someone please tell me about how there's so little white history taught in schools\u2014so little, in fact, that there needs to be a full month dedicated to celebrating it? I'll wait. Oh, you can't? That's because every piece of history taught in school is saturated in whiteness. Black History Month was created as an acknowledgment and celebration of the impressive achievements of black people, who somehow managed to succeed despite the hatred, violence and inequality directed toward us. White History Month extends all year, and all we've been allowed is the shortest month of the year to celebrate and recognize our history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Stacey Dash once said that there shouldn't be a Black History Month, or Black Entertainment Television. I try not to acknowledge her ignorance, but seriously, does she not realize why these things were created in the first place?\n\n\n\n3. We Don't Need HBCUs\n\nWendy Williams put her Stacey Dash wig on and ignorantly claimed, \"I would be really offended if there was a school that was known as a historically white college. We have historically black colleges. What if there was the national organization for white people, only? There's the NAACP.\" Girl. Girl. GIRL. Wendy's father attended Lincoln, an HBCU, and she should know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese universities were created because black people were pushed out from getting a high-quality education at other universities. So we did what we always do: created our own. Now these schools are celebrated and upheld as accredited institutions. And let's be real; every college that isn't an HBCU is a predominantly white institution, sooo \u2026 we do have historically white colleges. And isn't the Ku Klux Klan a national organization for white people?\n\n\n\n4. The #BlackLivesMatter Movement Is the New KKK\n\nGood ol' boy Bill O'Reilly has compared Black Lives Matter to the KKK, calling BLM a hate group. Well, at least he admits that the KKK is a hate group. However, Black Lives Matter is the exact opposite. There is no hate there\u2014only love, support and frustration at the constant killing of black people. BLM activists have never killed anyone, strung anyone from trees, burned crosses or placed fear in the hearts of anyone with skin that doesn't match their own. But guess who has? The KKK.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Straight Pride\n\nFor those ignorant people who claim that there's a need for \u201cstraight pride,\u201d I've got only Prince side eyes for you. Straight is the default. Gay pride was created for the same reason Black History Month was: There was no celebration of, and mostly oppression of, homosexuality. So LGBT folks did what black people did: created a space for them to celebrate themselves and their lives and to have a place in this world, just like anyone else.", "keywords": ["world", "adjacent", "things", "lives", "created", "white", "history", "black", "matter", "racist", "label", "need", "month", "straight"], "polarity": 0.04316823699176641, "subjectivity": 0.47749978779390534},

And I don\u2019t say that lightly. There\u2019s just a lot of cool costumes and a lot of cool clothing. Lando\u2019s clothing, that\u2019s what I like. I was secretly super happy. His clothing is another spice of life. He takes pride in the clothing. It makes things easier. When people see you and you\u2019re debonair, they tend to want to give you stuff easier. [Laughs] Yeah, people are like, oh, this guy\u2019s got it together. He\u2019s obviously not starving, you know. He has enough leisure time to choose a nice outfit.\n\nGlover also talks about opportunities to be found in playing Lando as a younger man:\n\nI always like seeing younger characters when they are in younger times because it tells a lot about how they got to where they are. Like, when I was a teenager I felt like I knew a lot, but I didn\u2019t. By the time we meet him in Empire Strikes Back, he owns the city already. [Laughs] So, I wanted to show the person he was before that was even possible. Like, I don\u2019t even know if he thought that was possible at the time.\n\nThere\u2019s more fun details in the interview so head on over to EW to read the whole thing.

And I don\u2019t say that lightly. There\u2019s just a lot of cool costumes and a lot of cool clothing. Lando\u2019s clothing, that\u2019s what I like. I was secretly super happy. His clothing is another spice of life. He takes pride in the clothing. It makes things easier. When people see you and you\u2019re debonair, they tend to want to give you stuff easier. [Laughs] Yeah, people are like, oh, this guy\u2019s got it together. He\u2019s obviously not starving, you know. He has enough leisure time to choose a nice outfit.\n\nGlover also talks about opportunities to be found in playing Lando as a younger man:\n\nI always like seeing younger characters when they are in younger times because it tells a lot about how they got to where they are. Like, when I was a teenager I felt like I knew a lot, but I didn\u2019t. By the time we meet him in Empire Strikes Back, he owns the city already. [Laughs] So, I wanted to show the person he was before that was even possible. Like, I don\u2019t even know if he thought that was possible at the time.\n\nThere\u2019s more fun details in the interview so head on over to EW to read the whole thing.

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed. And they\u2019ll probably be scanning for a teacup to smack out of your hands.", "keywords": ["man", "woman", "ive", "look", "white", "khalid", "telling", "black", "person", "airports", "random", "probably", "tell"], "polarity": -0.01694444444444445, "subjectivity": 0.4044642857142857},

That was considerably more than their white female peers, of whom 72 percent felt similarly.\n\n\n\nThe poll was shared in a recent Washington Post newsletter centered on identity.\n\n\n\nBut what many people may find surprising, considering how white women have typically been front and center in the #MeToo movement, is that men of color were more likely than white women to label workplace sexual harassment a \u201cserious problem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA marginally higher number of nonwhite men, 74 percent, said that sexual harassment at work was a serious issue.\n\nA couple of important caveats around this one response. First, this was a follow-up question; the previous one asked respondents whether they thought sexual harassment in the workplace was a problem. This means we\u2019re looking at a pool of people who already acknowledged that sexual trespasses at work do exist and are a concern.\n\n\n\nAlso, the vast majority of these groups do consider workplace sexual harassment to be an important issue. For example, white male respondents were the least likely of all the groups to say that sexual harassment was a serious problem\u2014but it was still a clear majority at 63 percent. That\u2019s important not to lose sight of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the difference between women of color and the rest of these groups is considerable\u2014and may be explained by the double dose of discrimination that they\u2019re likely to face in the workplace.\n\nThe type of sexual harassment nonwhite women face can fold in layers of racial animus. In a recent New York Times piece, black women working at Ford plants reported being \u201cpropositioned and denounced as sluts while also being called \u2018black bitches\u2019 and other racial slurs.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this phenomenon crosses industries. In perhaps the most famous example to come out of Silicon Valley, Ellen Pao, one of the first to blow the whistle on tech\u2019s sexual harassment problems, described how her boss told her \u201che\u2019d specifically requested an Asian woman for my position. He liked the idea of a \u2018Tiger Mom\u2013raised\u2019 woman.\u201d Other Asian-American women have reported being stereotyped and demeaned in similar ways.\n\nBut why would white women be less likely than nonwhite men to consider sexual harassment a serious problem? We know from in-depth reporting across business and industries that white women certainly suffer the devastating effects of sexual abuse and misconduct, after all.\n\nThe Washington Post-ABC poll doesn\u2019t get into the why of the numbers. But Vlad Medenica, a postdoctoral scholar with GenForward Survey whose work centers on how identity shapes political and social attitudes, offered The Root some direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA potential explanation for some of this may be a history of, or different experiences with, marginalization and how that can then inform not just your perception of things, but your interpretation of different behaviors and actions,\u201d Medenica said. \u201cThat plays some role in explaining why some people think this isn\u2019t a problem and some people think this is a problem.\u201d\n\nTo put it another way, a marginalized racial identity may make you more sensitive to workplace sexual harassment than your gender identity\u2014even if women are more likely to suffer from sexual abuse in the workplace.\n\nAin\u2019t that something?", "keywords": ["harassment", "serious", "women", "real", "men", "survey", "likely", "white", "nonwhite", "say", "workplace", "problem", "groups", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.13452516233766232, "subjectivity": 0.5661106601731603},

In an effort to make some money before I left for grad school the following summer, and because nobody lives in my mother\u2019s house for free, I got a job. Using my fabulous brand-new biology degree, I became a security specialist at the headquarters of a credit union.\n\nI worked the day shift, 7-to-3, with another guy and our manager. It wasn\u2019t a uniformed position, and I mostly sat at the front desk checking in visitors and monitored alarms at our satellite locations.\n\nShortly after I started, my manager began making sexual comments in the office. Because of my circle of friends, the interests I had, I was used to hearing what the current president calls \u201clocker-room talk\u201d in my presence. Because of my age, I was often the youngest in the circle and, as a result, was everyone\u2019s little sister. I\u2019d also spent the past few years in college as a student athletic trainer, so I was familiar with how men talked to and about women. I was never the target of the conversation ... until then.\n\n\n\nMy manager often spoke about how I\u2019d never experienced things with a \u201creal\u201d man because I was used to dealing with boys. Through office conversation, he knew that I hadn\u2019t had a lot of boyfriends or been on many dates. I eventually felt guilty for participating in these conversations because it seemed like I was egging him on when I knew I wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nBut he was my boss, and I worried about what brushing him off would mean for me. Plus, this job wasn\u2019t long-term for me; I just needed to make it until summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, I learned not to be alone with him. I\u2019d offer to work the front desk when he was in the office and volunteer to escort the armed officers who made the money drops.\n\n\n\nOne day, I came to work in a dress. I could feel him leering at me when I walked in the office. I told my co-worker I was feeling generous and offered to sit at the front desk all day. But he was studying for an exam and needed to sit there so he could read in between guests.\n\nLater that day, our boss asked me to go grab supplies from the closet. When I walked in, he entered behind me. He told me I deserved to know what a real man could do. He pushed me down, pulled up my skirt, and placed his head between my legs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFear, shame and helplessness gripped my body. He commented on how he\u2019d been waiting for this. I closed my eyes, and after what seemed like an eternity, but was probably only a few minutes, he stopped and walked out of the room. Afraid he\u2019d come back, I left, too, and ran to the restroom.\n\nLater that afternoon, he walked up behind me and said he could still smell me on his mustache and he couldn\u2019t wait until I wore a dress again.\n\n\n\nI blamed myself. I thought of all the ways I could have prevented it from happening. Plus, I hadn\u2019t complained about the office conversations, so I must have somehow made him think it was OK. He was my manager, and I felt powerless. Who would believe me? So I did the only thing I thought I could do: From that day until I left, I wore pants to the office.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t consider what had happened to me to be assault. I didn\u2019t know there were avenues I could have pursued that could have helped me. I never considered that other women in the building might have similar experiences. I didn\u2019t realize that my manager was abusing his power.\n\nPower is the common thread in these stories. Power is the reason Matt Lauer went so long without women speaking out. Power is why Terry Crews\u2019 assailant is back at work as a high-profile talent agent. Power is why many other people are afraid to come forward.\n\n\n\nToday I\u2019m a human resources professional. My responsibilities include being an advocate for employees who may be harassed in the workplace. I take my job seriously because I know what it is like to feel helpless and powerless in these situations. With the rise of sexual harassment cases in the entertainment and media industry, it is easy to overlook what happens in regular office environments, the hospitality industry and, yes, even the security office.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you experience harassment in the workplace, it is imperative that you tell someone. Find a leader you trust, talk to your HR person; or, if you want to remain anonymous, most companies have a confidential line you can call.\n\nI know it is scary to speak out, but it is necessary to hold these people, and the companies that employ them, accountable.\n\n", "keywords": ["feeling", "harassment", "women", "powerless", "leaves", "work", "power", "workplace", "metoo", "left", "office", "day", "manager", "wasnt", "sexual", "know", "walked"], "polarity": -0.021081349206349208, "subjectivity": 0.45749961843711834},

The party\u2019s stubborn refusal to let go of white, working-class voters who voted for Donald Trump strengthens Biden\u2019s candidacy for some party elites who can\u2019t see that its future rests in the hands of women, young people and minorities\u2014not aging, conservative white men.\n\nBiden\u2019s instant name recognition would pose an immediate threat to other potential front-runners such as Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Terry McAuliffe and Bernie Sanders. But one sticking point that would have the potential to weaken Biden\u2019s candidacy is his unresolved history with Anita Hill. He was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when Hill brought forth allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas soon after his nomination for the Supreme Court.\n\nHill alleged that while she was working as Thomas\u2019 aide for several years in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Thomas routinely harassed her with sexual comments about his penis and watching porn. During the hearings, Hill repeated the claims to a very hostile committee of male senators who often grilled her more than they did Thomas.\n\nBiden was particularly criticized over the way he handled Hill\u2019s hourslong testimony. Members of the committee asked her intimate details about her sex life. One even suggested that she may have suffered from \u201cerotomania,\u201d a disorder that he suggested led Hill to believe Thomas was in love with her.\n\nBiden was criticized for not stopping these attacks. His refusal to call upon witnesses to support Hill\u2019s claims further angered women\u2019s groups and legal critics. Although he voted against Thomas\u2019 confirmation and has said recently that he always believed Hill, his shortcomings as chairman during those hearings are under an intense microscope again as women are going public with accusations of sexual assault by powerful men in Hollywood, business, media, politics and music. The recent change of climate is forcing everyone to be clear on their stance against workplace sexual harassment. Abusers are just beginning to suffer consequences in a very public manner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Biden publicly apologized Monday to Hill for how she was treated. That apology likely won\u2019t satisfy many of his critics. If Biden does run in 2020, he, like all Democratic candidates, will have to win over black women, the party\u2019s most important voters, during the primaries to earn the nomination. It\u2019s one thing to express sympathy for the emotional trauma Hill experienced. It is completely another to acknowledge the racial and gender hurdles Hill was forced to navigate during her testimony.\n\nTia Oso, an activist in Los Angeles, said that one of the most striking feelings that Hill\u2019s testimony evoked for her was that, by default, it appeared many of the senators refused to believe a black woman.\n\n\u201cWhite men are over-afforded credibility in our society, and by contrast, women of color\u2014especially black women\u2014always have the burden on us to prove what we\u2019re saying is true\u2014even when we\u2019re fighting for what\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would she have exactly gained by exposing Clarence Thomas for sexual harassment?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs history has shown, shame and international ridicule. Hill was not heralded as a hero then as she is today. A recent example of Oso\u2019s point came when Lupita Nyong\u2019o wrote in the New York Times that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her. While Weinstein generally remained mum about most of his white accusers, he responded directly to Nyong\u2019o\u2019s allegations, in a way that was particularly defensive, as if to say he could not possibly be attracted to a black woman.\n\nThe logic was clear: Who believes black women? Who would believe her?\n\nThat may explain why, for every black woman who reports sexual assault, 15 do not. The Journal of Family Violence also reports that black women suffer greater recovery problems after sexual assault than nonblack victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChardonnay Madkins, project manager for the advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, told the Los Angeles Times that, in part, black women are more reluctant than white women to report sexual assault because of patriarchal norms that center the societal struggles of black men over those of black women.\n\n\u201cIt tells these black women to remain silent because the education of their perpetrator is essentially more important than their education, and that [they] can\u2019t be another person who sends a black man to jail,\u201d Madkins told the Times. Women are told, \u201cThese are the few black men who were able to make it to college, and you trying to report them is going to hinder their success.\u201d\n\nThese were the very real pressures Hill faced back in 1991 when she testified against Thomas before the Senate Judiciary Committee, pressures neither Biden nor his colleagues likely considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Biden does run in 2020, he will have to articulate to black female voters how his insensitive handling of Hill\u2019s testimony impacted black women. Simply saying sorry for what Hill experienced isn\u2019t sufficient, and the issue likely will not quiet down.\n\nBiden needs to own it. And soon. How Biden will address his handling of Hill\u2019s testimony and when depends on a number of factors, says L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights, a national organization dedicated to helping black women win elected office. Conceivably, Williams added, if Biden opts to address his shortcomings during Hill\u2019s testimony now, he would not have to devote too much time to the issue in 2020.\n\n\u201cHe would have to describe the way in which [Hill\u2019s testimony] is perceived, and people know that Anita Hill was treated [badly] during those times, and address his regret for his part in it, while putting that up against his record of also advancing issues of sexual assault,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, Biden\u2019s legislative work advocating for the protection of women\u2014especially his landmark Violence Against Women Act\u2014is noteworthy. But one thing doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the other. Hill\u2019s testimony has paved the way for today\u2019s workplace harassment policies.\n\nThere is no telling how significant any of this will be several years from now, but Christina Greer, political scientist at Fordham University, warns that Biden cannot take any chances. The news cycle is primed to explore stories of sexual assault and the men who perpetrate it. Greer says that if media, especially black news sites, keep Hill\u2019s testimony in the news cycle, it will be very difficult for Biden to avoid.\n\n\u201cIf I were him, I\u2019d face it head on,\u201d she said. \u201cTake your lashes. Lick your wounds and rebuild with black women because he can\u2019t make it without us.\u201d", "keywords": ["anita", "apology", "women", "hills", "joe", "men", "hill", "testimony", "biden", "assault", "needs", "black", "better", "offer", "sexual", "thomas"], "polarity": 0.12769651723041564, "subjectivity": 0.4824309071342966},

When asked who she was rooting for at the night\u2019s Emmys, she made it very clear that she was rooting for everybody black (probably one of THE truest statements of all time\u2014also applies to the Olympics, elections and nonblack movies with black characters), setting off a viral round of \u201cYaaaassssssssss\u201d and T-shirts and catapulting her right into position as everybody\u2019s favorite black person for a solid at-least-two weeks. Basically, she was the opposite of Omarosa. The ONLY reason this isn\u2019t No. 1 is because, well, blackness seeks its own level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Shannon Sharpe pulls out a Black & Mild and talks about bein\u2019 off that \u201cyak\u201d (Hen Dawg in particular) on The Undisputed, Fox Sports 1\u2019s live sports talk show.\n\nListen, Linda. Listen. Sharpe said he likes to celebrate with cigars and yak and put a Black in his mouth ON TELEVISION. Even Joy Taylor knows that Black & Milds aren\u2019t real cigars. But that didn\u2019t stop Sharpe from going on about his love for Hen Dawg and Milds. That, my friends, is blackness seeking its own level. Those are the moments in blackness you don\u2019t see coming, which makes them special. Blackness is not here for you; it\u2019s here for the shenanigans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.

After writing about the season finale of Insecure last week, I wanted to move on to other topics for discussion. But then, at last night\u2019s Emmys, Rae, in a moment of candor, found a way to make all her fans proud to be a part of the #IssaHive. When asked who she was rooting for, she responded, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing shocking about this statement to anybody who has grown up black and rooted for damn near anything in their life. It is a mantra for any of us who have watched any competition in which one of the competitors looks like us, sounds like us or is familiar to us.\n\nI remember as a kid watching shows like Family Feud, Double Dare and even American Gladiators, competitions in which there were absolutely zero stakes for me, and if there was a black competitor, I was rooting for them. Back then, I never thought deeply about this sort of fan appreciation. My rationale was simple: Black contestants, even on shows like the ones I mentioned, were rare, and therefore, rooting for them was done more out of a feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it then, I probably wasn\u2019t going to get another chance.\n\n\n\nBut in hindsight, I realized that part of my thinking was programmed by the way I would learn about black history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe way black history is taught to us in school is through the guise of firsts. From a very early age, most of the black people we learn about are put under a lens of exceptionalism. We learn about a black person who overcame a system of oppression and racism to become the first black person to accomplish everything from being the first African-American world heavyweight champion (Jack Johnson) to sitting at the front of a bus (Rosa Parks), and even those stories are sometimes distorted (shoutout to Claudette Colvin), but I digress.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s this sort of conditioning that lends itself to our cheering for our own out of solidarity. As Scoop Jackson once said, anytime you hear about a first black person winning or accomplishing anything of note, it is a reminder that racism exists. Issa Rae\u2019s statement last night exemplified that.\n\n\n\nAlready there are people who took Rae\u2019s words as racist, but in fact, her comment was rooting against racism. When Issa said she was rooting for everybody black, she was rooting for a new history to be made. She was rooting for Lena Waithe (Master of None) to be the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing. She was rooting for Donald Glover (Atlanta) to be the first black person to win for comedy-series directing. She was rooting for Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us) to be the first black actor since 1998 to win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo for the same reasons I grew up rooting for Tiger Woods, Venus and Serena Williams, Barack Obama and any black contestant I saw on Jeopardy, Issa Rae was rooting for Donald Glover, Lena Waithe and Sterling K. Brown. There are so few of us in spaces like the Emmys that we rarely ever get the chance to root for us. So when we see us in those spaces, we may not know the full backstory, but we do know the history, and we\u2019re rooting for it to change.", "keywords": ["fubu", "everybody", "win", "rooting", "rae", "racism", "history", "black", "person", "learn", "raes", "im", "way", "issa"], "polarity": 0.09541889483065953, "subjectivity": 0.4461115355233002},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get, like, the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are\u2014all the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... you know I had a lot of work to do with getting past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie, because I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I kind of felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "hannah", "panther", "production", "beachler", "different", "told", "black", "designer", "studiosdisney", "marvel", "walks", "africa", "know", "important"], "polarity": 0.13435254680384556, "subjectivity": 0.5247883285545621},

That said, we realize that not all of you have, so gird your loins, because we\u2019re about to talk Dora Milaje. We\u2019ll try to avoid any spoilers.\n\nBAMorg via YouTube\n\nThe Dora Milaje\u2014Wakandan for \u201cadored ones\u201d\u2014first appeared in 1998, created by Christopher Priest during his tenure as writer of Black Panther. Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

It begins with acknowledgment that black people play a pivotal role in shaping various sectors of popular culture in the U.S. In its findings, \u201c73 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 67 percent of Hispanics believe that African Americans influence mainstream culture.\u201d Congratulations to all who can clock the obvious without complication.\n\n\n\nNow, as the report shifts to its specific focus, Nielsen notes, \u201cSeveral programs with a predominantly black cast or a main storyline focusing on a black character are drawing substantial non-black viewership.\u201d\n\nExamining 2016-2017 television, the study finds:\n\nWith 89 percent nonblack viewership, This Is Us, NBC\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated ensemble dramedy, includes Sterling K. Brown as a black businessman raised by white parents and tackles topics such as drug addiction, racism, homosexuality, alcoholism, adoption, obesity and cancer.\n\nABC\u2019s hit sitcom Black-ish follows a father and husband (Anthony Anderson) who\u2019s trying to create a sense of black cultural identity for his affluent family of four and has 79 percent nonblack viewership. Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays his wife, won the best actress in a comedy series Golden Globe for her role.\n\nThree-fourths of the viewers are nonblack for Secrets and Lies, the ABC crime drama that revolves around the biracial heir (Michael Ealy) to a Charlotte, N.C., equity firm and the murder of his wife.\n\nABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder is the Shonda Rhimes hit drama starring Academy Award winner Viola Davis as a criminal-defense professor who gets entangled in a murder plot. Sixty-nine percent of the show\u2019s viewership is nonblack.\n\nSixty-eight percent of viewership is nonblack for ABC\u2019s Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes \u201cShondaLand\u201d thriller featuring Kerry Washington as a media consultant to the president.\n\nWith 63 percent nonblack viewers, Fox\u2019s Pitch is a dramedy about the first woman, a black woman, to play baseball in the Major Leagues.\n\nInsecure is the HBO original comedy series co-created by Golden Globe-nominated Issa Rae. Inspired by Rae\u2019s popular web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, viewership is 61 percent nonblack.\n\nHalf of viewership for the newcomer Atlanta is nonblack. The show, a Golden Globe-winning comedy-drama on FX created by and starring Donald Glover, centers on two black cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the tone of this study, one is supposed to find this encouraging.\n\n\n\nIndeed, of its findings, Andrew McCaskill, senior vice president, communications and multicultural marketing at Nielsen, says:\n\n\n\nMuch of the American narrative lately has focused on a growing cultural divide. But Nielsen\u2019s data on television programming show something different. Storylines with a strong black character or identity are crossing cultural boundaries to grab diverse audiences and start conversations. That insight is important for culture and content creators, as well as manufacturers and retailers looking to create engaging, high-impact advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRespectfully, presenting data that reveals that black-led television shows have crossover appeal is akin to other earth-shattering news like Popeyes biscuits taste like heaven in your mouth, there\u2019s nothing like being debt-free and dick too bomb.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely revealing about this information. The same goes for the study\u2019s noting that shows with a majority-black audience, like Empire, can manage to still \u201cpropel a show to Emmy-nominated, award-winning mainstream success.\u201d\n\nYes, Taraji P. Henson is a Golden Globe-winning, Emmy-nominated actress thanks to her role as Cookie Lyon on Empire, but you know who long ago met this feat? Jack\u00e9e Harry, who remains the first and only black woman to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She won for her role as the original Instagram model Sandra Clark on 227. 227 was a show about working-class Negroes in Washington, D.C., before the white folks took over and put bike lanes on Georgia Avenue near Howard University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo am I supposed to be thrilled about this news that could easily have been packaged with the hashtags of #TBT or #FBF? Sorry, Nielsen, but I do decline. To be fair, Nielsen does note that television shows such as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son and The Cosby Show had already proved that our shows can be watched by all. Even so, Nielsen offers the addendum: \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual now is the sheer number of such programs that are carrying cross-cultural appeal.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t much \u2019bout al-ge-bra, but I do know if a few black shows can claim crossover appeal, an increased volume ought to yield a similar result. Us black folks are pretty diverse, don\u2019t ya know? I mean, clearly America had Negro fatigue, as evidenced by that new man in the White House, but if The Cosby Show and A Different World could thrive as trifling Ronald Reagan hollered about welfare queens and crack, Issa Rae, Donald Glover, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis can maintain success under Minute Maid Mao\u2019s mismanaged terrorist reign.\n\nSo, now that we know that the truth of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s is true in the 2010s, what will networks do about it? Will they continue to be more inclusive in their background? They could. After all, it would be nice to see more visibility in terms of class, gender and sexual orientation. We may be seeing more of us on television, but it\u2019s still not all of us. Maybe networks will finally embrace a stubborn reality and keep a great thing going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr they could follow their previous pattern of seeing our value and casting it aside anyway. In some respects, you already see that. Go ask Tamron Hall. Go ask anyone black who tried to launch a successful television show in the late 1990s or 2000s.\n\n\n\nI want to be hopeful because hope is all we have. However, while others celebrated this survey, I found it largely inconsequential. Those majority-white executives have always known that black people and black culture can reach all. It is a debate that has long been settled.\n\n\n\nAgain, the question is not can we be appreciated by all, but when will our value finally be acknowledged, accepted and, mostly, continuously invested in? Then we can ask about a proper Girlfriends series finale or full-out reunion because Joan and Toni not reuniting before the conclusion was some bullshit. Consider that a part of the reparations backstage, white people.\n\n", "keywords": ["treatment", "appeal", "nielsen", "television", "viewership", "sidepiece", "golden", "white", "series", "black", "shows", "crossover", "tv", "nonblack", "know", "blackled"], "polarity": 0.1290927822177822, "subjectivity": 0.48281041874791863},

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["jeweler", "women", "panther", "work", "douriean", "jewelry", "adorned", "feel", "armored", "black", "designer", "think", "create", "heavy", "metal"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

In fact, I\u2019ve spent more time being confounded by their inability to disappear into the hip-hop ether than I have enjoying their trapcoctions. Also, the fact that these are some \u201ctrappers\u201d from Gwinnett County \u2013 aka \"the North, that way\" aka where you move to in Atlanta when you\u2019ve made it and need to stay away from family \u2013 always rubbed me the wrong way. I realize that being \u201creal\u201d in rap is a long overrated requirement, however, sometimes knowing too much can ruin a thing.\n\nThough MC Breed was wrong when he proclaimed that there was no future in frontin, I can openly admit to enjoying several songs created by not one migo, but all three of the Migos. Moving on, because of them, in 2013, I said the word \u201cVersace\u201d at least 2,000 more times than I otherwise would have. The hook to \u201cFight Night\u201d is WAAAAAAY more fun to recite in any venue than you\u2019d believe. And while I\u2019m not both \u201cHandsome AND Wealthy\u201d, one out of two ain\u2019t bad. I guess the Migos ain\u2019t so bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings us to the Golden Globes from a few weeks back, when Donald Glover, in his infinite wisdom, made this statement while receiving one of his two awards:\n\n\u201cI really wanna thank the Migos, not for being in the show, but for making \u2018Bad and Boujee,\u2019\u201d Glover said. \u201cLike that\u2019s the best song ever.\u201d\n\nWhich was hilarious for a few reasons: 1) this statement likely helped drive \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d to the number one spot on Billboard the next week, and 2) they panned to Stevie Wonder in the audience who looked confused as if to say, \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhem.\n\nThing is, I might agree with Donald Glover. Hyperbole? Yes. But listen, that song is infectious. Here are 10 reasons why Donald Glover just might be right.\n\n1. I came to know \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d the same way MOST of us did: I kept hearing mothefuckers referencing rain drops and drop tops and had NO clue what the hell they were talking about. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and made me do the googles was some meme about what some fellow was leaving in 2016 and taking into 2017, and he was bringing \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d. Once I googled and saw it referenced a Migos song, my first inclination was to be like, \u201coh that makes sense, what\u2019s on NPR?\u201d but I listenededededed to the song for what was the first of maybe a solid, I don\u2019t know, 1,000, over the past few weeks. No lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoint is, \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d is the gateway to that song and whether they knew it or not, it\u2019s motherfucking brilliant because it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SONG AND MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER but holy shit. You\u2019ve heard no shortage of people you know and respect say \u201crain drops, drop tops\u201d in the past few weeks sending you to the breaking point where you have to google it and then life.changes. I may or may not have said this in a meeting at work recently. My boss may or may not have said, \u201cI keep hearing this, what is that?\u201d Only one of the preceding sentences is false.\n\n2. The beat isn\u2019t anywhere close to being one of Metro Boomin\u2019s best beats. However, something about that slow, plodding beat is sympatico with asses clapping on stripper poles, rolling down the street smokin' indo sippin' on gin and juice , sweeping, mixing up cake batter, stapling, doing a chemistry experiment, etc. It's multi-purpose. If you walked into your progressive church and heard the beat playing as the ushers sat you down, would you be surprised? Probably not.\n\n3. Much like Waka Flocka Flame's \"Round of Applause,\" \"Bad and Boujee\" is fully appreciable by watching an ENTIRE room full of educated professionals say, \u201cmy bitch is bad and boujee, cookin\u2019 up dope with an uzi\u2026\u201d, most of whom have never seen an uzi in their entire lives and don\u2019t even realize that the very gun STOPPED BEING MANUFACTURED ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Let\u2019s talk about uzis since the Migos talk about uzis, a lot. While I\u2019d like to think that is just drug dealers talking about their hardware, I\u2019d put all of my money on the fact that because \u201cuzi\u201d rhymes with \u201cboujee\u201d it\u2019s the firearm of choice for our friendly neighborhood Subway-restaurant trappers from Lawrenceville, at least on this song. However, again, brilliant. It\u2019s got me talking about uzis again and that\u2019s almost always a good thing.\n\n5. Offset bodies both the hook and his verse. And until this song, I absolutely could not tell Offset from Takeoff, two niggas with some of the most non-awesome rap names in a long time, which is saying something because I just mentioned Waka Flocka Flame. Like, you cannot see yourself buying an album from a nigga named Offset. Or Takeoff for that matter. Quavo has the best name and is the clear standout of Migos, except on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d where, again, Offset goes for broke and puts his foot all up in this song.\n\n6. \u201cYeah, that way\u201d has been on my soul for the past three weeks. I say this whenever I can. Seriously. I stood outside Metro one day asking pedestrians if they needed directions JUST so I could say, \u201cYEAH, THAT WAY.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. I\u2019m about to get real meta for a second. There are three members of Migos: Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff. In some odd Black family way, they\u2019re all actual family, like cousins and uncles and nephews or some shit. It\u2019s Black as fuck. However, on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d, only Offset and Quavo are present along with a HORRID verse from Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert (we\u2019ll get to him later). In my head, there was a decision that had to be made where they were determining who wouldn\u2019t make the cut for \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d and they decided to take off\u2026TAKEOFF.\n\nBruh.\n\nThey taked off TAKEOFF off the song. Mind.Blown. I almost wonder if they were sitting around and had a moment of divine inspiration at the realization and Takeoff just stood up and walked out the studio. It\u2019s almost poetic. The lesson here: don\u2019t name yourself Takeoff unless you\u2019re a plane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Lil\u2019 Uzi Vert is on this song. He sucks. Tremendously. According to the social medias, he is apparently the hot nigga on the song. I contest that stress. I don\u2019t even hate the Tiny Green Gunna Boy. His song \u201cMoney Longer\u201d is a straight banger. I think he looks odd and even in this video he some how decides to tuck his t-shirt into some extra small sweatpants, which is decidedly unhip-hop. But even though his verse is the worst on the song \u2013 he doesn\u2019t say \u201cthat way\u201d not even once, the lazy tiny bastard \u2013 because the song itself is so awesome, I can live with it. He\u2019s just lucky his name isn\u2019t some shit like TakeOff. But on some EXTRA meta shit, Migos were like, we took off Takeoff, and Offset was dancing around singing about uzis and I\u2019ll bet Quavo said\u2026 \u201cbruh, there\u2019s a rapper named Uzi\u2026let\u2019s get him.\u201d\n\nMind. More blown.\n\n9. Quavo says the word \u201cratatouille\u201d like rat-a-tooly. Let that sink in. He says to call him Quavo Rat-a-tooly. That happened. You and I both know he\u2019s seen the movie Ratatouille because who hasn\u2019t. Yet and still he added in the \u201cl\u201d in what can only be described as an eff you to the French. And it was awesome. I\u2019m here for France, tho. Because lineage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The term \u201cbad and boujee\u201d itself is alliterative perfection. Offset says is in the most serendipitous way possible. They should get a Grammy for best sound recording in 2017. They won\u2019t. But they should. It works. It\u2019s employed. The Migos told me to tell you, \u201cyou\u2019re welcome.\u201d And no, serendipity didn't work up there. But neither does \"rain drops, drop tops\" and they have the number one song in the country.

He\u2019s not just creating music for the music\u2019s sake, he\u2019s using the circumstances to make his musical career into a spectacle of its own. He controls the narrative.\n\n\n\nGlover got his artist alias, Childish Gambino, from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. In the same vein, his formative years as an emcee were equally whimsical. Glover didn\u2019t have the obscurity that he should have had during his early emceeing years as he was working to become a competent emcee.\n\nHis initial projects were given more attention than they deserved due to his involvement in Derrick Comedy and his work as a writer for 30 Rock. He later described his 2005 project, The Younger I Get, as the musings of a \u201cdecrepit Drake.\u201d The four projects that followed\u2014Sick Boi, Poindexter, I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2\u2014were released between 2008 and 2010.\n\nHighlights of this era of Childish Gambino include a nasally tone, awkward rhyme schemes, poor mixing and mediocre production. Let\u2019s be clear. These projects have not aged well. They appealed to a number of people who could appreciate his potential, his passion and his vision. He won people over with his earnest hunger and passion, despite his amateurish level of skill. We\u2019ll call this his \u201clet\u2019s build\u201d phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlover\u2019s next project, Culdesac, was the beginning of a much more calculated era in his career. It released in July 2010, only about five months after the release of I Am Not a Rapper 2. Despite the short turnaround time between projects, Culdesac was a major turning point for Gambino. He did not achieve mastery, but he came into his own as both a producer and an emcee. It\u2019s no coincidence that the two happened in tandem.\n\nThe 16-track project, which was entirely self-produced, was a definitive step up from previous releases due to the synergy between his mellow, singsong delivery style and his pop-friendly brand of production. Tracks like the Adele-sampling \u201cDo Ya Like\u201d hit a sweet spot. With this project, he was able to establish himself as a legitimate artist with household potential.\n\nHis March 2011 release, a five-track project called EP, gave us \u201cFreaks And Geeks,\u201d his most technically proficient outing as an emcee, and his most dramatic single up to that point. Gambino was growing by leaps and bounds as an emcee, and he knew it. His narrative of a vulnerable suburban black nerd was replaced by a man who knew he had the juice, thanks to lines such as \u201cNigga can\u2019t you tell, that my sample of Adele, was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowing up my cell?\u201d Clearly, that sample on \u201cDo Ya Like\u201d from Culdesac was doing numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2011, Gambino came back at us with his debut album, Camp. The 13-track project was co-produced in its entirety by his longtime collaborator, Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that this was his most musically complex affair. He pieced together more elements than ever before, often haphazardly, and dove into some of the most personal narratives of his career to keep us intrigued in the midst of the chaos.\n\nThis project gave us conflicting emotions, and a complex soundscape to match. He adopted the narrative of being a black, nerdy misfit with this project before transitioning back to pushing for street credit with his next project, Royalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember how excited Gambino was to rap about \u201chood niggas\u201d blowing up his cell on the EP standout \u201cFreaks And Geeks\u201d? He wasn\u2019t joking. Cue Royalty, with guest features from the likes of Nipsey Hussle, ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Bun B and Danny Brown. This is the project where Gambino made a noted push to be more accepted by mainstream hip-hop culture. Not only did he have a lot of big-name features, but he switched up his flow and subject matter to match the occasion. Vulnerabilities and insecurities were pushed to the side on songs with big-name features, as he embraced his more braggadocious side.\n\nThe fact that Gambino contended with verses from an aggressive, hungry ScHoolboy Q and a laser-sharp Ab-Soul on \u201cUnnecessary\u201d and didn\u2019t get annihilated in the process is worth talking about.\n\nTwo years earlier, Donald Glover was proud to be stringing multiple punchlines together in one verse. Had he attempted this two years earlier, it would have been ugly. At this point in the game, he had the tools in his arsenal to rise to the occasion, and he did, gaining the approval of a number of more \u201chip-hop purist\u201d-oriented fans in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSatisfied with the acclaim swirling around Royalty, Glover moved into a different phase of his career once more, with a different goal in mind. In the same year that he left Community, he released his second studio album, a very mysterious album called Because the Internet.\n\nKeep in mind that Glover was known primarily as a comedian during the formative years of his career as a musician. After the release of Royalty, he had gained a significant amount of respect for his talent as a musician.\n\nBecause the Internet took on a much more experimental, psychedelic feel. Instrumentation was less bright and more nuanced. Subject matter was pushed into more universal territory. While we could feel the ever-present chip on Gambino\u2019s shoulder with previous projects, Because the Internet centered around artistry and pushed hubris to the side. Painting a picture became the focus. Donald Glover wanted to be taken more seriously as an artist, and critics largely did just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2014, Gambino came back with a double release, STN MTN/Kauai. It\u2019s important to note that STN MTN was released as a mixtape, while Kauai was released as en EP. While Kauai served as a more polished, introspective dose of his pop-friendly, R&B alter ego, STN MTN was where he set out to make a statement.\n\nThe first words on STN MTN? \u201cI had a dream I ran Atlanta, and I was on every radio station.\u201d While the project title clearly shouts out his hometown of Stone Mountain, the project is so Atlanta it\u2019s not even funny.\n\nGambino teams up with local mainstay Kari Faux for \u201cSmall Talk,\u201d references Atlanta strip club Follies during interludes, and raps over a host of instrumentals made iconic by Atlanta artists. While it was more beneficial to focus on the Stone Mountain narrative in earlier, more vulnerable projects like Camp, the more cocky, braggadocious Gambino puts on for Atlanta with confidence this time around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe sings a beautiful falsetto cover of Usher\u2019s \u201cU Don\u2019t Have to Call\u201d on the project, and includes an insightful, entertaining narrative at the end. He mentions, \u201cI was never a thug, and they used to respect me for it. But now the game is fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas.\u201d\n\nMichael Corleone is the main protagonist of The Godfather, and he has one key thing in common with Glover; the determination to accomplish his goals by any means, even if it means losing everything in the process and rebuilding from scratch.\n\nIn what might be his most drastic transformation to date, Gambino released Awaken, My Love! on Dec. 2, 2016. In the same way that Michael Corleone destroyed everything that stood in his way in The Godfather, Glover destroyed almost every preconception of his artistry with this project, diving deep into influences such as Bootsy Collins, Parliament and Prince to deliver a spacey, soulful ode to different eras of black artistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe progression he\u2019s taken as an artist is one of a man equally committed to risk-taking and perfection. Most importantly, he\u2019s dedicated to being an artist whose shifts, whims and phases continue to force us to reconsider his limitations. He chooses to hone in on specific elements such as his emceeing, production, singing and composition, adopting different personas to fit the nature of the chapter of his story that he\u2019s penning in the moment.\n\nWhen he feels that he\u2019s mastered a particular element of his artistry, he soars with it and embraces the full vision he has for it, as seen in the braggadocious lyricism of Royalty, the bold experimentalism of Because the Internet, the sharp contrast of STN MTN/Kauai, and the transcendental funk of Awaken, My Love!.\n\nWhen he\u2019s still putting the pieces together, he falls back on the familiarity of his vulnerable, relatable childhood narrative as a black kid who didn\u2019t quite fit in to make himself more relatable. Culdesac and Camp, arguably his two least confidently executed projects, are prime examples of this, as they center around introspection. Glover is one of the most adept musical chameleons in that oftentimes, we don\u2019t even recognize that he\u2019s donned a disguise to shift the way that we receive him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Glover a manipulative mastermind with some sort of dark, underlying motive? Most likely not. Is he a very emotionally intelligent, masterful communicator with a knack for using the reality of his situation and the limitations of his talents to his benefit? Absolutely.\n\nJust remember that in addition to his musical exploits, he will always be an actor, a comedian and a storyteller. His musical career is an integral element of his story as a man and as a creative, and he will always be in complete control of the plot, pulling strings from behind the scenes and watching the audience react from the rafters.", "keywords": ["donald", "chameleon", "projects", "artist", "glover", "narrative", "adept", "hes", "stn", "project", "career", "released", "hiphops", "gambino"], "polarity": 0.12009195893926436, "subjectivity": 0.4956658112346737},

For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get, like, the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are\u2014all the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... you know I had a lot of work to do with getting past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie, because I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I kind of felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "hannah", "panther", "production", "beachler", "different", "told", "black", "designer", "studiosdisney", "marvel", "walks", "africa", "know", "important"], "polarity": 0.13435254680384556, "subjectivity": 0.5247883285545621},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["teamsupernatural", "panther", "friend", "movie", "hero", "camille", "hair", "panthers", "meet", "designer", "black", "think", "having", "traditional", "natural", "really"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Listen, when Living Single debuted in August of \u201993, I knew immediately that I wanted to be Khadijah James (played by Queen Latifah). She had my dream job (editor of a hip-hop magazine), lived in my dream city (New York City) and dressed exactly how I wanted to dress.\n\nKhadijah was just the right amount of butch, with a cool, relaxed streetwear feel. I longed for the many African-American College Alliance sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts and hats that filled her closet.

But late-\u201980s new jack swing caught my attention, as artists started sampling, remaking and covering my beloved old-school soul and R&B artists. In 1992, when Dr. Dre dropped The Chronic, I recognized the rhythms from my childhood escapes into my pop\u2019s record collection.\n\nG-funk lifted the beauty of the bass, synth and live instrumental tracks of Parliament-Funkadelic to combine it with deep 808s. I would often point out to my friends that I\u2019d already introduced them to the music they were bumping out of their speakers; and as the lyricism got tighter and R&B increased its flirtation with hip-hop, I found myself falling for not only the music but also the fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u201990s, I was too broke to afford the clothes I wanted to wear. I was often underemployed and occasionally more worried about housing than clothing; but flipping through the Source magazine, I\u2019d envision myself rocking Timberlands and Tommy Hilfiger with baggy jeans.

Feinberg\u2019s novel felt like a revelation to me and finally gave me an identity to aspire to: butch.\n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t have much of an idea what \u201cbutch\u201d meant except through the lens of that book, so I began to fashion\u2014at least in my mind\u2014what that meant for me. When I saw Set It Off, I fell completely in love with the image of another iconic Latifah character, Cleo. I, too, wanted to be stone butch with a badass, blond-\u2019fro-rocking black femme by my side.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Love Jones rolled around in 1997, I was hanging out in chat rooms and connecting with a world of black lesbians. I\u2019d firmly established myself as a stud, and aspired to be a spoken-word artist. I devoured that movie, believing that it painted an accurate picture of black, middle-class life in Chicago\u2014my new dream city.\n\n\n\nI loved Love Jones and its romance with culture and music and poetry. The leather jackets and boots felt reminiscent of the \u201970s, while the blue tones of the cinematography felt simultaneously familiar and fresh, like a new jack Gordon Parks photo album. I imagined myself being as cool as the film\u2019s hero, Darius, and while Nia Long\u2019s Nina was beautiful, I wanted to fall in love with Lisa Nicole Carson.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of these pop-cultural touchstones exposed me to a range of black aesthetics. The beauty of \u201990s fashion was its fluidity, the way it brought together the masculine and the feminine. In many ways, women were able to play with gender norms and identity by poaching clothes from their boyfriends, male cousins, brothers or friends, adding feminine touches like bamboo earrings or large hoops (I\u2019ve always been a hoop boi).\n\nI spent the \u201990s in search of what being butch/stud/masculine of center meant to me. My own emerging style was heavily influenced not only by seeing us on-screen but by up-and-coming black-owned brands like FUBU, Sean John and Phat Farm\u2014brands that highlighted the reality that hip-hop had long moved out of New York City\u2019s South Bronx and was on its way to becoming a global commodity.\n\nBut I often wonder when the shift happened in women\u2019s clothing. Back in the \u201990s, it felt like there was a range of female expression\u2014from Lil\u2019 Kim and Foxy Brown to Queen Latifah and Lauryn Hill. The women of Bad Boy famously cultivated a femme-aggressive look, mixing hard and soft together. When did women stop being able to rock a hoodie and baggy jeans and still be considered sexy? When did fashion for women become more about how much skin we\u2019re showing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it\u2019s always been that way, and I\u2019d just rather remember it differently.\n\nWhile there are definitely some fashions we should leave in the \u201990s (backward clothing, Cross Colours, shiny leather suits\u2014or really any leather suits\u2014and patchwork jeans), the \u201990s were a decade of revolutionary style. Aside from helping a young stud find her way, it was an era that helped a generation of Xers make a mark on a world eager to ignore them\u2014with swag to spare.", "keywords": ["id", "shaped", "women", "love", "wanted", "single", "felt", "living", "style", "jones", "hiphop", "butch", "90s", "way", "latifah"], "polarity": 0.17467765209700697, "subjectivity": 0.47019852906949694},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get, like, the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are\u2014all the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... you know I had a lot of work to do with getting past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie, because I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I kind of felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "hannah", "panther", "production", "beachler", "different", "told", "black", "designer", "studiosdisney", "marvel", "walks", "africa", "know", "important"], "polarity": 0.13435254680384556, "subjectivity": 0.5247883285545621},

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get, like, the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are\u2014all the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... you know I had a lot of work to do with getting past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie, because I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I kind of felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "hannah", "panther", "production", "beachler", "different", "told", "black", "designer", "studiosdisney", "marvel", "walks", "africa", "know", "important"], "polarity": 0.13435254680384556, "subjectivity": 0.5247883285545621},

The New York Times reports that Walker also helped to supervise South Africa\u2019s first fully representative elections in 1994, after the apartheid regime fell there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker helped circulate one of King\u2019s most deeply felt and inspiring works, \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important blueprints of the civil rights movement, and helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, which culminated with King\u2019s historic \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nKing was said to have described Walker as \u201cone of the keenest minds of the nonviolent revolution.\u201d\n\nIt seemed as if Walker was destined to fight the good fight no matter who it was against. At one point, the Times reports, infamous drug kingpin Frank Lucas put a hit on him, but Walker said that because he had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, he \u201cwas accustomed to dangerous situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWyatt Tee Walker was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children, and a grandson of slaves. He received an education at the HBCU Virginia Union University, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree with honors, in both physics and chemistry, at age 19. He pledged the Gamma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and met King (also an Alpha) while in college. He also obtained his Bachelor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union\u2019s Graduate School of Religion. In 1950 he married Theresa Edwards, with whom he eventually had four children: Wyatt Jr., Robert, Earl and Ann.\n\nWalker began his civil rights work in Virginia and served as president for five years of the Petersburg branch of the NAACP and as state director of the Congress of Racial Equality, which he co-founded in 1958.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe joined the SCLC in 1961\u2014personally recruited by King\u2014and eventually moved to Atlanta to serve as its first full-time executive director. In 1965 Walker moved to Harlem, where he initially was a minister at the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church. Two years later, he became the pastor and chief executive of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, a post he held until 2004.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Walker served as urban affairs specialist to New York Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, helping advise on racial relations and integration. In 1975 he completed his doctorate at Colgate Rochester Divinity School.\n\n\n\nOf his myriad civil rights works, the Times reports that as pastor of Canaan, Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly, and what the church calls the oldest senior-services center in Harlem. He also established Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank. After retiring from Canaan after suffering a series of strokes, he moved to Virginia in 2004, where he remained until his death.\n\nHarlem\u2019s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture collected his papers from the period 1963-1982.

Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday.

(Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "women", "panther", "live", "movie", "watching", "thing", "love", "film", "forever", "night", "black", "opening", "went"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

As she told Newsweek in 2017:\n\nWhat I do now, when I\u2019m taking on a film, I always ask about the fairness of the pay. I ask what they\u2019re offering me in comparison to the guy. I don\u2019t care about how much I get paid; I\u2019m in an industry where we\u2019re overcompensated for the work we do. But I don\u2019t want to be on a set where I\u2019m doing the same work as someone else and they\u2019re getting five times what I\u2019m getting.\n\nSo when Chastain approached Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer about doing a holiday comedy with her (the two first appeared together in 2011\u2019s The Help), the discussion naturally turned to the gender wage gap. But what Chastain wasn\u2019t prepared for was the wage gap she\u2019d yet to consider: how much less actresses of color make than their white counterparts.\n\nGood friend Spencer quickly brought her up to speed\u2014a conversation she recounted last week while on the Women Breaking Barriers panel at the Sundance Film Festival (Spencer\u2019s revelation begins at the 19:30 mark):\n\nWomen Breaking Barriers panel at Sundance 2018 (Golden Globes/YouTube screenshot)\n\nWe were dropping f-bombs and getting it all out there. And then I said, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: Women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women. So if we\u2019re gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.\u201d And I told her my story, and we talked numbers, and she was quiet, and she said she had no idea that that\u2019s what it was like for women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChastain did more than listen; she committed to bringing her new knowledge to the negotiating table, brokering what she called a \u201cfavored nations\u201d deal. As Spencer recalls:\n\nShe said: \u201cOctavia, we\u2019re gonna get you paid on this film. You and I are gonna be tied together. We\u2019re gonna be favored nations, and we\u2019re gonna make the same thing.\u201d\n\nChastain\u2019s negotiations sparked a bidding war for the film, which will be produced by Chastain and released by Universal Pictures, and resulted in salaries five times higher than what was initially offered, making Spencer\u2019s salary as an actor equal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Chastain told Business Insider in 2016:\n\nWe really need to look at ourselves and say we need to reevaluate this. We need to reevaluate women who ask for a pay raise or ask for a promotion. It\u2019s actually an okay thing. It\u2019s okay to be ambitious, it\u2019s okay to be over-prepared.\n\nIt may be the type of story that for some will evoke tropes of the \u201cwhite savior,\u201d or the much overused (and often misunderstood) term \u201cwhite allies.\u201d But for Spencer, it\u2019s simply an example of how true allies can effectively use their privilege for positive change: \u201cI love that woman, because she\u2019s walking the walk and she\u2019s actually talking the talk.\u201d", "keywords": ["women", "gonna", "film", "white", "ask", "told", "pay", "earn", "im", "octavia", "worth", "chastain", "helped", "jessica", "spencer", "privilege"], "polarity": 0.2190909090909091, "subjectivity": 0.3655952380952381},

So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["eye", "js", "color", "bliges", "opal", "love", "mary", "limit", "look", "sag", "great", "looks", "michael", "black", "price", "awards"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

The police were called to the scene after being \u201calerted to an actor with a gun.\u201d But Anita Williams, Mark Daniels\u2019 aunt, claimed that her nephew did not own or carry a gun. She also claimed that while Daniels was in the hospital, his body was guarded by \u201cfour or five\u201d police officers and his family wasn\u2019t allowed to see him.\n\nThe case is currently being investigated, as is the case with all fatal police-involved shootings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this from the Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pittsburgh police officer who fatally shot a man during an exchange of gunfire in Homewood on Feb. 11 has been involved in two other shootings in the past 10 months. Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday. It\u2019s at least the third time in recent months Officer Macioce has opened fire while on the job in Zone 5. He was involved in non-fatal shootings in January and April, court records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2017, Macioce shot 20-year-old Christopher Howard, who robbed two women in the area, was approached and chased by Macioce and allegedly pulled out a sawed-off shotgun. Macioce shot Howard, forcing him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in January 2018, Macioce was involved in the shooting of 26-year-old Eric Farrar, who allegedly was carrying a shotgun, dropped it when the officers ordered him to and then reached into his waistband for a pistol to fire at them. Macioce and a second officer on the scene shot and critically wounded him.\n\nNow, is it possible that each of these shootings was justified and that Macioce just happened to be the officer on the scene each time? Yes, that is possible. Is it also possible that Macioce happened to have three criminals separately attempt to shoot him in less than a year\u2019s time? Yes, that is possible. Considering that many officers can go entire 30-year careers without anyone shooting at them, is it possible that Macioce is just unfathomably unlucky? Yes, that is possible.\n\nRegardless of the possibilities, it\u2019s definitely true that violence keeps finding Gino Macioce. Or perhaps violence doesn\u2019t have to look that hard because Macioce keeps looking for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since it\u2019s true that each man Macioce shot was black, it\u2019s also possible that Gino Macioce just keeps finding reasons to shoot black people.", "keywords": ["possible", "officer", "shootings", "shot", "macioce", "kills", "officers", "black", "yes", "daniels", "scene", "pittsburgh", "cop", "shoots"], "polarity": 0.004166666666666665, "subjectivity": 0.53671875},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["wakanda", "wannabes", "panther", "felt", "ruth", "cultural", "feel", "carter", "black", "film", "theyre", "marveldisney", "know", "consciousness", "costumes"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B.

It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get, like, the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ...

We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad.

That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... you know I had a lot of work to do with getting past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie, because I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all.

Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I kind of felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ...

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed his way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along.

A statement from Thompkins' ex-wife, Brenda Richmond, who was in the house with him and said she blames the burglar, not the police, for Thompkins' death.\n\n2. Information about Thompkins' criminal history from both the Post-Gazette piece linked above and stories such as this one published by KDKA,\n\nI am ashamed to admit that the information about Thompkins' history served the intended purpose of including it. Although it has absolutely no relevance in this context, I allowed it to color my perception of him and the circumstances that led to his death. This is an editorial ploy that I'm acutely aware of \u2014 I've both written and spoken about it extensively \u2014 and I still fell for it. And I'm writing about this today (finally) because it needs to be written about and because I don't want any of you to succumb to that trap.\n\nPlus, the need to \"get more facts\" was a misguided one, because there are already enough facts here. It's a fact that Christopher Thompkins was shot and killed in his own home by the police.

Or perhaps even two minutes away in the Bakery Square condominiums and lofts. I strongly doubt that the officers would have been as quick to pull their triggers in those neighborhoods. And, if they still decided to fire, I have no doubt they would have waited a split second longer to make certain they were aiming at the right guy.\n\nAmerica has always been and will continue to be a uniquely dangerous place for Black people.

The hardest part was creating an entire country, more technologically advanced than anywhere on the planet, based around an indestructible super-metal that doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. The process started with a single question.\n\n\u201cOne of the questions [Coogler] was trying to ask and answer is what it means to be African in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d co-writer Joe Robert Cole told io9. \u201cWhich I think, in the back of your mind with this property, is always there.\u201d\n\nCole was one of the first people hired to make Black Panther, before even Coogler himself. He pitched a story to Marvel and had a treatment, but was sort of in a holding pattern until a director came on board.\n\n\u201cI knew I was not going to write the movie before there was a director on it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI believe when they got into negotiating, [Coogler] saw [my treatment]. But then he had his own themes and ideas and vision for the movie. It was my job, at that point, to help him bring the movie he wanted to make [to life].\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce Coogler came on board and started writing with Cole, he brought in his own creative team as well. One of the key hires was production designer Hannah Beachler, who was tasked with figuring out what Wakanda looks like in the MCU. For her, the first question was simple but crucial: Where is Wakanda in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven answering that question was a big question because [in Iron Man 2] there\u2019s a picture where of Wakanda on the map,\u201d Beachler told io9. \u201cAnd I said to Ryan, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And we asked [Marvel Studios president] Kevin Feige, \u2018Is it there?\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, guys, where do you want it?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey decided on a a location on the Eastern part of the continent, below the Sahara desert. Once that was set, Beachler began researching cultures and tribes in that area, but that was just the first of many, many inspirations. She also looked at all eras of Black Panther comics, from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in the \u201860s, to the Panther\u2019s Rage storyline of the \u201870s, all the way to the first storyline from the current run by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreez. And while she blended elements from all of them, the original comics were particular helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really wanted to spend time with the Jack Kirby designs because I wanted to understand that time period. What was going on in the world? What would he have known about Africa?\u201d Beachler said. She was fascinated thinking about how, at that time, those creators didn\u2019t have easy access to visual aids showing what Africa really looked like. What she found was they primarily used inspirations from the Timbuktu area of Mali, so those designs, coupled with superhero archetypes, were another source for her to draw from. \u201cIn that sense I am reaching back to the canon of it,\u201d Beachler said.\n\nCole, too, talked about going back to the canon of Black Panther when writing the script with Coogler. \u201cYou read all the comics. You look at the canon and you kind of extrapolate out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat themes do you want to play with? What stories make sense? What\u2019s happening in the world? How do you bridge America with Africa? You just try to investigate ways to do that in character, in personal ways, so that they can resonate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComics and geography are only two of the elements that went into creating the country. Obviously, this Wakanda isn\u2019t in the \u201860s, it\u2019s now\u2014and since it\u2019s so technologically advanced beyond the rest of the modern world, Beachler\u2019s research also extended into future technology.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot about figuring out how many years in advance they were. A hundred years? Two hundred years? And in the end, we kind of settled on a number and then we started looking at tech that was coming,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cTED Talks and things like that. I talked to a lot of architects who were doing futuristic cities, who are designing Google cities, and anthropological architects, geologists. I did a lot of research on Elon Musk and his work with the Hyperloop. So all of that. Then you reach back into tradition, and I thought to myself \u2018How is it that this one specific thing evolved over time and became useful as a technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone specific thing\u201d she\u2019s referring to is vibranium, a fictional substance which is Wakanda\u2019s most precious natural resource, and the key to the entire country. It drives everything there. Buildings, technology, clothes, culture\u2014it\u2019s all because of vibranium. The problem is, beyond being an unbreakable metal in Captain America\u2019s shield, there were no defined rules about it, even in the comics, where its properties had essentially mutated for decades. Both Cole and Beachler laughed when asked about defining what vibranium can and can\u2019t do and how that influenced the film itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a process,\u201d Cole explained, \u201cbecause you\u2019re actually setting up the boundaries of what your story is and what this magical property is. And so we had a lot of discussions about, \u2018What can it do? What can\u2019t it do?\u2019 And some of it was discovering what we wanted the rules to be as we were discovering the story and what we needed it to be.\u201d\n\nFor Beachler it was even more tactile. \u201cThis is where the geologists came in,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent a lot of time figuring out the stages of vibranium because up until this point we\u2019ve really only seen it in Cap\u2019s shield. It has a very stainless steel look. So it looks like they have to mine it. That\u2019s where we started.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler also knew what the Black Panther suit was going to look like, which meant it was another dot to connect. \u201cSo I went through all of that research with vibranium,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, how does it go from this raw form to an ore to fabric to a stainless look, and then what does it look like when it\u2019s mined? That exists in the world. That was our foundation for everything.\u201d\n\nBut a foundation, by definition, is only a beginning. After the story was written and the world designed and built, there was still the casting, filming, editing, music, and so much more. The journey to get Black Panther on the big screen was a long one, but it started with the ambitious ideas of a few select people who were incredibly passionate about bringing this world to life.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted Wakanda to be a big character,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe got to create this world and we wanted to root it as close to real-world Africa as possible.

Out of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the country, the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is the 2nd Whitest.\n\n2. There were 66 homicides in the city in 2014, the most in six years.\n\n3. In the last five years, there have been at least three nationally recognized stories involving the Pittsburgh police and an interaction with a Black male.\n\nA) In 2010, three plainclothes officers brutally beat Jordan Miles, a teen who was walking to his grandmother's house. The officers claimed they identified themselves as police, and beat Miles only after he ran and attempted to assault one of them. In 2014, a jury awarded Miles a $119,000 settlement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nB) In 2012, Leon Ford was stopped while driving by police officers who thought he was another person. When the officers attempted to remove him from the car, it shifted in gear. The officers shot into the car. Ford was charged with two felony counts of aggravated assault, recklessly endangering, resisting arrest and escape.\n\nAlso, as a result of the shooting, Ford is now paralyzed.\n\nC) In 2013, Dennis Henderson \u2014 a school teacher \u2014 was arrested after leaving a community activism meeting. His crime? While standing near his car talking to another person, a cop sped by so closely that Henderson had to press against his car to avoid getting hit. Henderson screamed \"Wow!\" Or, perhaps, \"Whoa! Slow down!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cop did a u-turn, got out of his car, argued with Henderson, and eventually arrested him.\n\n4. The chief McLay replaced, Nate Harper, is Black. Harper is also currently in a federal prison for conspiracy to commit theft from a federally funded program, and failure to file tax returns.\n\nAgain, Harper was the chief of the motherfucking police for seven years. And he is in prison right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, this is the world McLay entered. Since Pittsburgh doesn't exist in a vacuum, McLay is also aware of the national tension and lack of trust between many community members and the police.\n\nImmediately after taking the job, he addressed that tension and also pledged to work with the community to help restore trust. And, because \"working with the community\" to \"help restore trust\" \u2014 two mind-blowingly simple concepts \u2014 also means that certain racial disparities need to be addressed, he addressed them. He even allowed himself to be photographed while holding a sign saying \"I resolve to challenge racism at work. #endwhitesilence\" Another mind-blowingly simple concept. Seriously, saying \"You know, since I'm the chief of police, I should attempt to end certain standards and practices that might have a negative effect on our ability to do our jobs\" is like saying \"You know, since I'm married and shit, I should stop trying to fuck my wife's friends.\"\n\nNo one in their right mind could possibly be pissed about any of that.\n\nRight?\n\nWell\u2026\n\nFrom police union head Howard McQuillan:\n\n\"The chief is calling us racists. He believes the Pittsburgh Police Department is racist. This has angered a lot of officers.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesterday, Chief McLay replied to the police with one the best \"Sorry not sorry\" statements I've ever seen.\n\nAn excerpt:\n\n\n\nThe sign indicated my willingness to challenge racial problems in the workplace. I am so committed. If there are problems in the PBP related to racial injustice, I will take action to fix them. To me, the term \"white silence\" simply means that we must be willing to speak up to address issues of racial injustice, poverty, etc. In my heart, I believe we all must come together as community to address real world problems; and I am willing to be a voice to bring community together. I saw no indictment of police or anyone else in this sign, but I do apologize to any of you who felt I was not supporting you; that was not my intent. The reality of U.S. policing is that our enforcement efforts have a disparate impact on communities of color. This is a statistical fact. You know, as well as I, the social factors driving this reality. The gross disparity in wealth and opportunity is evident in our city. Frustration and disorder are certain to follow. The predominant patterns of our city's increased violence involves black victims as well as actors. If we are to address this violence, we must work together with our communities of color. We, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, need to acknowledge how this reality feels to those impacted communities. Crime and disorder take us to the disadvantaged communities, which are predominantly those of color. The disparities in police arrest and incarceration rates that follow are not by design, but they can feel that way to some people in those communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those needing an abridged summary of McLay's full statement, I've condensed it to 12 words.\n\n\"Hit dogs holler.

This weekend will see the release of Black Panther: The Album, curated and produced by Kendrick Lamar. This was a collaboration dreamed up years in advance, but only became what it was after Lamar got a sneak preview of history in the making.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Black Panther director Ryan Coogler detailed how he and Lamar came together to collaborate on the film\u2019s soundtrack. Coogler said he\u2019d been a fan of Lamar since his first mixtapes, and had touched base with him a few years ago about working together on some kind of project. The opportunity came around April 2017: Lamar had just released his latest album, DAMN, and Coogler saw an opening to get him involved in making some music for Black Panther, which Marvel supported. In order to make the offer too good to pass up, Coogler came prepared with some of the footage.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt first, he was just going to do a few songs for the film,\u201d Coogler said. \u201cThen he came in and watched quite a bit of the movie, and the next thing I know, they were booking a studio and they were going at it.\u201d\n\nLamar and Top Dawg Entertainment producer Sounwave started developing the album in the summer, with much of the work happening during the DAMN tour, which lasted from July to early September. In fact, Sounwave said about half of \u201cthe production, the hooks, and ideas\u201d were created while they were on tour. Sounwave\u2014who\u2019s a comic book fan himself\u2014added how much he admires that Marvel gave them creative control over the album\u2019s sound, feel, and voice.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only right,\u201d Sounwave says. \u201cThe movie\u2019s not set in 1910, or the 1960s when Black Panther first came out \u2014 it\u2019s set in today. There\u2019s \u2018today\u2019 moments happening in the movie, so we want the whole soundtrack to sound like that too. I think it was a perfect marriage for us to blend the two worlds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther: The Album drops February 9, and the film debuts one week later on February 16.\n\n[NPR]", "keywords": ["today", "songs", "panther", "saw", "movie", "coogler", "black", "sounwave", "soundtrack", "going", "lamar", "kendrick", "album", "came", "tour"], "polarity": 0.13997113997113997, "subjectivity": 0.47886002886002893},

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "women", "panther", "live", "movie", "watching", "thing", "love", "film", "forever", "night", "black", "opening", "went"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

And then I Googled \u201cWakanda ticket prices,\u201d as if the country were real.\n\n\n\nThe short review is: Black Panther is a thing of cinematic black excellence, and the world just has to deal. It\u2019s everything you want it to be and more. I\u2019m still hype, and I screened this movie Jan. 30 and kept my mouth shut about details all this time! I think I deserve an award.\n\nI am going to try my best to wrap up my bubbling emotions (yes, still bubbling) into a cute little package for you all, just to tell you what you already know: Ryan Coogler\u2019s Black Panther is powerful enough to shift the planet. It\u2019s like Coogler grabbed everything black people talk about in barbershops, church, kitchens, cookouts and group texts and wrapped it in Wakanda magic.\n\nImagine living in a northeastern country in Africa and having the entire world see you as a developing nation, but you\u2019re literally sitting on a gold (vibranium) mine. If you\u2019re triggered, it\u2019s because, throughout this mystifying film, Coogler reminds you of how close the themes are to what\u2019s happening or has happened in the world around us. The entire continent of Africa is often perceived as developing, when, in reality, it\u2019s a rich land of kings and queens.\n\nWakanda (much like another fan favorite with a nod to the Motherland, Coming to America\u2019s Zamunda) shows off its royalty through elaborate and blatant displays. Black Panther has a strong focus on legacy\u2014who gets to be a part of it, how far a king would go to protect his country\u2014but it also explores how the entire world changes because of an unexpected shakeup of political power (cough\u2014Donald Trump\u2014cough).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe that delivers a superhero story with heart, soul and rhythm. Black Panther confronts the conflict of being a wealthy nation refusing to disturb itself by helping the rest of the ailing world.\n\nYou can see immediately that the \u201cgood guy,\u201d T\u2019Challa, operates in a gray area. His choices are political and often clouded by his drive to protect his people. And even though the film is named for his superhero namesake and T\u2019Challa is one of the most complicated of heroes, Chadwick Boseman plays it in a way that makes room for his star-studded ensemble cast to shine bright.\n\n\n\nAnd no one shines like T\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright). Wright is what Tiffany Haddish was to Girls Trip. Her hilarious one-liners from \u201cwhatter thooooosssee\u201d to \u201ccolonizer\u201d will have you wishing she was in every scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright\u2019s Shuri works in the tech lab in the Wakanda kingdom. She\u2019s in charge of all things Black Panther. She rebels against the poised nature found in royal bloodlines and wins you over with her espressolike spunk, quick wit and mind-shattering tech talents. Shuri is a beacon for little black girls who may have been called nerds as if that were a bad thing. Watching Shuri bounce around her lab, decorated in funky paintings, walls vibrating with music, is like sharing dreams in color of all the young black girls who code.\n\n\n\nBlack Panther delivers a message of power in many forms to young black girls. Every female character in this film has an arc that makes her live long after the credits roll. Okoye (Danai Gurira) is a stunning character, but Gurira\u2019s portrayal of her makes me want to be a soldier\u2014not for America, of course\u2014for Wakanda. The Dora Milaje is a group of female soldiers devoted to T\u2019Challa\u2019s protection; they believe in their country over everything.\n\n\n\nI will not spoil it for you, but the fight scenes in which the Dora Milaje are featured will have you signing up for all kinds of self-defense courses. But it\u2019s Okoye and Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) who are the Beyonc\u00e9s of combat. As the leader of the Dora Milaje and a war dog, respectively, these women showcase a quiet inner and outer strength you\u2019d want the entire movie wrapped around. And it does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women are the stars here. From Okoye snatching off her own wig to Nakia using her heel as a weapon, there\u2019s no denying this ode to black women.\n\n\u201cShow them who you are.\u201d Ramonda (Angela Bassett) shouts at son T\u2019Challa during a battle for the throne. \u201cStand up. You are a king,\u201d T\u2019Challa\u2019s father, T\u2019Chaka says to him from the afterlife.\n\n\n\nThese may have been encouraging words for T\u2019Challa to dig in and fight harder, but they sank in for me. Black Panther was a full-on love letter to the Motherland, but there were also several smaller love notes to blackness throughout. Whether they were the cheers from Ramonda, or Nakia\u2019s Bantu knots, or the Wakanda dignitaries with lip plates, or Wakandans speaking isiXhosa, a South African language known for its tongue clicks, there was more than enough evidence of the appreciation and adoration for all things black in this film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Black Panther\u2019s villain, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is someone to be proud of. Coogler uses him as a means to explore identity, legacy and the distress of black Americans.\n\n\n\nJordan\u2019s Killmonger just might be the best villain I\u2019ve seen since Heath Ledger\u2019s the Joker. You immediately think Marvel villain Ulysses Klaue is going to be who T\u2019Challa is up against, but Killmonger shuts that down quickly.\n\nKillmonger is undoubtedly scary and will end your life without a first, second or third thought, but his heart is actually in the right place. He wants to fight for the black people who are left in America\u2019s poverty and need just a taste of the riches Wakanda offers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s the scariest villain because Killmonger actually believes in what he\u2019s doing, and, honestly, so will you. He\u2019s an advocate for black people outside of Wakanda. But we all know, black or white, Wakanda doesn\u2019t do outsiders. Without saying too much, sometimes it be your own people.\n\nKillmonger doesn\u2019t want to take Wakanda down. He wants everyone to have a piece of the kingdom\u2019s glory and is determined to make it happen by any means necessary\u2014even if that means taking down T\u2019Challa.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why Michael B. Jordan is one of Ryan Coogler\u2019s go-to stars. His range and depth are awe-inspiring. At one point, Killmonger shifts your entire morality by saying, \u201cBury me in the ocean where my ancestors jumped from ships because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoogler\u2019s genius can be seen and felt the entire time you\u2019re sitting there, thrown smack-dab into Wakanda. I get antsy after about an hour and a half during movies, but Black Panther held my attention far longer.\n\nLet\u2019s all do what we can to make sure Ryan Coogler stays protected because we need his genius. We need his storytelling and his ability to make T\u2019Challa and all of Wakanda jump off the comic book page with so much seasoning, I don\u2019t think we even deserve it.\n\nThis movie is the epitome of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d Black Panther is an entire body raised in goosebumps. It\u2019s a ride I wasn\u2019t ready for, but would gladly ride over and over again. I already know I\u2019m going to see this movie at least three more times. It\u2019s the same reason Black Panther\u2019s presale tickets have already outpaced those of any other superhero movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s about time we get to see our people in a movie like this. And this is only the beginning. We should all experience Black Panther.\n\n", "keywords": ["wakanda", "world", "panther", "movie", "villain", "black", "killmonger", "shuri", "delivers", "good", "entire", "tchalla", "blackest", "biggest", "superhero"], "polarity": 0.09222331630118515, "subjectivity": 0.47526997137652854},

But the truth is, the network has been slowly working at this for years.

Hill built his impactful work around the actual Book of Negroes, a historical record of enslaved Africans who helped the British and were granted their freedom in Nova Scotia. And this year, BET is keeping the momentum going with Madiba.\n\nStarring Laurence Fishburne as the internationally celebrated freedom fighter Nelson Mandela, Madiba, which airs over three weeks\u2014Feb. 1, 8 and 15\u2014is based on two Mandela autobiographies: Conversations With Myself and Nelson Mandela by Himself. It was filmed in South Africa, including Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for nearly three decades. The Kevin Hooks-directed miniseries is touted as one of the most personal portrayals of Mandela to date, as well as the first major production about the legend helmed by an African-American director.\n\nProductions about Mandela\u2014who rose from being a leading anti-apartheid activist with the African National Congress, resulting in a lengthy imprisonment, to become South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected and first black president\u2014have been prominent. In 2013 Idris Elba starred as the icon in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Morgan Freeman famously played the great leader in the soccer-themed Invictus, directed by Clint Eastwood, in 2009. And Terrence Howard got a shot at portraying him in Winnie Mandela, the T.D. Jakes-produced film about Mandela\u2019s famous second wife starring Jennifer Hudson, released in 2013. And now Fishburne, who is best-known these days as Pops from the ABC hit sitcom Black-ish, is taking his turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe miniseries spans the period from Mandela\u2019s life as a child until his historic election as president. Except for a very brief time, the 55-year-old Fishburne plays Mandela from roughly his mid-20s until his mid-70s. As strong an actor as Fishburne is, this move doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for the first installment of the miniseries. But as it plays on, the story and his age gel more.\n\nAlso, unlike other Mandela productions, his comrades are particularly prominent. So fellow ANC activists such as Walter Sisulu, who is credited with bringing Mandela into the ANC and is played by David Harewood from the series Supergirl, as well as nonblack comrades Joe Slovo (Jason Kennett), Ahmed Kathrada (Meren Reddy) and Ruth First (Kate Liquorish), make an appearance.\n\nOrlando Jones, who plays Mandela\u2019s law partner and closest friend, Oliver Tambo, is surprisingly outstanding\u2014actually, unrecognizably so. It may take a while for Drumline\u2019s Dr. Lee to register, if he ever registers at all. Terry Pheto, who plays Winnie, is the rare black South African in a prominent role, and she is particularly compelling, especially in the final installment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those familiar with Mandela\u2019s history and that of the ANC, there will be no real surprises. Madiba\u2014\u201cMadiba\u201d is Mandela\u2019s Xhosa name (Xhosa is South Africa\u2019s second-largest ethnic group after the Zulus)\u2014is a pretty faithful history, capturing key moments like Mandela\u2019s early rise to prominence; his role in radicalizing the ANC; his Rivonia trial, which sent him and his comrades to Robben Island; his time at Robben Island, as well as the Sharpeville massacre in 1960; the Soweto student uprising in 1976; the questionable death of popular leader Steve Biko; and the assassination of youth leader Chris Hani.\n\nA recurring theme is the stress Mandela\u2019s activism placed on his wives and children. It is very clear that Mandela\u2019s activism came at a huge personal price. The increasing tension between him and Winnie is particularly compelling.\n\n\n\nWhile BET should certainly be commended for stepping up to the original-programming plate in such a big way and for recognizing the need to tell historic black stories of the United States and the African continent, a Madiba miniseries exploring Mandela\u2019s presidency, the changing South Africa and his death might have been a better approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not that this one isn\u2019t of value. After all, if U.S. schools barely teach black American history, they certainly don\u2019t teach South African history. And one of the most enlightening aspects of Madiba is the obvious parallels it makes to the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the rise of black nationalism in this country. At times, Mandela is both Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, but toward the end he is a little Obama, too.\n\n\n\nUltimately, the folks at BET are banking that, when it comes to anything Mandela, they just can\u2019t go wrong. And here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re right.\n\nMadiba airs on BET on Feb. 1, 8 and 15 at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT.", "keywords": ["fishburne", "south", "bet", "plays", "starring", "icon", "bets", "african", "class", "mandelas", "miniseries", "history", "black", "session", "anc", "laurence", "madiba", "mandela"], "polarity": 0.13825716477615219, "subjectivity": 0.4903770069592853},

At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood.

Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call.

It\u2019s not the answer we expected, but it accurately describes a high-tech spy adventure, set in an insular world where warring factions vie for leadership. But, last year on the Atlanta set of the highly anticipated superhero film, we learned there\u2019s much, much more going on.\n\nMore so than almost any Marvel movie before it, Black Panther has had an impossible task. Guardians of the Galaxy introduced a whole new section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; Thor created an entirely new civilization, Black Panther has to do both of those things while making them them feel realistic enough to exist on Earth. The setting is Wakanda, a fictional African country whose abundance of the metal vibranium has made it incredibly rich and technologically advanced. It may look otherworldly, but it\u2019s part of our world, even though it remained hidden from the rest of it\u2014at least until T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman) revealed himself to the world as the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. But it\u2019s when the prince-turned-king returns home that Black Panther, directed by Creed\u2019s Ryan Coogler, begins.\n\nThe murder of King T\u2019Chaka and T\u2019Challa\u2019s sudden ascension to the throne have put Wakanda in turmoil, as summed up by what Moore called the questions at the heart of the film: \u201cWho rules Wakanda? How does Wakanda now deal with the loss of a king, who was a fair king, who people seemed to like? And is T\u2019Challa ready to be the king of Wakanda?\u201d\n\nBoseman explained that, at the start of the film, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t have time to think about being a superhero. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with making the transition to filling the footsteps of his father,\u201d the actor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s probably going to feel like it\u2019s more about the political unrest than the superhero, initially.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat unrest will lead to a multi-faceted struggle between Wakanda and the CIA, in the form of Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman); fringe villains like Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis); power-hungry adversaries like Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan); and several other factions among the tribes that make up Wakanda. And that\u2019s not to mention T\u2019Challa\u2019s conflicting desires to help the world at large, but also keep his country both safe and secret.\n\nIn designing the look of not just the people of Wakanda, but the country itself, Coogler asked his longtime production designer Hannah Beachler for help. The two literally traveled the world from Africa to Korea and back, looking for inspirations, and came back with a movie that looks incredibly unique. \u201cHe always drags me into things I\u2019m not expecting I would ever do in my life,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo it\u2019s challenging and keeps me doing something new all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile on set last February, we were granted access to a conference room that had its walls lined with Beachler\u2019s work. It was overwhelming, especially several months before anyone outside of the production had seen the expansive, evocative aesthetic of the film. There were images of a huge spiral staircases made of metal and sand. Sweeping vistas of Wakandan landmarks\u2014like Mount Bashenga, the huge waterfalls of Warrior Falls, and the metal-meets-natural look of Golden City. \u201cOne of the things that we really wanted to be sure about Wakanda is the technology,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that all the fans want to see. \u2018What is this advanced civilization?\u2019 But the other thing that we really talked about was keeping the traditions of several different African tribes. So we really delved in to what that was, and how we mix this new and this old.\u201d\n\n(Here\u2019s a gallery of just some of that awesome art)\n\nShuri\u2019s Lab illustration by Drew Leung Steptown illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak Palace Throne Room illustration by Till Nowak 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat new and old, a blending of African influences and advanced technology, is encapsulated in the designs of the Royal Talon and Talon Fighter. Each is an ultra-advanced ship, kind of like the Avengers\u2019 Quinjet, but only if you look at them from the sides. From the top, the ships are actually in the shape of an African mask. And though that sounds like a fairly radical idea, Beachler said her design was rooted in a future that\u2019s actually attainable. \u201cIt\u2019s not far off,\u201d Beachler said. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the conceptual ideas and designs that people are bringing, and we just are going to take it and show people, \u2018This is how it can be incorporated into a society.\u2019 So it\u2019s super-fun in that way.\u201d\n\nMore fun designs included images of a vibranium mine (which kind of looked like a scene from Tron, set underground, and which may be the setting for one of Black Panther\u2019s fight scenes), as well as T\u2019Challa riding a rhino, which is one of Wakanda\u2019s most precious animals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there was the Hall of Kings and City of the Dead, which evoke both the lush world of Pandora in Avatar and Westeros from Game of Thrones, where it appears the Wakandans pay tribute to past Black Panthers. \u201cIn the architecture and some of the dressing you\u2019ll get an idea of Panthers throughout the centuries,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a little bit of it but I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be a big part of the film.\u201d\n\nDespite the executive producer\u2019s claim, the concept art we saw suggested otherwise; it looked like T\u2019Challa would perform some kind of astral projection that would allow the audience to see a bit of himself as a child, and Beachler hinted at this, too. \u201cYou see a lot of masks, all the panther masks, and you see how they do a lot of their rituals... and it will be fabulous and wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then also the dream states that he goes into when he meets the ancestors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Black Panther\u2019s other challenges is, if Wakanda is more advanced than anywhere else on Earth (and it is), it has to exceed any and everything we\u2019ve seen before in Earth-based Marvel movies. \u201c[Iron Man] was the one that set the pace for what you know as being futuristic [with Marvel],\u201d Beachler said. \u201cSo we did have to be mindful of how we\u2019re going to make it different. And we wanted Wakandans, and especially T\u2019Challa, to do the same things, but not have it be as recognizable as what Tony Stark is doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis technology is also where Black Panther finds its politics. \u201cJust the idea of Wakanda being a nation in Africa that is the most technologically advanced in the world is a political statement without us having to go too much far past that.\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think if people knew they had vibranium, which they do, they were going to be conquered or at least be at war forever. So they did the smart thing. They hid that fact so nobody knows they have this stuff. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to have these advancements. They don\u2019t spend money on war. They don\u2019t spend money defending themselves constantly. They just spend money on infrastructure which is something, again, that will feel topical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the resources, advancement, and prosperity of Wakanda, a character like Shuri can exist. Played by Letitia Wright, Shuri is the smartest person in Wakanda and leader of their technological development. She\u2019s also T\u2019Challa\u2019s 16-year-old sister. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you see a superhero with a little sister,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo I think it brings out a different part of his character. Usually you have the damsel in distress [but] I don\u2019t think there are any damsels in distress in this movie.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. Coogler and his team have packed Black Panther with many, many strong black women. Paramount among them are the members of the Dora Milaje, the personal security for the King of Wakanda. However, while in the comics these warrior characters are at times sexualized, that\u2019s not the case in this film. Moore described them as more of a \u201cSEAL Team Six,\u201d each with their own unique characteristics and personalities. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t expect, and what [Coogler] really wanted to explore, is the depth of the emotional connections between T\u2019Challa and those individuals,\u201d he said. In other words, according to costume designer Ruth Carter, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the guy in the skin suit walking around with the girls in the bathing suits.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Dora Milaje, another classic Black Panther character in the film is Erik Killmonger, played by Coogler\u2019s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan. The actor said while the character is certainly a villain, he\u2019d more accurately described him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTrue villains, the really good ones and the interesting ones, the watchable ones, truly believe what they\u2019re doing is the right thing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAnd if you can somehow blur that line for the people\u2026 if you can kind of get them to see that other point of view, I think the battle\u2019s won.\u201d So it seems Killmonger\u2019s taste for power will have some form of selfless motivation to it, while Jordan will act them out in nearly unrecognizable fashion. His costume looks like a military Dragon Ball Z mash-up, complete with blue armor plates, beads holding it together, fatigue pants, gold teeth, and dreadlocks.\n\nKillmonger isn\u2019t the only other villain T\u2019Challa must deal with in Black Panther. There\u2019s also Ulysses Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. His performance there sets the tone here. \u201cKlaw doesn\u2019t really trust or work with anybody; he is his own man,\u201d Serkis said. \u201cHe does deals with people, he interacts, but he doesn\u2019t form allegiances or alliances with anyone. Ultimately, he\u2019s a lone wolf. He has these pop-up groups wherever he happens to be in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose uncertain alliances seemed to be at the center of the scene Coogler and his team were filming when we were on set. The scene shot on February 3, 2017 featured Klaw, Killmonger, T\u2019Challa, Ross, Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), and Okoye (Danai Gurira), and took place at a CIA safehouse in South Korea where Klaw has been captured. T\u2019Challa and Okoye have just shown up and Ross is upset with them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before,\u201d he says. \u201cHow much more do you know?\u201d Just then, Nakia bursts in, speaking quickly in the African language Hausa. Suddenly a bomb goes off, the wall comes down, the window to the interrogation room cracks, and in storms KIllmonger and his crew, guns blazing. In the attack, T\u2019Challa somehow changes into his Black Panther suit and jumps on top of a grenade to save everyone, while bullets fly everywhere.\n\nThis scene was shot practically, including the two explosions. A major safety meeting was held on set beforehand and multiple rehearsals took place to make sure everyone was perfect on the timing. Boseman dynamically pushed himself up off the ground to really sell the grenade explosion. Multiple takes, increasing the coverage of the scene, were shot throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actors were unsurprisingly secretive about why Killmonger would be breaking Klaw out of this situation, as well as the rest of the film\u2019s plot. However, Moore said the film\u2019s main inspirations come from the current comic run of writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and the classic Black Panther stories of Christopher Priest, as well as some of the designs from those runs. There will be humor, but tonally Black Panther will be more Winter Soldier than Ant-Man. And though this is the last Marvel film which will be released before Avengers: Infinity War, it\u2019s not a set-up for that film.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give Ryan the freedom to tell a story that wasn\u2019t relying on other things that were happening in the MCU,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean what happens in the film won\u2019t have ripples in the MCU, but the film itself isn\u2019t relying on other plot points in the MCU.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end though, everyone involved really just wants fans to fall in love with the Black Panther and his country. \u201cImagine a whole world that is going to open up to audiences,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther opens February 16.\n\n*Correction: We had incorrectly labeled Hausa as an only south African language.

Moore also pointed out that T\u2019Challa isn\u2019t just the first black superhero to headline a Marvel film, he\u2019s the first African superhero:\n\n\u201cI make that distinction because it\u2019s something that we found very important in making the film\u2014that T\u2019Challa and Wakanda felt very African. And so we, with Ryan especially leading the charge, were going the extra mile to get all the details of what that would mean in the film.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Coogler knew he would need to travel to Africa, not just for the actual production of the film, but so that he could have a better understanding of what it was like to be on the continent and amongst its people.

And now I\u2019m rethinking my wardrobing choices for opening night Feb. 16, because while my body is ready, after looking at Lupita and the Dora Milaje-clad actresses, I\u2019m clearly not well-dressed enough for Wakanda.

We are entirely here for it\u2014and hope you are, too.

Weinstein had not only donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party but had also hosted fundraisers that the Obamas attended. But the allegations hit particularly close to home for the Obamas because Malia had just wrapped up a coveted internship with the mogul\u2019s production company a few months ago.\n\nFrom CBS News:\n\nMichelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture \u2014 including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect \u2014 so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\n\nMalia landed her internship with the Weinstein Co. earlier this year, working with the production and development department. Many have speculated about what the 19-year-old may have known about the Hollywood producer\u2019s alleged predatory behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie joined the growing list of women who claim that Weinstein harassed or abused them.\n\nOne of the stronger condemnations of Hollywood\u2019s treatment of women came from Black Panther director Ryan Coogler. The director\u2019s debut, Fruitvale Station, about the death of Oscar Grant at the hands of a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer in 2009, was released by the Weinstein Co.\n\nShadow and Act released Coogler\u2019s statement in full. The acclaimed filmmaker said he was \u201cdisturbed and saddened\u201d by the news, adding that he was unaware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior but felt a responsibility to speak on the issue because of his connection to the producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Coogler didn\u2019t stop there:\n\nI love working as a storyteller. But I work in an industry that too many times has proven to not be a safe space for women. I make it a priority to ensure that there is gender equity and an inclusive work environment on every project I am involved with. However, just minding our business sometimes isn\u2019t enough. It goes without saying, but I will state it now: sexual harassment is a human rights violation, sexual assault is a human rights violation, rape is a human rights violation. The entertainment industry, like many others, has a historic imbalance of power among gender that allows these violations to run rampant. As men we sit in positions of privilege. It is our responsibility to leverage our position, and be allies to the women in our industry. We need to do everything we can to make sure violations like these don\u2019t continue to happen. The first step is to listen. Salute to the brave women who came forward. I could never imagine how difficult that must be.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Coogler has been walking the talk on gender inclusivity in Hollywood, unlike some of the actors and directors who have given lukewarm expressions of shock at the Weinstein allegations.\n\nThe scandal, long regarded as an \u201copen secret\u201d in Hollywood, according to some reports, has forced the entertainment industry to confront the ways it enables and reinforces systems of abuse and exploitation. The Weinstein story in particular has prompted many big names to come out about harassment they\u2019ve suffered. On Tuesday, former NFL player and comedic actor Terry Crews opened up about being groped at a party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHollywood is not the only business [where] this happens,\u201d Crews warned. \u201cAnd to the casualties of this behavior\u2014you are not alone.\u201d\n\nRead more at CBS News.", "keywords": ["hollywood", "women", "harvey", "say", "industry", "violation", "rights", "obamas", "human", "weinstein", "sexual", "released"], "polarity": 0.07222222222222222, "subjectivity": 0.46475308641975305},

In documenting just how vast and entrenched inequality has been for African Americans specifically, Coates also casts a side eye to the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps trope favored by so many because \u2026 well, there were no boots to speak of. African-American disparity, you see, is \u201ca difference of kind.\u201d No. If we are going to talk about reparations, payment for \u201cmulticentury plunder of black people in America,\u201d we must look to the bedrock of this nation\u2019s very foundation and the lens through which we view ourselves.\n\nAbout a year later, Coates released Between the World and Me, a tome Toni Morrison hailed as \u201crequired reading,\u201d cementing him as one of America\u2019s foremost public intellectuals. The accolades came fast and furious: Coates was tapped to write a Black Panther comic book series, and he won a National Book Award and then a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant,\u201d with a $625,000 windfall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI won all of that money,\u201d he concedes. \u201cThat\u2019s probably been the biggest change in my life.

[and] you end up with 900,000 Twitter followers, it\u2019s different,\u201d he tells The Root. \u201cI think you have a number of writers, or people in general, who have fame as a goal, and I\u2019m just being straight with you\u2014this is not false modesty\u2014I just didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe object always, he says, was \u201cto be the baddest motherfucking writer on the planet.\u201d Not the baddest black writer, mind you, but the baddest writer on the planet. \u201cNow, this is the sort of thing that could make you famous,\u201d he says, laughing, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think about that.\n\n\u201cWho cares about writers? That was my perspective,\u201d he adds. \u201cNot even saying I got there, but the pursuit is a part of the change that\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nThese days, in addition to penning an occasional essay for The Atlantic, Coates says that he\u2019s looking forward to teaching a class on the essay at New York University\u2019s Arthur L. Carter School of Journalism in the fall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s also readying for the release of his book We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy (One World), to be released in October. Coates explains that the title comes from black Reconstruction-era Rep. Thomas Miller, who plaintively noted at the South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1895, \u201cWe were eight years in power,\u201d and then questioned why Southern whites despised blacks so much, when their works during Reconstruction were good.\n\n\u201cIt had tremendous echoes of what happened with [Barack] Obama,\u201d Coates says. \u201cIt was the fact that they were so successful that made them targets. I think the book tries to wrestle with that, in addition to my own experiences as a writer during the [Obama presidency].\u201d\n\nCoates is currently working on a script based on the New Yorker magazine piece \u201cWrong Answer,\u201d a school-cheating scandal that saw black teachers and administrators in Atlanta jailed.

Specifically, Hollywood wunderkind Ryan Coogler is concerned about the artist, instructing him to zip up his coat.\n\nBut despite being one of the hottest writer-directors in the industry, Coogler is merely an observer tonight, having quietly sneaked onto the set to support younger brother Noah\u2014better known as rapper White Dave\u2014as he films the video for his most recent single, \u201cNervous.\u201d\n\nYoungest brother Keenan is also on hand; between takes, the three dance and clown with one another in the rainy streets. It\u2019s a rare glimpse at what the brothers may have been like as boys growing up in the Bay Area city of Richmond, Calif.\n\nIn fact, it was a childhood trope that prompted Ryan to rechristen the artist formerly known as Noah David as \u201cWhite Dave.\u201d Noah tells The Root: \u201cComing up, a lot of people used to try to discredit my blackness and discredit my \u2018down-ness,\u2019 because they said I talked \u2018white.\u2019 And it used to get under my skin a lot when I was younger.

The family\u2019s \u201cPerform well, play hard\u201d ethic was vital in keeping their three sons off the streets and on the straight and narrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow 26, Noah has a deeper appreciation for being sheltered from some grim realities. He says:\n\nThere was a lot of stuff going on in my neighborhood and in my city that I wasn\u2019t aware of, simply because my parents did their best to keep us out of it. I tell my parents \u201cthank you\u201d every day because they had three sons and raised them up in Richmond. I read a statistic that said 1 in 3 black boys raised in an urban environment end up either dead or in jail. I think my folks did a really good job, if that\u2019s the case. Richmond\u2019s a very violent city. And I remember\u2014I was in either sixth or seventh grade\u2014there was a football star from our city; his name was Terrance Kelly, from De La Salle [High School]. He had just signed to Oregon State; he was one of the biggest recruits in the country. Somebody shot and killed him while he was outside of his cousin\u2019s house. At that point, my parents were telling us how nobody\u2019s safe, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. Nobody cares who you are. He was kinda like a spokesman for the kids of Richmond. He was the one who was gonna get out and make it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days, Richmond has another hometown hero in Ryan Coogler, whose recent trailer for Marvel\u2019s upcoming Black Panther movie not only left us collectively clamoring for its February 2018 release but also threatened to overshadow Game 4 of the NBA Finals altogether.\n\nBut despite his own success, big brother Ryan\u2014or \u201cDad No. 2,\u201d as Noah fondly calls him\u2014has a sincere interest in fostering his brother\u2019s career, too, giving him his first recording equipment, early placements on the Fruitvale Station and Creed soundtracks, and introducing him to publicist and manager Cali Green, who worked with the elder Coogler as an event producer on the #JusticeforFlint benefit.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you meet [Noah], you root for him,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with Noah, one clearly hears the passion for music that began when he was an 8- or 9-year-old spitting his first rhyme to an instrumental of Usher\u2019s \u201cMy Way\u201d and crafting early beats on a Casio keyboard given to him by his mother. \u201cI would race home, and every day after school and after practice, I\u2019d make a beat. \u2026 I made my first song when I was 12 years old,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time he reached high school, his beats were in demand by friends and area hip-hop artists alike, cementing his aspirations to become a producer. But his skills as a rapper were less well received\u2014a fact that never deterred him, in part because the situation echoed the trajectory of one of his idols, Kanye West. \u201cI remember he used to always talk about how no one gave him the shot at rapping, because he was a producer first. \u2026 When I first started, nobody was fuckin\u2019 with my shit, either. They was like, \u2018Your beats [are] tight, but you garbage.\u2019 But then, as I kept at it\u2014I kept grindin\u2019 and kept workin\u2019\u2014it all panned out,\u201d Noah says.\n\n\u201cPanned out\u201d may be an understatement, if Noah\u2019s recent work is any indication. In addition to the January release of The Season of the Rich, his recent credits include the title track for critically acclaimed independent film Kicks (starring Mahershala Ali and Kofi Siriboe, among others). Meanwhile, gaming enthusiasts might recognize his infectious single \u201cBands\u201d from hit video game \u201cNBA 2K17.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Noah\u2019s most popular to date, but like his mixtape, he considers it just a taste of his capabilities: \u201cFor me, getting music off is like a purge. That\u2019s what I made [The] Season of the Rich to be. I made it to be a compilation of songs that I want people to listen to, and get an overall feel of who I am and what I do. When I craft my first album, it\u2019ll be something that I craft from the ground up. An album should be an experience; it should be a feeling. It should be something that takes you to another level.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNoah predicts that that experience will eventually include an evolution beyond White Dave\u2014and rap\u2014into other genres. But in the immediate future, we can look forward to a more socially conscious sound, perhaps the type of awareness Noah hints at in his next single, \u201cHella.\u201d The track samples the iconic \u201cReturn of the Mack\u201d\u2014a Coogler childhood staple\u2014and recounts his return home after dropping out of Sacramento State a few years ago. Noah recalls:\n\n\n\nAt that time, I remember coming home\u2014my initial homecoming from college wasn\u2019t a warm one. It was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re taking this risk; I can\u2019t believe that you said fuck your future and you\u2019re gonna try this rap shit.\u201d It was tough for my parents to accept that decision that I\u2019d made. But what \u201cHella\u201d really represents is, it\u2019s a homecoming, but it\u2019s also\u2014it\u2019s an official proclamation that I\u2019m a rapper. Like, I\u2019m officially dropped out of school; there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s gonna hold me back from pursuing this dream that I\u2019ve had. I\u2019m officially an artist, this is what I\u2019m gonna do, and I\u2019m officially making that statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe soon-to-be-released video was shot at his parents\u2019 home and features the Coogler clan\u2014minus Ryan, who refuses to distract from his brother\u2019s shine. Noah says, \u201cOne thing that was always awesome was the support that I received from them. They didn\u2019t necessarily like my decision, but they supported me nonetheless. And that\u2019s why I wanted to be sure that I included them in the video. Because everything ties together; and that\u2019s one of the overarching themes, is my relationship with my family.\u201d\n\nFor the Cooglers, it truly is a family affair. And while talented families aren\u2019t an anomaly in the entertainment business (see: the Knowles sisters, the Jacksons, etc.), Noah assures us that there is still more to come\u2014and not just from him: \u201cKeenan is really the one that everyone should watch out for, on the low.\u201d\n\nThe Season of the Rich is available on Spotify and Soundcloud; watch White Dave on YouTube, and follow him on social media @chillblanko.", "keywords": ["ryan", "video", "richmond", "coogler", "used", "cooglers", "rises", "dave", "white", "thats", "parents", "noah", "im", "brother"], "polarity": 0.0749002043061449, "subjectivity": 0.40323039446801817},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even among our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\nEspecially in considering Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th president\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u201cexclude the idea of color as race,\u201d she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling just over a week ago, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, one made by American (semi-)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Ala. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great Southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the Stars and Stripes famously hand-sewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that makes up the country her husband so recently led?\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown at the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South:\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u201ctruthful\u201d\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Ala., with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 census. In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. visited the enclave\u2014primarily African American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry\u2014three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York City mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the Creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be shortsighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former first lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because, ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder? Said Cabrera:\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out, and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us who, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic for our first black first lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d", "keywords": ["dress", "portrait", "obama", "gees", "quilts", "bend", "included", "think", "picture", "black", "michelle", "lady"], "polarity": 0.14501168400422132, "subjectivity": 0.4232492838836122},

If she has her way, the power and impact of African-American contribution to fashion design will be eternal.\n\nTo that end, Henderson gathered together a powerhouse crew of New York\u2019s most influential black bloggers, editors and journalists for the first Black Fashion History Dinner on the eve of New York Fashion Week 2018. Famed restaurant Red Rooster of Harlem was the venue for a panel discussion featuring star guest Dapper Dan, among others, moderated by veteran fashion journalist Teri Agins, who is the author of the insider fashion books The End of Fashion and Hijacking the Runway.\n\nThe discussion opened with Agins declaring that \u201ccollaboration is the future of fashion!\u201d Dapper Dan\u2014now collaborating with former fashion foe Gucci from a newly refurbished townhouse in Harlem that\u2019s Gucci branded from stoop to roof\u2014dove right in on the subject:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe difference between me and a designer is that they create from their [own] minds,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people need a say in how they look.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome say that Dapper Dan, through his early-\u201980s remixing of logo brands like Gucci, MCM and Louis Vuitton into one-of-a-kind pieces for the hip-hop and elite street hustlers, defined a golden era of fashion. There was a time when Dan was known as the \u201cKing of Counterfeit\u201d for reworking motifs of European heritage designers infused with an uptown swagger\u2014most recognizably his custom leather tracksuits hand-screened with LV and Gucci logos that caused the conglomerates to sue him out of business 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do knockoffs; I do knock-ups,\u201d he told the crowd\n\nCollaboration is the cornerstone of Dan\u2019s business, from his customers\u2014\u201cAlthough sometimes I do have to tell people what they have in their mind won\u2019t work in reality,\u201d he says\u2014to huge corporations like Gucci. He kept the Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row crowd laughing and learning, especially when it came to the subject of business. His multiyear deal with luxury powerhouse Kering\u2014underwriters of Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent, among other labels\u2014is one that he held out for in negotiations, saying, \u201cI wanted a partnership where I can be on the same trajectory, producing with the same dignity and respect as Tom Ford or Marc Jacobs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Dap advised younger designers that \u201ctechnology is the palette of the future,\u201d his closing wisdom was about preserving our legacy: \u201cHarlem has a global [design] currency that we need to hold on to, not let it go like we let Harlem go with gentrification.\u201d\n\nPost-panel, Omar Salam, a relative unknown, yet one of the most skilled and exciting designers now showing, gave a knockout presentation of his Sukeina line. Salaam killed it with marabou-trimmed cocktail dresses, structured jackets and sleek sheaths with embroidered bodices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarlem\u2019s Fashion Row gave us a very bright glimpse at black fashion\u2019s future built on our fashion legacy. The evening\u2019s mission? To harness our collective power to share information and make black-owned businesses grow.\n\nSharing information is exactly how Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row began. By chance, Henderson met Lois Alexander Lane, the fashion historian who founded the now defunct Black Fashion Museum, who at the time was compiling a book project on the history of African-American designers, called Fashion in Color. It was a labor of love, which, upon her death, Lane passed on to Henderson to continue.\n\nHenderson found her calling, and on this evening, with some of black fashion\u2019s most important influencers gathered in one room, she made her mission clear: Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row exists \u201cto present opportunities to expand a designer\u2019s visibility by having them show their collection at events with fashion influencers. Moving forward, our goal is to connect designers with revenue-generating opportunities with large brands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve presented over 50 designers\u2014including CFDA winner Telfar Waraire Boswell\u2014to buyers, press and fashion professionals. Henderson, now profitable through a combination of speaking engagements, corporate-sponsored events and selling designers on her site, developed by Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row, has an even bigger endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cI want to create a label that allows us to work with designers of color across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to use the label to launch the designer with HFR x Designer collaborations that would provide revenue for designers.\u201d\n\nSo what can we do to support the future of black fashion design? \u201cTalk about it. Even if you can\u2019t buy it, talk about it!\u201d Henderson says. Which makes sense: Gucci is not famous in our community because we all buy it but because we all talk about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other thing we can do is support our own legacy. Henderson says: \u201cWe would love people to download our new book, Fashion in Color, on our website. It\u2019s free! We would also love to have people shop the designers we feature on our website and our podcast.\u201d", "keywords": ["harlems", "row", "designers", "according", "talk", "hands", "harlem", "black", "future", "henderson", "fashion", "gucci", "bnyfw"], "polarity": 0.12743487506645404, "subjectivity": 0.41577428419533685},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["wakanda", "till", "welcome", "panther", "stage", "venue", "york", "week", "black", "guests", "designer", "bnyfw"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

This preschool teacher-turned-women\u2019s financial educator knows that everything you need to know about how to manage your money, you did not learn in kindergarten. She is the author of the Amazon No. 1 best-selling book The One Week Budget: Learn to Create Your Money Management System in 7 Days or Less! and creator of the Live Richer Challenge, a series of 22-day courses, which to date have helped revolutionize the financial habits of more than 500,00 women from all 50 states and 100 countries.\n\n\n\nEver the teacher, Aliche tells The Glow Up she created the challenge to give women access to \u201cknowledge and community ... because that\u2019s where we came from as Africans.\u201d\n\nAnd if it takes a village, you can count on Aliche to build one; the Live Richer Challenge comes with a 270,000-strong 24-7 Facebook support group called the Dream Catchers.\n\nThe Live Richer Challenge starts with creating the \u201cWealthy Mindset.\u201d Step 1 is calculating the worth of your home\u2014which goes far beyond just the property you own. Aliche asks me, if I were to cash them in today, do I know the value of my jewelry or individual retirement account and insurance policies? Admittedly, I don\u2019t. But insurance and IRAs figure largely in individual net worth. According to the Budgetnista, most policies are worth 50 percent or less if cashed in before term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy day 2, you\u2019ll know your net worth and the difference between being able to pay for something versus truly being able to afford something. Aliche says, \u201cYeah, you might be able to buy that BMW, but if it breaks down, do you have the money to fix it?\u201d By day 3, you might be ready to snap your wallet shut.\n\nEveryone wants to know: How do I get to have more and owe less? Week 2 challenges focus on increasing your net worth by first identifying your skill set to create a side hustle.\n\nAliche says that sadly, only 1 in 5 women negotiates her salary. As a first-generation Nigerian immigrant, Aliche is no stranger to negotiating\u2014her parents insisted that their five daughters bargain for every purchase, from apples to appliances. She shows women how to negotiate their salaries and stop leaving that money on the table. She says, \u201cOnce you get that money; then there\u2019s the other side of the net-worth equation: Saving, investing and paying down debt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAliche cites a Prudential Bond (pdf) biannual survey that reports that African Americans\u2019 No. 1 financial goal is to be debt-free.\n\n\u201cIt sounds noble, but it\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever be\u2014debt-free\u2014and it doesn\u2019t mean anything. There are people who have a million dollars in debt but are billionaires. I want to shift that thinking that we\u2019re not just here to be debt-free.\u201d\n\nAliche is just paying off a $50,000 student loan after consulting with a debt-forgiveness specialist, successfully wiping $20,000 of the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, imagine if all of these years, instead of building a business, I focused on paying off the loan?\u201d she says. Instead, Aliche\u2019s introducing new #Squad Goals: \u201cFocus all of your energy on creating wealth.\u201d\n\nThe final phase of the Live Richer Challenge is maintenance. Get rid of liabilities and maintain your net worth. What can you do to make sure you don\u2019t get back into debt? Thrift first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBuying a new car is the biggest waste of money,\u201d says Aliche, who just treated herself to a 2-year-old used car.\n\nShe\u2019s also challenging us to \u201cnot be afraid to make more.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman gave me permission to soar\u2014to move beyond a six-figure business into an eight-figure business,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat convinced Aliche, who religiously gives 10 percent of her income to charity, was that while she was doing great for herself, there was so much more good she could accomplish. \u201cIf I make a million, that\u2019s 100K for my nonprofits,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat\u2019s the endgame? A billion-dollar venture capital business is the next big score for the coach of the Dream Catcher team.\n\nLess than 1 percent of minority businesses pass the $1 million mark in funding; a figure Aliche repeats several times, in defiance and disbelief. But one thing she does believe is that she could do an enormous amount of good being the final decision-maker in boardrooms from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, fielding pitches that would revolutionize the African-American marketplace. For instance: What about funding a perm that won\u2019t damage your hair?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the power of a seat at the table: If the money people in the room don\u2019t know your life, they don\u2019t know the potential of your product pitch. Aliche sees the dream: \u201cI want to be on the cover of Forbes: Brown girl. \u2018Billion Dollar Business\u2019\u2014with my locs and dark skin.\u201d Now, that\u2019s rich.", "keywords": ["till", "richer", "antibroke", "women", "right", "live", "money", "challenge", "net", "wait", "thats", "2018", "cure", "budgetnistas", "aliche", "worth", "know"], "polarity": 0.16024234886175184, "subjectivity": 0.4290535956580733},

You asked, and I got the answers on the best chemical peels and lasers for darker skin tones.\n\n\n\nDuring last week\u2019s \u201csnow bomb cyclone,\u201d I checked in with Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained New York City dermatologist, to talk about the latest offerings in her practice. As a black woman herself, she had plenty of advice to offer The Glow Up about using lasers and peels on melanin-rich skin.\n\n\u201cFor the darkest skin types, I like the Clear and Brilliant laser for resurfacing. I will also use the Fraxel laser with lower settings,\u201d Henry says.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used both of these treatments, and they do remove every line and every speck of discoloration on the skin. The doctor warns that the effects aren\u2019t permanent, though. \u201cA newer laser that is safe for all skin types is the Infini laser. It combines microneedling and radio frequency, so it tightens and corrects textural issues,\u201d she says.\n\nThis new generation of lasers allows the physician to tailor the treatment specifically to each issue on a patient\u2019s face, whereas previous generations of lasers obliged the doctor to treat the face with multiple processes. Including microneedling is part of that tailoring, using microscopic needles to puncture the skin, causing controlled wounding that stimulates the natural healing process and the production of collagen, which restores both radiance and elasticity to the surface of the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor specific tightening and toning, Henry says, \u201cI love using the Aerolase 1064 Laser for skin rejuvenation and laser toning in darker skin types.\u201d\n\nDesigned to deal with thicker areas of the skin, this laser is helpful for acne scars, stretch marks, spider veins, keloid revision and fungal issues with nails, among other things. Scars can thankfully now be permanently removed, commonly in about two to four treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the best peels for African-American skin? \u201cMy go-to peels are the Vitalize Peel and VI Peel. Both are very effective but safe for all skin types,\u201d says Henry. \u201cThe VI Peel is a deeper peel, so I use it for hyperpigmentation and textural issues.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve personally used peels, and they\u2019re generally quick and painless\u2014with the exception of a few minutes of stinging or tingling, depending on your level of pain tolerance. During treatment, a small handheld fan is often offered to reduce the temporary stinging sensation. Peels takes about 45 minutes in total, and the downtime is 24 hours without makeup. I\u2019ve yet to try either of Henry\u2019s favorite peels, but I\u2019m about due for one. Once I do, I\u2019ll let you know what the doctor orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, living life brings the fine lines back over time; the better you treat yourself with diet, hydration and exercise, the longer the smoothing effect lasts.\n\nTry to avoid factors like alcohol, junk food and sleep deprivation in order to preserve your investment in any treatment. Sun exposure and hormonal changes can trigger the return of discoloration on the skin. And no matter our skin tone, we should all use products with sun protection factor because cancer\u2014including melanoma\u2014doesn\u2019t discriminate. If you live right, you can get up to two years of lasting effects from these treatments.", "keywords": ["plastic", "life", "peels", "treatment", "regular", "surgery", "live", "using", "laserandpeel", "peel", "laser", "doctor", "facetune", "skin", "lasers", "henry", "redcarpet", "types"], "polarity": 0.21186278368096553, "subjectivity": 0.43090318772136954},

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["life", "dressed", "dj", "women", "wardrobe", "sophia", "york", "inside", "feel", "night", "hyacinthe", "think", "double", "fashion", "really", "career", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

She\u2019s built a successful and evolving brand that started on the strength of one product: her best-selling \u201cLip Whip.\u201d Famed for smudge-free saturation in no fewer than 45 shades (and counting), the day-to-night finish is vegan, nontoxic and 100 percent cruelty-free ... and so tough to budge that it requires its own remover.\n\nAccording to Cashmere Nicole, it was a formula built out of necessity:\n\nI think Beauty Bakerie introduced a lifestyle change; a complete makeover or face-lift to how the makeup-application process works, and how we should approach that overall. Putting on makeup is exhausting\u2014I think we just need to be real. ... And then, you want to pile on the layer of being a parent, or the layers of the 9-to-5, or all of the other different obligations that we have as individuals ... And I think that was a big component to me: How do I make this easier for myself? How can I make it through my day without having to be completely flatlined by the makeup-application process?\n\nIt was an instinct that paid off. In six short years, the CEO has guided the brand from a solo venture to a staff of 30, and from lips to full-face glamour. Her Flour setting powders offer the same all-day dependability as her lip colors, and a line of concealers are on deck for 2018. Meanwhile, her eye shadow palettes fly off the shelves of both her online and San Diego Beauty Bakerie boutiques\u2014especially her \u201cCoffee & Cocoa\u201d palette, created for her teenage daughter and emblazoned with her personal and professional motto: \u201cBetter, not bitter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough successful, the past six years have been bittersweet for Cashmere Nicole. Soon after launching Beauty Bakerie in 2011 at the age of 27, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, a recurring prognosis that would eventually require a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. Now 33, she remains optimistic and forward-thinking:\n\nYou know, I often tell people that I\u2019m living in my afterlife, after just going through maybe 10 years of feeling as though a lot of things weren\u2019t working out the way that I would want them to; just setback after setback. So, I think in that process you become a bit conditioned to say, \u201cI\u2019ve got to expect the worst but hope for the best.\u201d And in hindsight, I don\u2019t particularly like that way of thinking. It worked for me at that time, but after going through a life-changing experience with cancer and looking back now, I would say that it\u2019s just better to focus on the things that are working for you\u2014the things that you know you can do for sure\u2014and do away with things that you can\u2019t change.\n\nAnd she\u2019s definitely changing the makeup game. In her own evolution from a teenage mother putting herself through nursing school to socking away every spare dollar to start Beauty Bakerie, and recently garnering a $3 million seed investment from Unilever Ventures, Cashmere Nicole is redefining what a beauty mogul looks like. And while she\u2019s a self-confessed \u201cserial entrepreneur from the age of 12,\u201d she admits that she\u2019s learning as she grows her business:\n\nI think I am pretty tough, just based on feedback from some of the people around me, but sometimes I even question that. So, I think you have to have a delicate balance of knowing when to be sugar and when to be shit, a little. And I think I\u2019m still learning how to balance both of them; and [that\u2019s] the tough part about being a CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith pending expansion into retailers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Beauty Bakerie\u2019s growing international presence on home-shopping giant QVC, and a daughter heading off to college soon, it looks like Nicole\u2019s balancing act is going to get quite a workout. But she\u2019s more than up to the challenge:\n\nYou know, walking out of a doctor\u2019s office and being told you have cancer; you can cry, but what do you do? Go dig a grave for yourself and lay in it? I mean, you have to keep going; and that applies to everything. ... My best advice for staying power is that when the whole world and all of your friends might tell you that the easiest thing is to turn around and go back, you should do the exact opposite. You should keep going forward, because in that walk and in that journey of staying, you do become powerful, and you become stronger. And you will fall, and you will hurt yourself, and you will cry. But as long as you get back up and keep going, that is where you\u2019ll be made.", "keywords": ["survival", "built", "shes", "talks", "beauty", "things", "bakerie", "staying", "building", "tough", "think", "makeup", "cashmere", "nicole", "maven", "going", "indelible", "success"], "polarity": 0.09642857142857143, "subjectivity": 0.46062925170068025},

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for. The woman who, no matter what she\u2019s been through, puts on the clothes with her head held high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat beautiful black girls might we expect to see high-stepping on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this season?\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of casting, so no spoilers!\u201d he says. \u201cEach season, we prioritize diversity in our runway casting and do our best to represent the Brandon Maxwell woman: strong, sophisticated and confident.\u201d\n\nYou can trust that The Glow Up will be there to see our beautiful queens serve the people in the next chapter of his fashion fairy tale.", "keywords": ["model", "video", "brandon", "love", "times", "campaign", "blackgirlmagic", "believes", "charm", "maxwell", "designer", "smalls", "3rd", "maxwells", "fashion", "riley", "models"], "polarity": 0.27941388373531234, "subjectivity": 0.556208410636982},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

She\u2019s the CEO of Lauren Napier, maker of a single product: a luxury makeup-remover wipe. Her corporate values are triple mint, even by the most conscious of consumer standards. Her 4-year-old company is not only black-owned; it\u2019s 100 percent operated by women. And her formula is eco-friendly on every level, with no animal testing and no toxic ingredients, and it\u2019s entirely made in America. Cue the chorus of \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman.\u201d\n\nI met Napier three years ago, when she approached me on the street outside the Makeup Show in New York City. I thought she was going to ask me for modeling tips, but it was she who schooled me in the \u201cthe beauty of taking it all off.\u201d She placed a simple, black foil packet in my palm with her name written on it, smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Lauren. This is the best way to cleanse your skin.\u201d She then hailed a cab and disappeared. The impression she left stayed with me\u2014I knew she\u2019d be one to watch.\n\nI tossed the packet into my bag and retrieved it a few days later, to remove heavy on-camera makeup. The wipes came in two formulations: Cleanse, for normal skin, and Flaunt, for mature and sensitive skin types. They felt great\u2014soft like a chamois cloth\u2014while the formula had a serumlike texture. Most important, they did the cleanup job in one go, without leaving my face feeling stripped. Definitely an exceptional product in a beautiful package.\n\nBut as lovely as the experience of using them had been, I wondered: Would they catch on? As opposed to a basic drugstore brand, which averages $8 for a 25-count packet, Napier\u2019s price tag is a hefty $20 for 15 wipes. I\u2019d get my answer a few short months later, in the form of an email from luxury retailer Net-a-Porter: Napier\u2019s wipes had been added to its roster of prestige products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNapier, with a background as a film-and-television makeup artist, traces her accomplishments to her grandparents\u2014and their parents.\n\n\u201cAll four of my great-grandparents were entrepreneurs,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was huge in the black community at that time in the South.

King used to come through and perform and dine.\u201d\n\nHer paternal grandfather had a farm and a mortuary. \u201cThe spirit of being creative and proactive lives within me,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCall it desperation or inspiration, but it struck Napier on a flight from Australia to Dubai, when she found her cleansing wipes dried out and her facial mist spilled in her bag, leaving her in a full face of makeup on a long-haul flight.\n\nArriving in Dubai, she couldn\u2019t find a convenient, effective, yet restorative wipe to cleanse her face. Napier suddenly saw a white space in the crowded and competitive luxury-cosmetics market. \u201cWomen spend a lot of time and effort on prestige makeup, and you want the same quality of experience when you\u2019re taking your makeup off, as well,\u201d she says.\n\nNapier called it. The market was ready for her product.\n\nAlong with entrepreneurship, glamour is in Napier\u2019s blood. Growing up between Las Vegas and Texas, Napier drew equal inspiration from the showgirls on the Vegas Strip and Ann Richards, then the governor of Texas. \u201cShe had that Southern-belle charm. Southern gusto. You always knew who she was,\u201d Napier says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a go-getter who gets it done her way is in her blood, too. It\u2019s a spirit that informs everything behind her brand.\n\n\u201cI felt like if I was going to put my name on a product, it had to have the same kind of integrity that I carry myself with in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially in these times, it\u2019s important that underserved communities are being employed. I was heavily influenced by Obama\u2019s administration to make a positive impact, socially and environmentally.\u201d\n\nPutting that influence into action, Napier uses solar-powered manufacturing facilities owned by a Chinese-American female immigrant. During our interview, Napier is speaking from the floor of the co-packing company she uses, specifically chosen because it employs \u201chandi-capable\u201d workers, who are either mentally or physically impaired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose are two communities who are often overlooked or underserved, and I wanted to make sure they were included,\u201d she says. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to be a huge brand one day. Doing good is a big part of my story.\u201d\n\nNapier\u2019s ideas and inspiration weren\u2019t backed up by formal business training or an angel investor. In fact, her dream literally almost went up in smoke before she even began.\n\nKnowing that she wanted to create some kind of beauty business, Napier had adhered to a strict financial plan to clean up her credit from college loans. And then, close to meeting her startup goal, her house burned down\u2014and her insurance company refused her a payout. Recovery took another seven years, and finally saving $4,000, which she combined with a tax refund and an American Express card that \u201cmade things happen a lot faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNapier says, \u201cI never let the fact that I have no formal business education scare me.\u201d Her antidote to fear? \u201cPick up the phone and ask questions. I don\u2019t fear rejection.\u201d\n\nIt shows: Napier does all her own marketing and press, landing herself in both the storied pages of Vogue and the hallowed halls of Net-a-Porter, which she initially tagged on Instagram. \u201cI just had to be there,\u201d she says. Then comes a somewhat stunning revelation from a woman who seems\u2014well, so naturally perfect:\n\n\u201cBeing bullied made me fearless,\u201d she shares. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. I always encourage people who are going through it to look inside and find themselves. I\u2019m the same person now; I just look different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer voice becomes supercharged with a kind of elegant authority: \u201cAnd one day, I won\u2019t look like this, either; but I\u2019ll still have the same wisdom and personality.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for Lauren Napier? \u201c J. Crew just put me in the store for their holiday beauty collection,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m right at the register.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Napier\u2019s capable hands, the business built on taking it all off is definitely taking off:\n\n\u201cBeing in business is like wearing a heart monitor: You\u2019re up, and then your down. The only thing you never want is for your heart to stop.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Treat yourself\u2014or someone who deserves a skin splurge\u2014to the gift of Lauren Napier.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["hiring", "simply", "designers", "missing", "industry", "black", "designer", "talent", "chasemarshall", "fashion", "problem", "action"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

Instead, the woman was reassigned to a different position, and Strider was allowed to stay on the job after going through counseling. (The counseling apparently didn\u2019t stick. Five years later, Strider was fired from his role as the head of the pro-Clinton organization Correct the Record for, among other issues, harassing yet another young woman.)\n\nClinton has stayed relatively silent as the #MeToo movement has gained momentum, though she did issue a condemnation of Harvey Weinstein days after the story broke in which she claims she was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the revelations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a November 1, 2017 interview with the Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah during which Noah pressed her about her thoughts on workplace sexual harassment and abuses of power, she stated: \u201cThis is a pervasive problem that has to be dealt with, and more women have to be given the support they need, that they can come forward.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe continued: \u201cI\u2019ve talked to some of these young women over the years who have been facing these kinds of difficult choices.

This, despite her appearance as Lourdes \u201cLuLu\u201d Blackmon in Netflix\u2019s recent series reboot of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It; a scene-stealing supporting role that has literally sent Hollywood calling (as evidenced by the feature-film audition she\u2019d sent off just prior to our conversation).\n\nPersonally asked to audition by Lee himself after attending an open studio event at 40 Acres and a Mule, Benitez took a chance and went for it, attending a series of castings and screen tests before landing the role of Lourdes, Mars Blackmon\u2019s Santeria-practicing sister. (Fun fact: Hamilton alum Anthony Ramos was the first cast, as a now Puerto Rican Mars.) On-screen, Benitez was a natural, radiating equal parts high-strung Brooklyn Boricua and shamanic grace in her acting debut.\n\nBut Benitez\u2019s first on-screen experience was a bit more spontaneous as she juggled both a blind date and a mystery basket on Food Network\u2019s hit show Chopped\u2014and walked away with the win.\n\nThe chef\u2014who holds diplomas in both culinary and culinary management from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City\u2014initially found her calling while stationed in Germany with the Air Force, having also grown up an Air Force \u201cbrat,\u201d born in England and raised in California, Panama, Texas, Turkey and Washington, D.C., before starting her own military career.\n\nAnd, like the military, cooking is in her blood:\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve always been into cooking; my mom\u2019s a bomb cook, her mother is ... food has always been a big part of my life. But moving [to Germany] and living 30 minutes from the French border, going to get wine and cheese and all kinds of foods from different markets, that made me think about food in a more gourmet sense. ... I grew up always eating really good food, but living there put me in the mind frame of elevated food: the presentation, the markets and the whole culture around food there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, she\u2019d intended to channel that passion into food writing, starting a Tumblr in 2010 called I\u2019ll Cook Like Your Mother, the title inspired by a Badu lyric. Today, I\u2019ll Cook Like Your Mother is a full-fledged business and blog, offering catering, events and culinary education from Chef Santana herself. A scroll through her food gallery is a seriously sensual experience; and while Benitez is well-versed in a variety of cuisines, when asked for her favorite, her response was just as sexy: \u201cI really like Asian flavors\u2014I like the umami: that tart, that sweet, that spicy that Asian food brings.\u201d\n\nOn the day of our interview, Benitez stuffed 200 empanadas for a nonprofit organization empowering women, a service she happily renders whenever a cause resonates with her. But left to her own devices\u2014or in collaboration with fellow chef and friend Jade Verette as newly minted culinary team For the Culture Catering\u2014she likes \u201clots of colors, lots of flavor, and just, you know ... fun shit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer heritage is equally colorful, as the third of four daughters of a black-and-Italian mother and Puerto Rican father raised in nearby St. Croix. For her, it\u2019s a type of mixed heritage that too often goes ignored:\n\nWhen people think of \u2018mixed\u2019 [people], a lot of times, their heads just go to half-white, half-black. As a mixed woman, I don\u2019t relate to [that], because my family\u2014on both sides\u2014are black ... and it\u2019s like, the culture is different, but the same. I don\u2019t have a \u2018white side\u2019 of my family; it\u2019s just different brands of black, on both sides.\n\nWhen she is asked what her \u201cblack on both sides\u201d holiday will look like this year, Benitez\u2019s answer is delicious: \u201cIt looks like a lot of coquito, pastelillos, roast pernil [pork shoulder], arroz con gandules, prime rib, ham, greens, mac and cheese. ... It\u2019s all just one big, beautiful mesh of good-ass food.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHell, yeah.

It is a dangerous, albeit relatable, thought for many people who have experienced romantic love. Although I will not commit this thought to action, it tells me that toxic things are taking place in both my environment and the dynamic of my relationship. Thoughts are intangible, but they are far from inconsequential. It is thoughts that create presidencies and sustain toxic cultures.\n\nKeith Boykin recently wrote an article titled \u201cIn Defense of Lust\u201d as a response to an article by writer Darnell Moore titled \u201cThe Bodies of Others Are Not Mine.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote poetically about fundamental feminist truths around queer men and our objectification of one another. Moore interrogates his own habits when interacting with other men and invites gay men to do the same for themselves. The idea of his essay was to push and queer the conversation around rape culture past the heteronormative lens through which we\u2019ve been looking at it ever since the Hollywood sex scandals around Harvey Weinstein penetrated the public consciousness.\n\nBoykin\u2019s article challenges Moore\u2019s and states the case that thoughts can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be policed\u2014that as long as no action is being committed, there is no offense to apologize for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a post-The Secret world, it was surprising to read words, especially from a writer, that attempted to declaw the power of thought. Boykin writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental distinction between thought and behavior, and this is what concerns me most about policing our imagination. Sexual misconduct is a serious societal problem that deserves the attention of men of all sexual orientations, but in our effort to eradicate sexual assault and rape culture, we need not rid ourselves of desire and lust.\u201d\n\nThought and behavior do not live separately; in fact, they depend on each other. Thoughts create behavior. And behaviors, practiced enough, create environments and culture.\n\nInside of spaces for queer men, patriarchal thoughts are accepted\u2014thoughts like the fantasies void of consent, like what Boykins wrote about Moore: \u201cI turn him toward the tree and enter him from behind, holding his neck down for balance and dominance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just a fantasy detailing an erotic wish; this is a fantasy detailing assault\u2014shared publicly with an alarming lack of awareness of how its publishing alone could make its subject uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nPatriarchal behavior is constantly excused and often fetishized. There are countless articles demonstrating how stereotypical toxic masculine behavior, which includes everything from exhibiting violent behaviors when mad to touching people with no consent, is preferred by a large portion of gay men. Because of this, a patriarchal culture and environment are created. And one of the symptoms of this patriarchal environment is rape culture. This is the culture that made Boykin think that expressing his more-toxic fantasies was a just rebuttal to an article about queerness and objectification.\n\nMy second thought when reading Boykin\u2019s article was how people\u2014especially those who claim a radical queer or gay politic\u2014must elevate the conversation around desire, lust and the erotic. Whom you lust over and how you lust and how you express desire for another man is not created in a vacuum; it is informed by everything you\u2019ve experienced up until that lustful moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Moore was pushing us to think about with his article is what informs these \u201crandom\u201d moments of dehumanizing someone who has the same gender, sexuality and race experience as oneself.\n\nMoments where black men can\u2019t engage with other black men beyond their body, face or sexuality disturb me because it reminds me of the narrative of black men\u2019s history in America. It reminds me that even between two black men, the physical appraisal of someone takes priority over a type of intellectual or nonsexual emotional engagement with each other.\n\nIt reminds me of the auction block, where black people were mules being looked over. It reminds me of the rape and castration of black men and the narrative that the sum of black men\u2019s worth is in their sexuality, their labor and their usefulness inside of the white supremacist patriarchy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, your wet dream fantasy is not harmless. It strips black men of humanity and instead demonizes and eroticizes them beyond recognition.\n\nFinally, there was a total lack of any kind of analysis on power. As I read the cases against Harvey Weinstein as well as Bill Cosby, one common thread I found was their power to change environments\u2014to turn professional spaces into sexual ones. To transform friendly outings into dangerous, predatory moments.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that before a Cosby places a drug inside a martini, or before a Weinstein pulls his dick out of his pants, a sexual, erotic fantasy often occurs that involves the rapist in power and the victim submitting. They act on that fantasy and quickly change the environment from a safe moment to a dangerous, predatory moment. One\u2019s ability to do that as a man still exists, even if the one being pursued is another man. That is something to agitate, interrogate and\u2014perhaps\u2014even police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven inside my own experiences with rape, sexual assault, harassment and molestation, it is clear that the untamed male imagination is what activated those violent moments in my life. I know transgender people who were killed because of a cisgender man\u2019s untamed imagination and his shame around it. From experience, I have undergone rape and assault because of closeted, masculine men\u2019s untamed imaginations.\n\nThe imagination is something to take seriously. Writers and intellectuals especially should know this, since so much of our work is rooted in the imagination and our ability to capture that of the public.\n\nMy boyfriend is alive, but in those toxic moments when I thought about harm and violence, I thought about what else was lurking. I found that a struggle for power and an insecurity informed by patriarchal standards lived in our relationship dynamic, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a way, Boykin is correct: Thoughts and the imagination are not things to be policed, but they are something to be examined, and in some cases, they hold hints to where the soul needs healing.

Over salads and crab cakes (we split the fries), Akkad recounts her student days in Egypt.\n\n\u201cEgypt wasn\u2019t conservative at all at that time; women were in Western dress, and the caf\u00e9 at the American University was the big expat hangout for students and diplomatic hopefuls like myself,\u201d she says, adding a caveat that adds significant intrigue. \u201cEvery spy in the world was crawling the campus and lounging in the caf\u00e9 looking for recruits.\u201d\n\nThe American University Caf\u00e9 was also where Susan spied the love of her life: fellow student and theater major Ahmed Akkad. The two have now been married for over 30 years.\n\nEgypt is also where she began what would become a lifelong love affair with beauty and fragrance. In the age of the pharaohs, men and women alike wore statement eyeliner and fabulous wigs; to this day, fragrance in Egypt remains a daily multilayered ritual where everything from hair to furniture is perfumed like the wearer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrushing aside dreams of a diplomatic career, Susan relocated with her new husband to New York, where they placed their priorities on making a living\u2014no obvious feat, with two very esoteric degrees (his is in comparative literature and theater). While Ahmed launched a fashion line, Susan found a job as assistant to the sportswear editor at American Vogue, which paid $15,000 a year in 1986. In need of more money, she quickly moved on to a (slightly) better-paying job as a public relations assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder. Starting salary? $16,000.\n\nLanding a job in beauty after dreams of a diplomatic career may seem odd, but in the buttoned-up multinational corporate world of luxury beauty, it was once de rigueur to hire the wives of State Department officials in public relations and similar roles in international business. Their experience organizing official dinners, navigating the social and international worlds, and connections to wealthy society made them the organic influencers of that time.\n\nAs an entry-level assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder, Susan was allowed the chance to watch and learn from all departments. She laughs as she recalls getting dry-cleaning and throwing birthday parties for a boss\u2019s cat as part of her duties. What she learned was what it takes to work every rung of the corporate ladder; but most important, she learned that she loved the beauty biz\u2014especially fragrance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ahmed\u2019s fashion line took off as a global luxury brand, Susan left the corporate world to work in her husband\u2019s company. In 1995, Ahmed sold the fashion brand to his manufacturers to start interiors, accessories and other businesses. Susan was now unemployed, and through some recommendations from friends, she found her way to Lanc\u00f4me as director of fragrance.\n\nSusan Akkad was soon recruited back to Est\u00e9e Lauder, where she served in various global marketing positions for almost 10 years before being installed in her current post as senior VP of local and cultural innovation, responsible for multiethnic innovation. What exactly does multicultural innovation entail? In this role, Akkad partners with the many brands under Est\u00e9e Lauder to advise on multicultural strategy and the best ways to tailor products and communication to be more meaningful to women of color.\n\nHer post at Lauder affords her a global view of the beauty of black and brown women, who, she tells me, are more confident about their looks than their white counterparts. As a culture, we black women historically have primarily based our self-esteem surrounding our looks on the opinions within our community, rather than on mainstream media standards. Akkad recounts being asked why certain products advertised as corrective were not appealing to black women. To which she would answer, that\u2019s because \u201cwhen you market a product to black women as if there is something wrong with them that needs fixing, black women simply don\u2019t relate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking me straight in the eye, Akkad lightly brushes back one of her naturally ink-black curls and straightens the peaked lapel of her black Junya Watanabe tuxedo suit. She tells me matter-of-factly, \u201cMarketing is diplomacy.\u201d", "keywords": ["women", "beauty", "akkad", "multiculturaland", "fixed", "dont", "making", "black", "american", "knows", "est\u00e9e", "lauder", "fashion", "susan", "innovation", "need"], "polarity": 0.12378940503940505, "subjectivity": 0.3435481185481185},

For me, that word defines Serena Williams. I love her body\u2014it\u2019s invincible. I also love that none of her seemingly superhuman attributes were given to her or easily attained. Everything she has, she earned, one drop of sweat at a time. She and big sister Venus were their own mini-civil-rights movement as they fought to establish their place on the predominantly white tennis circuit, and they have dominated for nearly two decades.\n\nBecoming the mother to gorgeous baby girl Alexis Olympia\u2014who shares her February cover of Vogue magazine\u2014was no less a struggle than any of Williams\u2019 other feats; she came straight out of Compton, Calif., to be crowned the Best Athlete of All Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs told to Vogue, Williams\u2014newly married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2014was blessed with an easy pregnancy (as expected, given her supreme physical condition). But delivering the other cover girl on this month\u2019s Vogue was ultimately a \u201charrowing experience.\u201d Call it bad luck, but as her baby\u2019s heart rate plummeted dangerously low during birth, Williams required an emergency cesarean section.\n\nTo make matters worse, the new mother suffered a recurrence of blood clots\u2014a condition that flared up hours after the C-section that left Williams gasping for air and fearing that she was having another pulmonary embolism. After she advocated for herself and insisted on a CT scan and a blood thinner, another emergency surgery was performed to insert a filter into a major vein to clear up abdominal bleeding (a side effect of blood-thinning medication). To add to the drama, her C-section incision then ruptured because of the intense coughing caused by the blood clot. Our mighty Serena was left flat on her back for a full six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, mother and daughter are now more than fine. Serena is up and naturally winning again, with a new clothing line launching on her website in March, serial investments in tech companies owned or led by black women, and a new home in Silicon Valley.\n\nIs she done with tennis? Not by a long shot. Twenty-three grand slams already have her name on them, and she\u2019s looking to own 25 in total, making her the greatest tennis player of all time (24 is the current record held by Australian Margaret Court).\n\nAs for motherhood, Williams only believes it ups her game, telling Vogue:\n\nKnowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match. I don\u2019t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s a different feeling for me ... It\u2019s interesting. ... There hasn\u2019t been a clear number one since I was there. It will be cool to see if I get there again, to what I call my spot\u2014where I feel I belong. I don\u2019t play to be the second best or the third best. If there\u2019s no clear number one, it\u2019s like, yeah, I can get my spot back. But if there is a clear number one, that\u2019s cool, too, because it\u2019s like, yeah, I\u2019m gonna come for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for introducing her daughter to Mom\u2019s stratospheric fame, Williams told Vogue that she wants baby Alexis to know that her own potential is absolutely limitless:", "keywords": ["mother", "olympia", "love", "blood", "williams", "baby", "cover", "tennis", "dont", "number", "slamming", "best", "vogue", "clear", "alexis", "serena", "beautiful"], "polarity": 0.2093217329545454, "subjectivity": 0.5015337527056276},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

The soft-scented cure for all things ashy popped on the scene, and black girls immediately fell in love with its line of hair-care products that let us love on our natural hair at an affordable price. It was easily accessible. It had different product lines containing different essential oils. Black girls talked it up and helped it grow into an empire.\n\nAnd how did it repay black girls?\n\nBy making a commercial about how hard it is to be accepted with your natural hair and centering white women in that narrative.\n\nAs if.\n\nSheaMoisture got canceled faster than a show starring Taye Diggs.\n\nYou took a huge L, SheaMoisture. I hope those white women were worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Dove and SheaMoisture are now under the same corporate umbrella. Dove caught the ire of black women and social media in general a few months ago when it dropped an ad on its Facebook page that featured a darker-skinned black woman turning into a white woman\u2014literally.\n\nThe black woman was wearing a T-shirt that matched her skin color. She lifts the shirt over her head to reveal a white woman in a cream-colored shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad hit a sore spot for black people. For years, soap companies advertised their products as being able to wash the black off of people. No one could understand what Dove\u2019s motives were for creating such an ad.\n\nThe company tried to explain, but the damage had already been done.\n\nShame on you, Dove. Next time, consult actual people of color before trying to make an ad that is supposed to appeal to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nRemember when we heard Nicki on Roman\u2019s Revenge and Kanye\u2019s Monster and thought she was going to be everything we wanted to represent the ladies in hip-hop? Those sure were the days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToo bad she came into 2017 and started the year off immediately taking an L when Remy Ma slaughtered her with ShETHER. That was seemingly the harbinger of doom for Nicki, who continued on the path of WTF? with a detour onto that questionable Paper magazine cover and culminating in her ultimately being bested at her own game by the one and only Cardi B.\n\nRumor has it that when both women appeared on the Migos hit Motorsport, Nicki changed her verse after she heard Cardi\u2019s. Oops.\n\nMaybe 2018 will be a better year for the rap Barbie, but we won\u2019t hold our breath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmarosa\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman really did black people many injustices this year. How do you allow yourself to be trotted out as the token darkie in the Donald Trump White House? How do you do absolutely nothing to foster better relationships between that man in the Oval Office and black people in America\u2014especially when your job description says that is what you are supposed to do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut instead of doing that, Omarosa turned the White House into a photoshoot location for her wedding, showed her ass at the NABJ convention, hosted her wedding at a Trump hotel, got on national TV and proclaimed that Trump is not a racist, he\u2019s just racial\u2014and, after all that ass-kissing and tap dancing, still got fired from her job as token White House darkie. For shame, Omarosa. For shame. Please take this L and disappear into obscurity. We don\u2019t need to hear from you ever again.\n\nShould We Delight in Omarosa\u2019s Demise?

You have to be pretty brazen and full of white-boy privilege to grab Terry Crews by the genitals, not knowing if he is going to beat the living shit out of you or not. You have to be a really shitty person to use your position of power to either convince or coerce someone into having a sexual relationship with you. You deserve to be in jail if you forced yourself on someone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese men have all been accused of various forms of sexual misconduct, sexual harassment and sexual assault. Some, like Kevin Spacey and Adam Venit, took their L and disappeared into obscurity\u2014likely hoping the whole thing would blow over.\n\nOthers, like Russell Simmons, turned completely gross about it, created a hashtag meant to derail a hashtag movement for real victims and claimed that they were going to prove their accusers were liars\u2014only to fall silent anyway because, guess what? You are probably guilty of what the victims said in the first place.\n\nShame on these guys, and fuck them, too.

Ayana Smith\u2019s goal with her new line of statement tees was not to make a statement at all but, rather, to issue a call to action, to incite and inspire conversation on topics that can be hard to talk about in mixed company.\n\nSpeaking of mixed company: that interracial dinner for 50 she was talking about? It happened\u2014debatably by design or accident\u2014when she volunteered her home to host whoever signed up through Day of Dinners, a national charity with partners as diverse as Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Black Lives Matter and the ACLU. The topic Smith chose for discussion was \u201cBridging the Gap Between East and West of the River.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith counts herself as not only a resident but also an advocate for education and economic development in D.C.\u2019s Ward 7. Smith\u2019s neighborhood, where she lives with her husband and two kids, is an area known for the highest levels of poverty and reported crime east of the Anacostia River. Even though the Smiths\u2019 Escape Lounge is located on a trendy street west of the river, Ayana Smith chose to open their home on the economically challenged East Side because she \u201cwanted to showcase all the good that\u2019s happening here east of the river.\u201d\n\nLooking back on the dinner and her chosen topic, Smith tells me, \u201cWe never even got to the topic.\u201d The people who showed up were predominantly white, and Smith says she was shocked by how much they cared and wanted to talk about issues that affect the black community. After that first gathering in July, she began having regular #AskMe group dinners to further the dialogue. The resulting conversations prompted the concept for the tees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explains: \u201cHearing \u2018That\u2019s not a community you want to go into unless you\u2019re looking to get shot\u2019 is a [common warning] that white people in our #AskMe group encountered when they shared that they were coming to my home. We help each other understand ways to deal with and how to respond to questions about race that can be awkward to approach or difficult to answer.\u201d\n\n#AskMeTees was born out of that personal frustration; not only from assumptions made about her neighborhood but from other offenses\u2014like strangers walking up to her kids and touching their hair. As Smith recounts, \u201cMost other people are teaching their kids not to let strangers touch them, so why do you think it\u2019s OK to walk up and start touching my kids?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the impetus behind the \u201c#AskMe Why You Can\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d shirt. \u201cLiving while black\u201d was another motivator for launching this T-shirt line\u2014only 10 days old as of press time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume anything about me,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAsk me!\u201d\n\nFor instance, Smith hates rings and doesn\u2019t wear a wedding ring. Because of that, \u201cpeople assume that my kids don\u2019t have a father.\u201d Yet, to the contrary, they have two excellent and deeply involved parents.\n\n\u201cI think people are often afraid to be on the wrong side of an issue, and so they stay quiet around family and colleagues, but the conversations people might possibly have with strangers can be a lot more candid,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#AskMe T-shirts come with rules, Smith asserts, talking a mile a minute: \u201cYou better wear your #AskMe tee on the day when you\u2019re in the mood to talk and educate people in meaningful conversation.\u201d\n\nAn entrepreneur at heart\u2014Smith is currently developing an app for an in-home play version of the Escape Lounge\u2014and a member of Black Female Founders, she printed the words \u201c#AskMe About My Start-Up\u201d to encourage entrepreneurs to practice their pitch as much as possible. That said, Smith doesn\u2019t expect open congress to break out on the streets for everyone wearing one of her tees.\n\nBut she\u2019s hoping that if you catch the right conversation on the right day, the messages will plant a seed and bear the fruit of healthy, respectful debate\u2014and maybe even sprout a money tree.", "keywords": ["chest", "talking", "strangers", "talk", "white", "east", "say", "askme", "black", "tees", "day", "topic", "kids", "smith"], "polarity": 0.07740278727120832, "subjectivity": 0.50589877958299},

Vogue has called her \u201cthe most influential makeup artist in the world,\u201d and there\u2019s not a face that has graced its covers that she hasn\u2019t made blossom with her particular brand of magic\u2014as demonstrated on beauties like Naomi Campbell, Joan Smalls, Duckie Thot and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBoth Fortune 500 companies and fans from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro clamor for McGrath\u2019s services for fashion shoots and product-development consultations. In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows.

So here\u2019s my advice on how to get yours: Log on to Sephora.com at 12 p.m. EST on Jan. 18; on Jan. 19, you can head to select Sephora stores. McGrath has timed the release of these shades so that her fans can use the same makeup she\u2019ll be using during February\u2019s Milan Fashion Week. She\u2019s also in keeping with the latest retail trend of \u201cbuy now, wear now\u201d\u2014but only if you can get it!", "keywords": ["mother", "eye", "soon", "pat", "artist", "come", "beauty", "mcgrath", "shadow", "makeup", "fashion", "jan", "services", "mogul"], "polarity": 0.18513162234590808, "subjectivity": 0.4745823541537827},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

This is a noble cause that all mankind must take up. We all know this. Or at least we should. But somehow whiteness always finds a will and a way to muddy the waters. Just look at how many of them voted Toup\u00e8 Fiasco into office. Look, white-cis-hetero women experience gender inequality differently than their counterparts of color in the Western world. This is no longer up for debate! Sure, we\u2019ve all heard the statistical data about the pay discrepancy in Hollywood and Natalie Portman reportedly earned three times less than her male costar in some crappy movie nobody saw. But I bet Portman and her agents would scoff at the prospect of signing the kind of deal most black actresses make per project. Even when we\u2019re the damn stars!\n\nOutside of Hollywood, the wage gap is still stacked in favor or white and white-passing women. While they make $0.82 to the white male dollar, black women earn only $0.65 and Latinas are taking home a measly $0.58 to the dollar for the same work of their white male counterparts*. So yes, life for white women ain't been no crystal stair, but to disregard the additional hurdles that women of color face every day is wrong-headed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, of course, brings us to the recent back-and-forth between Shirley MacLaine, Salma Hayek and former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams (and star of the upcoming \u201cThe Incredible Jessica James\u201d with Atlanta\u2019s LaKeith Stanfield). They were guests at a recent Sundance luncheon where women in entertainment, including Alfre Woodard, Dakota Fanning and Kimberly Pierce, were invited to break bread and discuss female empowerment in the male-dominated film industry. You can read the full transcript here. Go ahead, I\u2019ll wait. I\u2019ll just be over here punching the air like Cuba Gooding the Jr. in Boyz n the Hood and fighting back the urge to cuss out the first white lady in a pink knit hat that I see.\n\nYou back?\n\nYou mad? Good, me too. I almost expect white women, especially white women of a certain age, to not fully understand the importance of recognizing and acknowledging intersectionality when tackling sexism. I don\u2019t give ladies from Gloria Steinem\u2019s generation a pass but we\u2019ve come a long way baby like them slim-ass cigarettes and sometimes old habits die hard. Ms. Hayek\u2019s ass, though?! Nawl, bonita. I would think you\u2019d know better but just like you should have known better than to do Grown Ups (and Grown Ups 2, what does Adam Sandler have on you?) I guess you missed the memo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat especially irked me, however, was what MacLaine fixed her mouth to say to Williams:\n\n\u201cChange your point of view of being victimized. I\u2019m saying: Find the democracy inside.\u201c\n\nFirst. Of. All. When some of your mammas were burning bras and rallying for sexual freedom, women of color were fighting against that plus the over-sexualization and subjugation of our black and brown bodies plus a whole slew of racist and race-related fuckshit. A subjugation created by the very white supremacist, capitalistic system that men who share the same skin-tone as you created. And if it wasn\u2019t for our bodies being used, abused, sterilized and mutilated in the name of gynecological research you wouldn\u2019t have anything to access in the first place. You\u2019re welcome, by the way!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile your grandmothers and great-grandmothers were getting their sister suffragette on and demanding they be allowed to step outside of the kitchen and work for a living, our grandmothers and great-grandmothers were already working. Sometimes two jobs. They were cooking your meals and cleaning your homes and yes even wet-nursing your children so we\u2019ll be good and god-damned if we\u2019re gonna sit here and continue to placate your lilly-white sensibilities while you again attempt to speak over women of color. Especially trans women of color who face each day with their very bodies in mortal danger just for having the audacity to be alive.\n\nI\u2019m sure (by all reports) that Williams was uncomfortable confronting these two veterans of the screen and stage. I would have been. I read her measured replies and understood the delicate act she was forced to play. To not come across too impassioned lest she be labeled just another angry black woman. I silently cheered her on reading as she further articulated her points about her black identity not being something she can just \u201covercome\u201d or remove like the latest fashion. Hayek, betraying everything Frida taught her about solidarity, missed yet another opportunity to catch the knowledge Williams was breaking down. \u201cThen that\u2019s your journey. But I want to inspire other people to know it\u2019s a choice,\u201d Hayek went on to say.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this sound like the cries of those who blame \u201cidentity politics\u201d for the ills of the land and not like actual bigotry? I lost track of the number of times I\u2018ve been asked to stand idly by or rather behind some black man and support our race while keeping my mouth shut about black women dying by their hands in domestic violence cases. If I were keeping track it would probably be equal to the amount of times I felt silenced by some white woman as she spoke over me and even for me, demanding to be the mouthpiece of the feminist movement. Why in 2017 should this even still be an issue? Why are women of color, especially black women, burdened with continuing to fight with and for people who won\u2019t fight for us? Who won\u2019t even listen to us?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe the myth of the angry black woman wouldn\u2019t be so persistent if we weren\u2019t constantly faced with this ignorance. It\u2019s tiring. But still we find a way to keep going in a world that tells us every day and in every way that our voices shouldn\u2019t carry. I salute you Jessica Williams for daring to speak on what we all know as black women. For having the strength to persevere in a land that seems to hate us from all sides and internalizing that strength and spinning it into black-gold magic.\n\nAnd because irony: \u201cCan I interrupt, because I feel misunderstood,\u201d Hayek later said.\n\nJordan Kauwling is an early thirties Philadelphian but she tells everyone she's in her late thirties because she doesn't understand how math works. When she's not busy writing, singing, eating all the falafel or unsuccessfully finishing another craft project you can catch her talking junk on Twitter.", "keywords": ["color", "woman", "women", "williams", "ive", "shirley", "white", "salma", "maclaine", "hayek", "black", "frustration", "especially", "jessica", "know", "way"], "polarity": 0.04593040621266426, "subjectivity": 0.41513056835637463},

Yes, I am a man, but like 2Chainz, I\u2019m different, so don\u2019t lump me in with these fools who continually give me the gender equivalent of white guilt. Fools like the ones profiled in this recent Associated Press piece entitled \u201cIn Wake of Weinstein, Men Wonder if Hugging Women Still OK.\u201d\n\n\n\nAre you finished rolling your eyes yet? If you\u2019re not, I understand. I\u2019m still rolling mine, too. The Associated Press quotes a man by the name of Steve Wyard who said he assumed that sexual harassment was merely \u201ca put-out-or-lose-your-job overture.\u201d However, in light of that blowhard Harvey Weinstein finally facing consequences for decades of alleged sexual predatory behavior, including harassment and assault, poor lil\u2019 slow-ass Steven says, \u201cNow he\u2019s not so sure.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHave we gotten to the point now where men can\u2019t say, \u2018That\u2019s a nice dress\u2019 or \u2018Did you do something with your hair?\u2019\u201d Steven\u2019s simple ass said. \u201cThe potential problem is you can\u2019t even feel safe saying, \u2018Good morning\u2019 anymore.\u201d\n\nI could quote more from the article, but why make anyone endure more idiocy? For the record, it was irresponsible to publish this without properly contextualizing what constitutes sexual harassment in the article. Likewise, while it does end with quotes from a female sociologist, it doesn\u2019t remove the stench of the dense men quoted throughout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s any lesson to be learned right now, it\u2019s that stupid men should have their mics turned off. Now\u2019s the time for them to listen rather than speak. Lending them a platform allows them the opportunity to further soil the conversation with their dimwitted bullshit.\n\n\n\nEnter Too $hort, who recently fell for the trap TMZ often lays for celebrities in desperate need of round-the-clock publicists.\n\nWhen asked to offer his advice on those men \u201cfalsely accused,\u201d Too $hort lamented that the \u201cart of trying to fuck is over.\u201d Why would the question be even framed that way? Spoiler: sexism and stupidity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, so what is $hort Dog\u2019s advice? \u201cYou just gotta kick back. Let\u2019s let the women do the approaching now. Only fuck the girls that want to fuck you.\u201d\n\nWhy do some men think women holding rapists, predators and sexual harassers accountable mean that courtship is officially over? Also, \u201conly fuck the girls that want to fuck you\u201d? Negro, that\u2019s called consent. It should always be that way. Then again, five years ago, Too $hort had to apologize for a video produced by XXL that featured the rapper instructing young boys how to coerce a girl into having sex, which both he and the publication ultimately had to apologize for.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToo $hort did acknowledge in the TMZ clip that men have been \u201cfucking up a lot\u201d and basically encouraged women to essentially run everything from politics to Hollywood to corporate America. That doesn\u2019t negate how nonsensical he sounds; nor does it absolve him or the interviewer for drowning in casual sexism. Not to mention, Too $hort sounds a bit disappointed that you just cannot whip out your dick at random around women anymore. Who birthed you people? Why do you think it\u2019s OK to just pull out your dick without an explicit invitation to? I want the men who do this to wake up dickless.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of wishes, I want the paparazzo who asked the question and filmed this nonsense to run near a wildfire, toss his equipment into it and go find something else to do with his life besides making the situation worse. As for $hort, I want him and other men to get over the reality that they have to treat women as people rather than sexual objects whose lone role is to satisfy their sexual appetites. I love \u201cBlow the Whistle,\u201d too, but you\u2019re over 50. C\u2019mon, nah. Grow up!\n\n\n\nNow, I also have heard women in daytime television\u2014OK, Wendy Williams\u2014say in jest that she\u2019s weary of the current wave and how it impacts the workplace, which is not exactly helpful. I\u2019ve seen similar critiques across social media, though. Hell, I\u2019ve suffered through barbershop conversations about this topic, too. Yes, I came in with the purest of intentions\u2014a bald fade\u2014and ended up being tortured for an hour of utter foolishness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between wondering if things will go too far and making the most out of the absolute least. In this case, women are not asking much. It\u2019s not that great an ask for women to want to be respected in the workplace. It\u2019s well within reason to ask men to keep their dicks in their pants; to keep their disgusting, unprofessional \u201cjokes\u201d to themselves; to respect women\u2019s autonomy; to not be rapists; to not commit sexual assault; to not sexually harass anyone; to tame their inner creep; to not be any other variation of a predator. That\u2019s not the same as being barred from a greeting or hugging someone\u2014well, if they want to be hugged. A lot of y\u2019all need to know, regardless of intent, that not everyone wants you to hug your ass.\n\n\n\nIf this lil\u2019 pep talk has not calmed your outrageous, inane and child-left-behind-sounding fears and you still find yourself as a man no longer feeling safe, congratulations; you know now what it\u2019s like to be a woman in the workplace.

While I\u2019m none too fond of female leaders being posited as the fallback plan for a dysfunctional patriarchy, rather than the highly qualified corrective measure, recent research\u2014including a Gallup poll\u2014seems to agree with our 44th president.\n\nAs reported by CNBC Make It., a recently updated 2012 study by leadership-development firm Zenger Folkman revealed that \u201cwomen scored higher than men in 13 out of the 16 leadership competencies Folkman\u2019s research measure for, tying only for their tendency to be innovative.\u201d\n\nAlso notable is that the study also considered women an \u201cuntapped resource,\u201d despite our prevalence in the workforce. Company president and psychometrician Joe Folkman explained that this could likely be an issue of confidence\u2014on the part of not just working women but also the companies that employ them.\n\n\u201cIn organizations where women don\u2019t feel like second-class citizens and they don\u2019t feel abused, they actually feel empowered. They feel like they\u2019re taken seriously and like they have a future there,\u201d Folkman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain: Ya think?\n\nWhile it\u2019s unknown whether the Zenger Folkman leadership research went further, polling the same categories along racial lines, it\u2019s worth considering that black women are currently the highest-educated group in the United States\u2014and are therefore presumably the most qualified for leadership positions. And yet a 2016 study produced by the American Association of University Women (pdf) indicates that black women occupy a mere 8 percent of private-sector jobs, and only 2 percent of leadership roles.\n\nSo while the leadership potential is there, it remains untapped.

A time like this calls for the insightful input of thoughtful, empathetic and measured thinkers to help steer the conversation in a constructive direction. Enter Lena Dunham: the antithesis of all of the above.\n\nArmed with an almost superhuman knack for saying all the wrong things at the worst possible times, and an obscenely misguided impression that the general public both desires and urgently needs her input, Dunham and her co-showrunner, Jenni Konner, decided to throw their hats in the ring by releasing a statement in support of longtime friend and Girls producer Murray Miller, who had been accused of raping actress Aurora Perrineau when she was 17:\n\nDuring the windfall of deeply necessary accusations over the last few months in Hollywood, we have been thrilled to see so many women\u2019s voices heard and dark experiences in this industry justified. It\u2019s a hugely important time of change and, like every feminist in Hollywood and beyond, we celebrate. But during every time of change there are also incidences of the culture, in its enthusiasm and zeal, taking down the wrong targets. We believe, having worked closely with him for more than half a decade, that this is the case with Murray Miller. While our first instinct is to listen to every woman\u2019s story, our insider knowledge of Murray\u2019s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year. It is a true shame to add to that number, as outside of Hollywood women still struggle to be believed. We stand by Murray and this is all we\u2019ll be saying about this issue.\n\nThe statement\u2014unsolicited, smacking of condescension, childish, impulsive, lacking in grace and self-awareness\u2014was quintessential Dunham. And in typical Dunham fashion, after receiving a barrage of backlash, about 24 hours later she quickly issued a public apology, chalking up her \u201cmisstep\u201d to the well-intentioned naivete of a 31-year-old woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the pushback she received was more than warranted and Dunham, per usual, serves as a perfect example of what not to do and say, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that her and Konner\u2019s reactions are not rare. Soon after Minnesota Sen. Al Franken came under fire for allegations of sexual misconduct, 36 women who worked on Saturday Night Live came out to defend Franken in a signed letter of solidarity for the show\u2019s onetime cast member and current Democratic politician.\n\nSaying they felt compelled to \u201cstand up for Franken,\u201d their letter stated in part: \u201cWe would like to acknowledge that not one of us ever experienced any inappropriate behavior; and mention our sincere appreciation that he treated us with the utmost respect and regard.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, actress Brigitte Nielsen, ex-wife of Sylvester Stallone, went on record to defend him against the accusation that he raped a then-16-year-old girl in 1986 on the set of the movie Over the Top. Speaking to TMZ, Nielsen claimed that the incident could not have occurred because she and Stallone were \u201cinseparable\u201d at the time and no one was in their hotel suite but them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more complicated facets of acknowledging the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and the overwhelming multitude of victims is coming to terms with the pervasiveness of sexual abusers and our likely social proximity to them. Current events no longer allow us to pretend that these men are fringe cretins who linger on the outskirts of society. They are our husbands, fathers, friends, co-workers, brothers, cousins, boyfriends, exes, uncles, esteemed mentors and companions.\n\nIf statistics are to be believed and every 98 seconds someone in the U.S. is being sexually assaulted, it stands to reason that this is a country rife with both victims and perpetrators alike. It\u2019s time to start grappling with the fact that some of the men in our lives\u2014yes, even the ones who are kind to us, the progressive allies, the ones we hold dear\u2014could be among them.\n\n\n\nUnderstandably, a lot of us want to believe the men we hold in high esteem are \u201cgood\u201d men. However \u201cgoodness\u201d is a useless, flimsy metric for human character. Since the dawn of time, \u201cgood\u201d people have always been capable of doing horrendous things at least once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, in an age when conversations about consent and sexual autonomy are more openly discussed and debated on social media platforms, many adult men are conceding to \u201cgrowth\u201d in understanding what can qualify as abuse or misconduct. It\u2019s fair to ask the question: What of the women they encountered before this era of social-media-driven progressiveness? \u201cGrowth\u201d does not happen in a vacuum, and it\u2019s time to admit that there is a high likelihood of victims left in the wake of their ascent to \u201cenlightenment.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven staunchly feminist women struggle with clinging to the useless ideal of goodness and have felt compelled to put their reputations and necks on the line to defend accused men who are prominent and important to their social circles. In 1998, Gloria Steinem (longtime friend and supporter of the Clintons) wrote \u201cFeminists and the Clinton Question,\u201d in which she cast doubt on the validity of several of Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual assault/harassment accusers, asserting that even if all the various allegations were true, Bill Clinton was simply \u201ca candidate for sex addiction therapy.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s easy to look at these women\u2019s actions, which seem to conflict with their publicly embraced social and political ideologies, and shake our heads in disgust (and, please, shake those heads\u2014it\u2019s disgusting), the larger question we probably need to confront is, \u201cHow would I react when/if it\u2019s my turn?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill we be compelled to rush to the front lines to offer our own personal anecdotes of exemplary behavior to combat sexual abuse allegations? When it\u2019s not just the creeps out there but the men in our own world, will we choose silence? Or will we vocally support the alleged victims, as is the case with the Beastie Boys\u2019 Adam Horovitz, who publicly stood with the nine women accusing his father, famed playwright Israel Horovitz, of sexual misconduct, with one of them alleging rape?\n\n\n\nThese are hard but important questions we must pose to ourselves during this serial outing of sexual predators. It\u2019s not enough to simply condemn abusers; we are also now called to push this conversation forward by examining our own behaviors that may inadvertently enable or protect them and to check our compulsion to believe anyone absolutely incapable of sexual misconduct simply because of how wonderful a person they are when they\u2019re in our company.\n\nSo feel free to grimace at the Dunhams and the Roy Moore defenders of the world because yes, they are a cringeworthy sight to behold. You may even consider yourself an ally to victims or be a survivor yourself; you might even parrot platitudes like \u201cBelieve women.\u201d But also be sure to look inward and ask yourself if you\u2019d apply that mantra to women whose accusations reach the men of your own threshold. You\u2019d be surprised what \u201cgood\u201d and well-meaning people are capable of when believing women becomes personally inconvenient.\n\n", "keywords": ["man", "accused", "hollywood", "women", "allegations", "react", "men", "dunham", "social", "yes", "misconduct", "victims", "care", "sexual", "know", "himtoo", "important"], "polarity": 0.18044470124978595, "subjectivity": 0.5777898843153082},

There are many women and men like my mother with successful side hustles, who lack access to support networks, educational resources or capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThrough Rising Tide we offer programs such as our Community Business Academy, Business Acceleration Services, Credit to Capital and the Start Something Challenge to help people, like my mother, gain the tools they need to transform their side businesses into sustainable and profitable ventures,\u201d she says.\n\nSo why New Jersey?\n\n\u201cAlex is from New Jersey, and so, when we graduated from Harvard, we spent a lot of time there, getting to know Camden, Trenton, Newark and Jersey City. We realized we did not have to go far to help those in need. We also recognized that the entrepreneurial spirit in each community could answer the community\u2019s own needs, so we decided to start Rising Tide Capital in Jersey City.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo who does Rising Tide Capital work with?\n\n\u201cThe average RTC entrepreneur is a 40-year-old single mother of two children, earning less than $35,000 a year,\u201d she explains. \u201cNinety percent of our entrepreneurs are minorities and 70 percent are women. Eighty percent of RTC entrepreneurs are low- to moderate-income, and 27 percent are unemployed at intake.\u201d\n\nWith the help of philanthropists like multibillionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s son Peter, who is co-president of the NoVo Foundation, Demmellash plans to expand the program nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWithin the next five years, we see the build-out of our replication program and the emergence of a national community of Rising Tide Capital entrepreneurs,\u201d she says. \u201cAs Rising Tide Capital has grown, we\u2019ve had requests from many communities for our programs. We held off on these requests because we wanted to stabilize our model and strategize intentionally on the best way to bring our work to more communities.\u201d\n\nKnowing they\u2019re onto something makes Demmellash that much more motivated to serve.\n\n\u201cWe often hear people say, \u2018A rising tide lifts all boats,\u2019 but what if you don\u2019t have a boat?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat if you are an aspiring entrepreneur with a viable business idea in an area where there are no resources available to you? What I\u2019ve found is that the only difference between entrepreneurs in Rwanda or Jersey City versus Silicon Valley is access to resources and opportunities. A recent Project Diane report found that, on average, black women founders raise $36,000 in venture funding, while $1.3 million goes to failed startups owned mostly by white men. Rising Tide Capital exists to give underserved entrepreneurs the same access to financial and support networks\u2014to build those boats.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo participate in Rising Tide Capital\u2019s Community Business Academy, you must be over 18 years old with an idea or talent that you would like to grow into a viable business, and have some experience in the industry in which you want to grow your business.

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["trend", "rock", "ongoing", "argument", "love", "right", "stella", "appropriationvsappreciation", "ankara", "kwanzaa", "style", "african", "wearing", "black", "fashion", "ankhs", "know", "way"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET.

On Wednesday, the magazine announced that \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d\u2014the victims of sexual harassment and assault who have come forward to tell their stories\u2014had earned the distinction of being its Person of the Year for 2017.\n\nTime Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show in an interview Wednesday morning that this year\u2019s #MeToo movement represented the \u201cfastest-moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades, and it began with individual acts of courage by women and some men too.\u201d\n\nTime\u2019s article features an array of women and men from all backgrounds and walks of life. There are the celebrities who initially grabbed headlines, like actress Ashley Judd, who was the first to go on the record to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. But there is also a hospital worker, an engineer, a strawberry picker, a housekeeper, an entrepreneur\u2014all of whom had their portraits taken for the piece.\n\nWhile prominent public figures like Judd and Terry Crews drove the conversation about sexual harassment and sexual assault to the forefront, the article is arguably most effective in showing the scope of a pervasive, global problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time writes:\n\nThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City\u2019s regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They\u2019re part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.\n\nTime magazine says its team spent six weeks compiling stories of harassment and assault, interviewing dozens of men and women in a windowless room in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District. Following Time\u2019s announcement of the Person of the Year, Charlotte Alter, a national correspondent for the outlet, noted on Twitter that the piece was \u201cconceived, reported and written by women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was fact-checked by women,\u201d Alter added. \u201cThe video was shot and edited by women. The layout and photo spread were designed by women.\u201d\n\nA conspicuous absence on Time magazine\u2019s front cover, though, is that of Tarana Burke, who originally used the phrase \u201cme too\u201d to build solidarity among survivors of sexual abuse more than a decade ago. Burke is featured in both the promotional video for the story and within the article itself.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment does bring shame,\u201d Burke told the magazine. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTime does note that people of color\u2014as well as immigrants, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people\u2014face \u201cmany types of dread\u201d when they come forward to report sexual abuse.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they raised their voices, would they be fired?\u201d the article notes. \u201cWould their communities turn against them? Would they be killed?\u201d\n\nAmong the people of color whose experiences are profiled are Crystal Washington, one of seven employees of the Plaza Hotel who have filed a sexual harassment suit against the hotel; and Adama Iwu, a lobbyist who organized an open letter exposing harassment in the California Legislature. Terry Crews, the most recognizable man to come forward with sexual harassment claims, is also shown prominently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNobody questions the predator,\u201d Crews told Time. \u201cYou know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, \u2018No more.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, not everyone who\u2019s come forward with their stories has been embraced. Anita Hill is rightfully mentioned as a predecessor to the #MeToo movement who did not receive the same groundswell of public support. And among the most conspicuous celebrity absences may be that of actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, who is among the dozens of women who came forward with stories of Weinstein\u2019s predatory and harassing behavior toward them\u2014and the only one whose story he specifically disputed.\n\nAnd it turns out, Donald Trump, who claimed he would \u201cprobably\u201d have been Time person of the year, did get a mention\u2014as the sexual harasser in chief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusan Fowler, a former engineer at Uber, cited the president as a reason she decided to blow the whistle on her former employer.\n\n\u201cI remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\u201d Fowler told Time. \u201cI felt like I had to take action.\u201d\n\nRead more at Time.", "keywords": ["harassment", "forward", "women", "silence", "men", "come", "article", "told", "breakers", "magazine", "person", "movement", "sexual", "names"], "polarity": 0.20022434163059163, "subjectivity": 0.4746978715728715},

Not only did Donald Trump become president, but he went about shoring up white supremacy as swiftly as possible.\n\nUnder his leadership, hate groups have grown and protections for marginalized people have been eagerly dismantled by the administration. And people of color, women and anyone who can be identified as \u201cother\u201d on a census form became even more obvious targets of overt prejudice, racist violence and blatant sexism.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. A February American Psychological Association poll found that 57 percent of Americans feel \u201csignificant stress\u201d thanks to today\u2019s political climate. We\u2019re also more anxious, more restless and extra sensitive in familiar surroundings. It\u2019s like we\u2019re drifting away on a wave of sadness.\n\nBut there might be an antidote to this languishing emotional recession.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that supporting and encouraging women of color to start their own businesses can give all of us a jolt of new energy and help us slow the descent into the psychological black hole that is the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay with me.\n\nWe need women of color to start their own businesses\u2014en masse\u2014for a few reasons. First, the rest of us can go work for them! (Explaining why that would be beneficial requires its own article.) The rest of us can support their creativity while experiencing what it\u2019s like to be valued and respected. We\u2019d also get a collective break from white supremacy at work (pun intended).\n\nAnd right now, we need a break.\n\nIn 2017 we\u2019re going to therapy more, with online therapy company TalkSpace reporting a jump in new patients this year, especially among people targeted by Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric. We\u2019re also self-medicating more, as evidenced by the spike in drinking among women of color and other groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s also face the fact that under Trump, women of color probably encounter even greater obstacles in getting promoted and earning what they\u2019re worth in traditional work environments. Trump governs by toxic masculinity and white supremacy. And he is taking a sledgehammer to opportunity and protective programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Title IX and Obama-era measures that would require companies to disclose how much they pay workers in order to address the gender pay gap.\n\nAccording to the research group Catalyst, women of color often lack the support (pdf) needed to move up the ranks in their workplace. They also face challenges for \u201csticking out\u201d and in trying to \u201cblend in.\u201d The report concluded that \u201c[b]ecause corporate environments typically do not reflect the behavioral norms common to the cultural backgrounds of women of color, these women may have to go to great lengths to adjust to the corporate environment and to network effectively.\u201d\n\nSo the rest of us have to step up and support women of color so that they can work in environments that utilize skills, perspectives and experiences that are not always fully expressed or nurtured in white-dominant workplaces. Two words: Ava DuVernay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe visionary filmmaker recently explained that instead of trying to break the glass ceiling, she is focused on \u201cbuilding my own house.\u201d\n\nWe need more Ava DuVernays. And Shonda Rhimeses. And Issa Raes. And Maria Hinojosas. But the rest of us have to put in work so that these gifted women among us can start their own enterprises\u2014to maximize and monetize their talents and possibilities\u2014and set the country on a better path as we prepare to become a majority-minority country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, women of color have already mastered so many of the requisite skills. From their work leading extended intergenerational families to organizing PTAs and church groups and running informal beauty and catering businesses from home, women of color have the human resources acumen to run successful enterprises and to empower employees to do their best work. They delegate, supervise and orchestrate major events like weddings, annual family gatherings, quincea\u00f1eras and large Greek-life gatherings.\n\nFrom these private and public experiences, women of color also emerge with a hard-won emotional intelligence, which a recent study shows is already more abundant in women. Experience shows that women of color have borne the burden of being de facto social workers, group therapists and conflict mitigators at work and school whenever racial tensions and intersectional misunderstandings flare up. The rest of us need to make sure they capitalize on those so-called soft skills.\n\nWe can start supporting women of color right now.\n\nPatronize their online stores and brick-and-mortar restaurants. Support their crowdfunding campaigns. Hire them for corporate projects. Donate to their nonprofits and join as volunteers. Buy their books, artwork and clothing lines. There are many opportunities in our daily lives to be intentional about finding and supporting a woman of color.

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET.

There are exceptions, of course, but structurally \u2014 just like black students \u2014 the ghosts of yesteryear rightfully still prevents many from fully buying into this system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaking sure that Native students do not have to worry about paying college tuition would normalize college and, understanding that the land will not end up back with us, give some level of equity in our ability to learn and earn and protect our homelands. . . .\u201d\n\nTim Giago, indianz.com: Not everything about the American Indian Movement was positive\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVeteran D.C. correspondent Lourdes Meluz\u00e1 has signed off for a final time this week, retiring from Univision after 30 years with the network,\u201d Veronica Villafa\u00f1e reported Thursday for her Media Moves site. \u201cMeluz\u00e1, who joined Miami\u2019s Univision 23 in 1987, became the network\u2019s D.C. correspondent in 1993, covering the White House and Congress. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

Take them out.\u201d And just in case that was too subtle, Trump suggested that the U.S. bring in more immigrants from countries like Norway.\n\nThe comments were originally reported by the Washington Post and confirmed by Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin (Trump has denied he ever said such things).\n\n\n\nNow the New York Daily News reports that a Haitian ambassador has \u201cformally summoned a U.S. official\u201d to explain Trump\u2019s racist remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Times journalist Yamiche Alcindor spoke with Paul Altidor, Haiti\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., and disclosed some of that conversation during an appearance on Rachel Maddow\u2019s MSNBC show.\n\nAlcindor told Maddow that the Haitian government is taking \u201cformal steps\u201d to let Trump know that he can catch these hands they are \u201cupset.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlcindor also noted that the Haitian government has already looked past another derogatory comment Trump made about Haitians. During a June meeting on immigration, Trump reportedly said, \u201cAll Haitians have AIDS.\u201d Alcindor says that Haiti chose to look the other way in the interest of resolving the temporary protected status of Haitians living and working in the U.S. after a 2010 earthquake devastated the country.\n\nTheir TPS was revoked late last year.\n\nThe government of Botswana also released a statement via Twitter addressing its \u201cdispleasure\u201d with Trump\u2019s \u201chighly irresponsible, reprehensible and racist\u201d remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ministry of International Affairs and Cooperation wrote that it had spoken to the U.S. ambassador to Botswana \u201cto express its displeasure at the alleged utterances made by the President of the U.S.\u201d and to clarify whether Trump considered Botswana to be \u201ca shithole country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Government of Botswana is wondering why President Trump must use this descriptor and derogatory word when talking about countries with whom the U.S. has had cordial and mutually beneficial bilateral relations for so many years,\u201d the ministry\u2019s statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBotswana also noted that the country has hosted many U.S. citizens and government officials over the years, including a congressional delegation scheduled to arrive at the end of the month.\n\nOf course, government officials weren\u2019t the only ones calling out the \u201cpresident.\u201d\n\nAs the Daily News noted, South African Broadcasting Corp. anchor Leanne Manas tweeted, \u201cGood morning from the greatest most beautiful \u2018shithole country\u2019 in the world!!!\u201d early Friday morning, local time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat tweet was co-signed as far away as Malaysia:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post collected some of the responses from Africans and Haitians to Trump\u2019s shitty comments, including one from The Daily Show, writing on behalf of its South African host, Trevor Noah: \u201cAs someone from South Shithole, Trevor is deeply offended by the president\u2019s remarks.\u201d", "keywords": ["south", "president", "clap", "shithole", "alleged", "noted", "haiti", "trumps", "trump", "racist", "haitians", "countries", "botswana"], "polarity": 0.1414314194577352, "subjectivity": 0.41488835725677825},

The film was adapted from the 2008 Hillary Jordan novel about two families\u2014one black and one white\u2014attempting to stay afloat by sharecropping the same patch of hard Mississippi acreage in the World War II era.\n\nI won\u2019t drop any spoilers here, but Mudbound is a captivating watch\u2014the film was nominated for two Golden Globes (though it ultimately lost), and Mary J. Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list. But John Singleton\u2019s best film not named Boyz n the Hood remains the gold standard of don\u2019t-bring-your-Anglo-ass-anywhere-within-10-yards-of-me-after-I-watch-this filmmaking. Based on a real-life 1920s massacre following the lie of a white woman on a black man, not many films before or since Rosewood have so unflinchingly depicted raw white brutality on black bodies. Every time I find myself thinking I want to rewatch it, I think about how I actually plan to walk outside my crib and interact with these motherfuckers again at some point.", "keywords": ["films", "man", "world", "list", "theres", "white", "mudbound", "young", "black", "film", "pissed", "war", "folks"], "polarity": 0.05818222202368542, "subjectivity": 0.45249218261413376},

The local news was beginning to feel like trauma porn and was much too close to home.\n\nThe purge had been a healthy choice\u2014that is, until national news infiltrated my timeline, the Twitterverse and the whole-ass webosphere with film executive Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged history of rape and sexual assault against women he worked with. Not long after, Kevin Spacey, lead actor of Bryan Singer\u2019s The Usual Suspects, entered a band of unusual suspects\u2014grown-ass men accused of sexually preying on children. Spacey apologized to his accuser, actor Anthony Rapp, who was 14 years old at the time he says he was assaulted, for \u201cwhat would have been deeply inappropriate behavior\u201d\u2014behavior that Spacey doesn\u2019t quite recall.\n\nWhile all of this news is disturbing, none of it hits close to home like the more obscure, resurfacing news of R&B musician R. Kelly and his alleged bizarre sexual practices and undying affinity for underage black girls. Apparently, the victimization of young black girls is not newsworthy enough for the mass media or the court of public opinion to be engrossed or enraged at Weinstein levels. Both treat the sexual assault of black girls as if it were hardly news at all. To a fault, they are right. The predatory sexualization of young black girls is so ubiquitous, it is damn near an accepted social and cultural norm.\n\n\n\nThe system of slavery helped us arrive at this place, where black girls are denied humanity. In captivity, their bodies were perpetually preyed upon. In bondage, they were much more than field hands and domestics. Not only did they have the duty of being medical lab rats, as was the case of Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy\u2014three slave girls used for gynecological experimentation by physician J. Marion Sims\u2014but they were also forced to sexually perform as bed wenches and breeders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the most profound case, an enslaved Sally Hemings bore six children by her master, Thomas Jefferson, the first at age 15\u2014when he was 43. Because Jefferson kept her close, in a bedroom adjacent to his own, many historians make the mistake of romanticizing Hemings and Jefferson\u2019s relationship as some enchanting antebellum love affair, but we must be clear of its obvious implications. The dynamic between slaveholder and slave is one of absolute power. A sexual relationship between a fully grown man and an adolescent child is absolutely salacious. It is statutory rape\u2014albeit sanctioned by the laws of the land at the time.\n\n\n\nAnd although white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy serves as a springboard for society\u2019s well-established disregard of young black girls, the slave code ended 152 years ago. We all should know better and do better\u2014especially the black community.\n\nGrowing up between the late 1980s and early \u201990s, during the peak of the crack era, it was not uncommon to see fresh, baby-faced girls in the company of men who were well into their mid-20s or older. The practice of courting minors was not exclusive to any particular demographic of men. It included the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\u2014and for the most part, they all had short eyes. These sexual predators, in the heart of many hoods, exacted power over teenage girls through fast cars, money and drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence, approximately 40 percent of black women report coercive sexual contact by age 18.\n\n\n\nI am no stranger to this lifestyle.\n\nI know firsthand about having one\u2019s virginity pounded into extinction, at the age of 14, for a pair of Reebok 54-11\u2019s and a pair of gold bangle earrings\u2014compliments of a 23-year-old fan. I was finessed. It was like taking candy from a baby, and it was also euphemized rape. Not one rational adult intervened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual predation, for many black girls, starts long before the age of sexual awareness. They become innocent victims in their own households, social settings, churches and schools under the guise of supervision. These girls are preyed upon by family members, community leaders, religious figures and educators. In a lot of cases, they are disappointed in and dismissed by adults they should be able to trust.\n\n\n\nSome are victim-shamed; others are disbelieved or silenced by threats, like those the now-13-year-old alleged victim of Jelani Maraj, the brother of rapper Nicki Minaj, describes; those experienced by 18-year-old Anna Chambers, who tells of having been sexually assaulted by two New York City police officers while detained; and those made against the unprecedented number of girls whose names we do not know\u2014yes, #ThemToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual violence is projected onto black girls at a higher rate than it is onto other races and ethnicities. In the Fourth National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect:\n\nAfrican-American women were 1.75 times more likely than white women to have experienced child sexual abuse.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report the occurrence of child sexual abuse during adolescence.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report an increased incidence of perpetrators living in the same household.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese facts are hella disturbing and reflect a culture of sexual violence against black girls that remains crickets as fuck. Where\u2019s the community outrage? Where is the overwhelming media coverage? For black girls, there is no black collective rallying against these crimes. There is no public shaming or takedown of sexual violators, because society gives zero fucks, and the black community protects its villains and devalues its girls.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement\u2014an initiative that supports young women surviving sexual assault\u2014agrees that in the black community, the value of girls is at an all-time low. \u201cWe all have to be accountable for how we view and protect and cast our black girls,\u201d Burke says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a phone interview, she expressed that \u201cthe world diminishes black girls and the black community upholds it.\u201d This flagrant attitude toward young black women is the very thing that keeps R. Kelly in business and away from major media attention.\n\nBurke makes it clear that Weinstein and Kelly are of the same ilk. She notes that while the former receives a national flogging for sexually assaulting grown white women, the latter continues to get away unscathed for alleged sex crimes against underage black girls. Black people\u2019s allegiance to Kelly is reflective of how the black community celebrates its villains, and hints at the lack of value placed on young girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have to shift their way of thinking when it comes to black girls. We have to believe our young girls and recognize when they\u2019ve been violated. Support them.\u201d \u2014Tarana Burke\n\nAs simple as it seems, Burke\u2019s statement is a whole-ass word.\n\n\n\nBut what statement is Snoop Dogg making when he features R. Kelly at his wife\u2019s birthday event? What do his actions convey to young black girls?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s a clown\u2014shitting on black-girl value.\n\nInstead of inviting predators to the barbecue, Sunday dinner and birthday bashes; instead of calling out a high-profile Hollywood rapist, perhaps we should be as vigilant in calling out our own. As Burke puts it, \u201cKelly belongs to us. He is ours to deal with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must begin to fully reckon with that dealing. That also goes for those uncles who we know have their own Weinstein-length histories of fondling pubescent nieces; brothers who overpower young sisters, as actor Kevin Spacey allegedly did his victim; friendly neighbors who stalk our girls\u2019 bodies; Ahk and them from the corner bodega, who bribe young daughters into storeroom closets; hustlers who pick and pluck them; pimps who turn them out. Like Robert Kelly, they ain\u2019t shit.\n\nWhen we seek accountability from others, perhaps we hold ourselves accountable as well, for aiding and abetting, for being quiet, for turning blind eyes to those in close proximity. \u2019Cause at the end of the day, if we\u2019re going to normalize pedophilia and sexual misconduct in our own spaces, perpetuated on our own girls, then we must acknowledge our own complicity\u2014admit that we, too, ain\u2019t shit.\n\nJustification for that type of foul ain\u2019t justice at all. If we stop letting heathens off the hook for sexualizing our babies, then perhaps we can stop blaming our babies for being sexualized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIda Harris is aiight with standard English but poetic with black vernacular.

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

On Wednesday\u2019s Daily Show, host Trevor Noah invited regular correspondent Roy Wood Jr. to give his perspective on the issue before the two of them bounced some creatively cathartic replacement ideas off each other.\n\n\n\nWood took the time to dismantle some of the most popular Confederate statue enthusiast talking points, which wasn\u2019t really that hard. Wood pointed out how most of these monuments to those who fought so valiantly to keep black people as property were, in fact, erected long after the Civil War had ended, as a method of reminding black Americans of their \u201csecond-class\u201d status during the Jim Crow era. Wood went after the idea that it\u2019s important to remember the South\u2019s long history of slavery via pretty statuary, comparing it to a woman being forced to keep pictures of her abusive ex around the house. (\u201cI don\u2019t need pictures to remember pain,\u201d is Wood\u2019s summation.) He also debunked the idea that the average Confederate memorabilia buff isn\u2019t motivated by racial animus, aided by the on-camera rant of one Russell Walker, whose interview after losing a lawsuit to restore the Confederate flag to South Carolina courtrooms saw the totally not-bigoted flag fan letting slip a particularly vile version of the name of Martin Luther King that is clearly part of his squirmy, race-baiting inner monologue.\n\nWith Noah joining in, Wood came up with his own alternatives to the various solutions being enacted and proposed for dealing with what are finally being openly lambasted as monuments to slavery (and rallying points for those who clearly think slavery wasn\u2019t such a bad idea). Sure, their proposals (involving past and present black historical figures doing rude things) might be impractical and/or goofy. But Wood pointed out that Charlottesville\u2019s temporary plan to drape its Confederate monuments in black tarps isn\u2019t even as effective as drinking your beer on the street out of a paper bag. As he puts it, \u201cWith a paper bag, at least you\u2019re acknowledging that you\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201d", "keywords": ["confederate", "slavery", "youre", "trevor", "jr", "wood", "brainstorm", "things", "idea", "remember", "monuments", "black", "noah", "daily", "roy", "wasnt"], "polarity": 0.06540404040404045, "subjectivity": 0.5122280497280498},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["2017", "moments", "women", "land", "kaepernick", "la", "tyson", "white", "won", "twitter", "black"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/kevin-spacey-and-the-damage-done-1820052424", "title": "/kevin-spacey-and-the-damage-done-", "text": "By now, we\u2019ve all heard about Anthony Rapp\u2019s allegations of sexual assault by Kevin Spacey when Rapp was 14 and Spacey was 26. Waking up in the middle of the night to the revelation of Rapp\u2019s story and Spacey\u2019s response felt like a punch in the gut because it doesn\u2019t just happen in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAs a black queer man who was sexually abused as a child by a man who now identifies as gay, this Spacey public relations stunt of coming out while addressing Rapp\u2019s allegations saddens me in indescribable ways. We\u2019re in an era where someone can tweet an apology for allegedly sexual assaulting a person then try to escape accountability by owning his sexual identity publicly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, another actor, Roberto Cavazos, accused Spacey of sexual harassment. Cavazos was 26, Spacey 49.\n\n\u201cThere are many of us who have a \u2018Kevin Spacey story.\u2019 It seems the only requirement was to be a male under the age of 30 for Mr. Spacey to feel free to touch us,\u201d Cavazos wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cIt was so common that it became a local joke (of very bad taste).\u201d\n\nCavazos said that Spacey often \u201croutinely preyed\u201d on young male actors and said he fended off two \u201cunpleasant\u201d advances from Spacey that \u201cbordered on harassment,\u201d but that others were afraid to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCavazos isn\u2019t the only man who came forward this week. Filmmaker and producer Tony Montana claims Spacey groped him in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. Montana says he was left with post-traumatic stress disorder for at least six months after Spacey \u201cforcefully\u201d grabbed his crotch. Montana was in his 30s when the alleged harassment occurred.\n\nSpacey has yet to respond to the most recent allegations, but his using his sexuality as a shield against Rapp\u2019s allegations is dangerous and destructive. What\u2019s worse, many people will continue to try to draw a connection between pedophilia and homosexuality when most child sexual abusers identify as heterosexual men, not gay men\u2014and many are in consensual relationships with women.\n\nI\u2019ve been an openly queer man of 10 years and nothing brings me more happiness than people who feel safe and affirmed enough to invite people into their personal lives. Personally, I know this feeling and it is complicated. As I wrote in The Atlantic in 2013, \u201cComing out was both liberating and constricting, for me. It was beautiful although the consequences were occasionally ugly. I am glad I came out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis coming out, or inviting in, is not easy, and what makes it worst is someone in the LGBTQ community using his now-public sexual identity as a way of escaping accountability for allegedly committing a heinous act on a person\u2019s autonomy. It didn\u2019t help matters when media outlets like Reuters, People magazine, the New York Daily News and ABC News, among others, chose to focus on Spacey\u2019s coming out.\n\nSpacey\u2019s sexuality has nothing to do with his allegedly molesting someone. As a survivor, this is why it was difficult discussing being sexually assaulted by a man when I was younger. Though I am openly queer now, before going public, the main comment people made once finding out about my assault was, \u201cIt has nothing to do with your sexuality.\u201d\n\nOnce I understood what was being said, I grew frustrated that the immediate harm being addressed was what the abuse could mean for my actual or perceived sexuality. It made me realize it\u2019s because many people think sexual abuse and sexuality are somehow connected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s completely irresponsible for any person or media to have a conversation about Spacey\u2019s sexuality because it\u2019s salacious. Talk about the ways in which Spacey allegedly molested a teenager when he was an adult and the impact that might have on the child. Discuss how multiple men have now come forward accusing Spacey of unwanted sexual advances, but do not connect this to his sexuality. Spacey has made that wrong connection even worse.\n\n\n\nBeing assaulted by a man who later acknowledged being gay confused me so much about my own sexuality because I connected my sexuality to being abused. It took years to rework that my sexuality was not borne out of pain. I was not gay because I was abused.\n\nEven though my abuser didn\u2019t \u201ccome out\u201d until many years after he assaulted me, Spacey\u2019s response made me relive my entire interactions with my abuser and my own thinking on sexuality and abuse. I was a black boy who was already told that being gay was a problem; imagine adding on top of that the idea that my sexuality was connected to the abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, Spacey knew exactly what he was doing by \u201ccoming out\u201d in response to sexual assault allegations. I\u2019ve never been a fan of the \u201cright time\u201d to come out, but we all know this happened as a way to distract from the real story while simultaneously offering a fake apology for maybe allegedly assaulting a teenager. I\u2019m not allowing that.\n\nI\u2019m also not allowing for folks who don\u2019t seem to understand why people are upset at the convenience of Spacey\u2019s timing. His statement conflates molestation, sexuality and drunkenness in a way that will ultimately harm queer people who are merely attempting to live a free life.\n\nAnd Spacey\u2019s response also doesn\u2019t leave room for people like Rapp, who will experience lifelong social, emotional and psychological effects from his abuse. I know what it\u2019s like to be Rapp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, Rapp, I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you. I\u2019m sorry that a man used his celebrity and emotional prowess to make your assault about his own disconnected sexuality.\n\nIt is not right, and you are not wrong.", "keywords": ["man", "spaceys", "allegations", "response", "sexuality", "kevin", "gay", "allegedly", "coming", "sexual", "spacey", "damage"], "polarity": 0.05169632450882451, "subjectivity": 0.5425173784548785},

Noah replayed a clip of the original video of the shooting, which Castile\u2019s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, livestreamed on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery time I watch that video, I just ask myself how ... just how?

What was different in 2017, more so than any other year in recent memory, was how those polarities were laid bare for everyone else to see.\n\n\n\nIt was the year American streets were crowded with both pussy hats and neo-Nazis. It was the year Confederate monuments were torn from their bases and irate NFL fans cursed at their TVs as black players kneeled en masse. Both \u201ccomplicit\u201d and \u201cfeminism\u201d were designated \u201cwords of the year\u201d (the first by Dictionary.com, the second by Merriam-Webster\u2019s) in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a year that saw the careers of dozens of the world\u2019s most powerful men crash and burn while a man accused of multiple instances of sexual abuse continued to tweet from the Oval Office. It was the year a Democrat won a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. It was the year an alleged pedophile was endorsed by the most powerful man in the free world.\n\nLooking back on the year, no one work sums up the horrors and polarities of the year more than Get Out. It was undoubtedly the movie of 2017: a genre-bending film that managed to feel both timely and overdue. But what makes it not just the film of 2017, but emblematic of it, is best captured in audiences\u2019 divergent reactions to it.\n\nIn a recent interview with Seth Meyers on his late-night show, Allison Williams, who plays the film\u2019s surprise villain, Rose Armitage, describes the reaction she received from white people who had trouble believing that her character, a woman who preyed upon black people, was actually evil:\n\nThey\u2019d say, \u201cShe was hypnotized, right?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s just evil!\u201d How hard is that to accept? She\u2019s bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she\u2019s bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That\u2019s so crazy! And they\u2019re still like, \u201cBut maybe she\u2019s also a victim?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNO! No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence. To break the hypnosis that continues to bind and betray us all.", "keywords": ["2017", "women", "white", "violence", "black", "innocence", "virtue", "shes", "armitage", "rose", "supremacy"], "polarity": 0.06526736813871553, "subjectivity": 0.3853764921946739},

I believe that cats were put on earth to kill things. And I believe the universe recycles.\n\n\n\nReincarnation is real. When we stop breathing, our bodies will all eventually turn into the fuel for flowers and trees. Those trees will, in turn, take the fuel of our decomposed former selves and convert carbon dioxide into oxygen that a newborn baby will one day inhale for the first time. We are all dying. To die is to give life.\n\nAnd if my body becomes a tiny point in the circle of life, it only makes sense that my soul will also be reincarnated. I have no idea how the universe may use my factory-refurbished soul. I\u2019m cool with becoming a yak or a large-mouthed bass in the next life. (Fair warning to the universe: I am a terrible swimmer.) There is only one thing I pray I will never be:\n\nThe white man.\n\nNot a white man, but the white man. The perpetual oppressor of people. The kicker of teeth. He who places boot on neck.

I believe that any white person not actively fighting to end every form of racism and oppression is an accomplice. I fault white people who sit silently while their fellow Caucasians say or do something racist when no one black is around. I consider them to be upholders of white supremacy as much as the cross burners or swastika wearers. They are \u201cthe white man,\u201d too.\n\nBut I realize I am a living, breathing double standard.

And just as with racism, that willingness to turn our heads and not condemn sexual assault is an implicit signal that it is OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne night while I was having a few drinks with friends, a guy recognized someone at my table and came over to say hi. At some point during his conversation, the waitress came over, and out of nowhere, he asked this teenage-looking girl: \u201cCan you make it clap?\u201d\n\nEveryone knew it was kind of creepy, but I said, \u201cHey, man, what the fuck is wrong with you? That girl is, like, 16.\u201d He tried to laugh it off by joking: \u201cYou know what Keith Sweat said: She may be young, but ... \u201d\n\nBy then the rest of the people at the table agreed that he was being a little bit rapey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, I was with the same friends at the same watering hole (what, motherfucker? It\u2019s not like I live in Paris. I\u2019m in Birmingham!), and they began telling me about a high school teacher who had been arrested on charges that he slept with multiple students. Because I\u2019m not originally from this town (and apparently only go to one place to have drinks), I assumed that I didn\u2019t know who they were talking about.\n\nIt was the same rapey table crasher.\n\nHere\u2019s my point. I\u2019m not insinuating that every guy who makes suggestive comments to a Buffalo Wild Wings waitress is a potential sexual assaulter. But I wonder how often we perpetuate the ideology of the disposability of women\u2019s bodies by just not saying shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are honest, every single man has known a guy who was a habitual line stepper when it came to women or who was a little bit rapey. The frat brother who will grab a random woman\u2019s booty. The boss who has tried to fuck everyone in the office. The football teammate who always talks about \u201crunning a train.\u201d I also believe every single white person has a parent, co-worker or cousin (wait ... do white people have cousins?) who leans a \u201clittle bit racist.\u201d\n\nBut just like there is no such thing as being a little bit racist, there is no such thing as being \u201ca little bit rapey.\u201d\n\nWhy are we cool with one and not the other?\n\nIf we refused to remain quiet about the dudes who do this shit, I\u2019m not saying that it would end sexual assault, but it might curtail the actions of the men whose actions are fueled by the complicity of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knew about Harvey Weinstein and didn\u2019t say shit. Bill Cosby\u2019s predilection for slipping Mickeys was an open secret for decades. Do you think R. Kelly\u2019s friends are just now noticing that some of the girls surrounding him are a little short in the tooth?\n\nI know some woke-ass dudes who would open-hand smack a Caucasian\u2019s face off if the white person uttered the word \u201cnigger\u201d in their presence, even if that person wasn\u2019t using the n-word in reference to anyone in particular. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the recipient of the smack were singing along to a Tupac song or used the version of the word with the \u201ca\u201d at the end\u2014he or she would become an unwilling participant in the catching of hands.\n\nBut those same woke-ass dudes wouldn\u2019t say a damn word if a guy talked about \u201ctaking some pussy\u201d or brought up booty-clapping to a teenager trying to do her job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nAnd I know some dude out there will argue that not every black man is complicit in sexual assault.

Was it awkward, exhilarating, overwhelming, tender, traumatic\u2014or some combination of all of the above?\n\nMine was all of those things. I was a high schooler in suburban Chicago, in the throes of my first\u2014and at that age, what I believed would be my last\u2014love. Even today, I can sincerely say that it was true\u2014if young\u2014love; and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion, I threw my inexperienced self headlong into it ...\n\nAt least, until my mother found out.\n\nTo say that my mother didn\u2019t take the loss of my virginity well would be putting it mildly. While she\u2019d educated me about sexuality and sexual health since I was 6 years old, I discovered my own sexuality earlier than either of us had planned\u2014if you can plan such a thing. I may have been in love, but for my mother and me, that revelation was mutually traumatic. I was mortified and scared; she was angry, disappointed, and\u2014as I\u2019d come to understand years later\u2014terrified by the thought that I might have compromised myself and my future so early in life.\n\nWhile we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there was something instantly recognizable about last Wednesday\u2019s episode of Grown-ish, in which protagonist Zoey Johnson and mom Rainbow (in a guest appearance by her Black-ish mom, Tracee Ellis Ross) found themselves in much the same situation. In a brief but poignant scene, Zoey revealed to her mother that she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014and had sex for the first time. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked. In the pregnant pause that followed (pun intended), I cringed along with her as she awaited her mother\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2014I just don\u2019t want to think about it ... but did you use protection? ... It was bound to happen at some point,\u201d Rainbow sputtered.\n\n\n\nIt was a refreshing moment\u2014and a departure from the usual conversations that occur around black girls and sexuality, in which we are generally divorced from our own innocence and vulnerability. The truth is, we\u2019re rarely presumed to be in love (or given the space to be), or exercising decision-making based on sexual autonomy and emotional intimacy\u2014let alone smart enough to protect ourselves. Instead, we\u2019re generally cast as over-sexualized and often \u201casking for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Zoey\u2019s being of college age was likely another key factor in how this scenario played out, even as a fictional mother (and doctor), Rainbow understood that sexuality was a natural part of her daughter\u2019s maturation. She also seemed to understand that that development wasn\u2019t destined to happen on her time. Her primary concerns\u2014aside from her child\u2019s physical safety\u2014were not for her daughter\u2019s \u201cpurity,\u201d but for the larger implications of her making what could be a lifelong commitment at such a young age; in this case, to leave college with a potentially NBA-bound boyfriend.\n\n\u201cZoey, I did not raise you like this,\u201d Rainbow ranted. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman who\u2019s just going to throw it all away for some guy? You worked so hard to get here!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the writers\u2019 room at Grown-ish really got it right this episode. Because instead of focusing on the loss of virginity (which didn\u2019t even merit its own scene), the focus was rightly placed on what it means for a black girl to commit herself to someone\u2014in mind and body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the discussion I wish my mother and I had had all those years ago. I wish she\u2019d trusted that she\u2019d taught me well on how to conduct myself physically, and focused on the emotional implications of my choice. Because while we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAs I\u2019ve since discussed with my mother, rarely does anyone tell young women what it\u2019ll be like when you first fall for someone\u2014and they, in turn, fall for you. Rarely does anyone tell you how overwhelming that will be, and how you\u2019ll do anything to hold on to that feeling. Beyond discussing sexual health\u2014and, now, rape culture\u2014rarely are we preparing our daughters to trust themselves emotionally, and to take their own agency sexually.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m personally grateful that a show like Grown-ish exists for this generation. Because as a member of several older generations of folks who often seem to lack the emotional intelligence to have productive, mutually respectful relationships, I think that maybe these are the conversations we need to be having.", "keywords": ["mother", "leave", "love", "mothers", "right", "sexuality", "grownish", "talk", "rainbow", "emotional", "daughters", "shed", "sexual", "weeks", "rarely"], "polarity": 0.15486830357142856, "subjectivity": 0.5726875},

Sexism is a national problem and deserves a commensurate response from our leaders. Our current systems\u2014including those in colleges and universities\u2014protect powerful men and permit rape culture to continue.\n\n\n\nThe Weinstein case highlights how poorly Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 policies on sex discrimination and assault meet the needs of women.\n\nIn late September, DeVos rescinded an Obama directive, also known as the \u201cDear Colleague Letter\u201d (pdf), on how campuses should handle sexual assaults under Title IX, the federal policy on sexual discrimination. The letter reminded campus officials that they were responsible for preventing sexual harassment and violence, and provided examples of remedies and enforcement strategies. DeVos repealed the Obama policy largely based on a defense of people wrongfully accused of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cThere are men and women, boys and girls, who are survivors,\u201d DeVos said in her speech on Title IX in September. \u201cAnd there are men and women, boys and girls who are wrongfully accused.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncredibly, DeVos used an \u201cAll victims matter\u201d rationale to rescind the Obama directive. The speciousness of this argument is made apparent by the fact that not once did she utter the word \u201csexism\u201d in her prepared remarks.\n\nThe Weinstein case\u2014and the subsequent waves of disclosures about men in power that continue to break\u2014should force DeVos to confront what she obviously ignored in her argument for repeal: Powerful institutions (especially those led by men) ignore women\u2019s accounts of being harassed, abused and assaulted.\n\nWorse, they are so hostile toward women and so protective of influential men that victims are scared to speak out. Witness all the accounts of women who stayed silent about the assaults and harassment for decades, or those who spoke up and say they experienced retaliation\u2014all while Weinstein sat untouched atop a Miramax empire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t evident to DeVos earlier, it should be clear now: She needs a do-over. As more and more women come forward, DeVos should hear the cries of sexual assault victims and actually make Title IX more about addressing systems and less about finding some weird moral equivalency between victims and accusers.\n\nTwo months before DeVos rescinded the guidance, Candice E. Jackson, DeVos\u2019 acting assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education, told the New York Times that 90 percent of sexual assault complaints \u201cfall into the category of \u2018We were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018We broke up, and six months later, I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter widespread outrage at the suggestion that women were equally culpable in most sexual assault cases on campus, Jackson apologized. She has since walked back her statement a bit, stating before a Senate panel last week, \u201cIt\u2019s unproductive to speak in terms of false accusations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Dear Colleague Letter issued by the department that DeVos now leads, there were \u201c4,000 reported incidents of sexual battery and over 800 reported rapes and attempted rapes occurring in our nation\u2019s public high schools.\u201d More than 1 in 10 will have been sexually assaulted in or out of school before high school graduation, and \u201c20 percent of women will be victims of attempted or actual sexual assault, as will about 6 percent of undergraduate men.\u201d\n\nWe should treat Weinstein as an individual monster\u2014and as a product of our educational system. The former we cannot change, but how our schools and colleges treat victims and the accused, that we can.\n\nPresident Barack Obama sought to prioritize the rights of the victims by telling colleges to allow accusers to appeal not guilty findings, to discourage cross-examination of accusers and to accelerate verdicts. Obama urged colleges to consistently use the \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d or what is more likely than not, standard in sexual assault cases. The preponderance of evidence is considered the lowest degree of evidence necessary to establish proof, which empowers women to name rapists. The higher the standard for proving an assault, the less likely it is that women will come forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should treat Weinstein as an individual monster\u2014and as a product of our educational system. The former we cannot change, but how our schools and colleges treat victims and the accused, that we can.\n\nMany colleges resisted, arguing that the preponderance-of-evidence standard was too low a bar and would invite false accusations. In addition, several of the accused complained that the Obama guidance robbed defendants of due process, violated their individual rights and disregarded the autonomy of colleges to adjudicate these cases. Colleges also complained that the appeal process under the Obama guidance actually stretched out cases.\n\n\n\nAcquiescing, DeVos replaced Obama-era Title IX polices with an interim guidance (pdf), which gives colleges the freedom to decide what standard of evidence to use. Instead of giving women more choices to name their assailants, DeVos empowered institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the tussle between the powerful and the powerless, DeVos has sided with \u201cthe Man.\u201d DeVos\u2019 interim guidance misses the point that powerful men, even within the noblest of institutions, abuse their power to the detriment of women.\n\nWe tend to look at colleges as being progressive or conservative. But we also need to look at them as male-dominated and protecting the interests of men. Even though women make up more than 56 percent of collegians, men constitute 70 percent of college presidents.\n\nCampuses should give victims the benefit of the doubt in cases involving sexual assault. In addition, colleges are the first and last line of defense against a criminal-justice system in which \u201conly a quarter of all reported rapes lead to an arrest, only a fifth lead to prosecution, and only half of those prosecutions result in felony convictions,\u201d according to Know Your IX, a survivor- and youth-led organization focused on ending sexual and dating violence. On and off-campus, due process seems to favor men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe tend to look at colleges as being progressive or conservative. But we also need to look at them as male-dominated, and protecting the interests of men.\n\nTake convicted rapist Brock Turner as an example. Turner, then a member of the Stanford University swim team, raped an unconscious woman in 2015. Turner was found guilty, and prosecutors sought six years. Turner, a white man, received a mere six-month sentence, a slap on the wrist for what Turner\u2019s father dismissed at the sentencing as \u201c20 minutes of action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat he did to me doesn\u2019t expire, doesn\u2019t just go away after a set number of years,\u201d wrote the unnamed victim in a letter submitted to the court. \u201cIt stays with me, it\u2019s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the judge who sentenced Turner\u2014Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky\u2014said, \u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.\u201d\n\nNo wonder women often seek and expect justice through the honorable confines of the university.\n\nColleges also have a difficult time adjudicating sexual assault cases. Colleges have different judicial systems and no uniform standard of evidence. The absence of a consistent standard results in the passage of too much time and different levels of justice, which is why federal guidance is needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also the legitimate question of whether colleges have the capacity to adjudicate sexual assault cases. But DeVos\u2019 unwillingness to name institutional sexism and gender bias renders her commentary on this front meaningless.\n\nIn the wake of Weinstein, what is more likely than not is the tradition of powerful academic institutions protecting male interests. The reason powerful men get away with rape and harassment is that systems protect them. And until we challenge the systems in our educational institutions, men like Weinstein will continue to find sanctuary in them.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["women", "obama", "betsy", "standard", "weinsteins", "men", "harvey", "assault", "system", "helps", "devos", "change", "colleges", "victims", "educational", "weinstein", "sexual", "produce", "need"], "polarity": 0.11527717652717653, "subjectivity": 0.4883204493918781},

Kelly\u2019s alleged predatory behavior, providing the umpteenth reminder that the singer continues to hide in plain sight. In \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d former DJ Kitti Jones recounts her past relationship with Kelly and accuses him of physically abusing her, forcing her to have sex with other women, and urinating on her. During a particularly scary fight, she says, \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest...He just turned into a monster.\u201d\n\nIt is an agonizing account of an abusive relationship, and it\u2019s not the only one out there. In a fairer world, R. Kelly should be rotting in a prison cell in a state of perpetual irritation that he\u2019ll never get to perform \u201cBump \u2018N Grind\u201d outside any venue not under the control of the Illinois Department of Corrections. No amount of \u201cgenius\u201d\u2014which has been long cited by fans who continue to monetarily support him in spite of a now decades-old accusations of inappropriate sexual relationships with minors\u2014can excuse anyone\u2019s predatory behavior.\n\nR. Kelly, his chocolate factory, his Zorro-inspired masks, his chitlin-play esque \u201cTrapped In The Closet\u201d series, his fake-ass Sam Cooke impersonations, and most of all, his incessant and at times antagonistic displays of overt sexuality in his music and accompanying imagery should have never happened, and the man behind it all should be rendered a pariah expelled from the pop cultural zeitgeist.\n\n\n\nInstead, in 2017, R. Kelly continues to thrive as an artist. What makes this all the more infuriating is that the Rolling Stone report comes at a moment in history in which powerful, predatory men are facing repercussions for their behavior.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarvey Weinstein may reportedly remain dedicated to making films in the future despite being marred in scandal and now presently under investigation for rape, but for all intents and purposes, he is done in Hollywood. Bill Cosby may or may not face prison time over allegations of rape, but his legacy is forever tarnished and he, a self-important moralizer to poor black people, has been exposed as a hypocrite. Moreover, if Page Six is correct that the comedian is taking $30 million loan against his Upper East Side townhouse to pay for his mounting legal bills as he prepares for retrial for sexual assault, his fortune is shrinking. Cosby\u2019s millions were built on a lie and used to obstruct justice and continue to violate women\u2019s autonomy: Let him die broke.\n\n\n\nWe also now know just how much sexual harassment permeated the workplace at Fox News. Reports of said harassment led to the ouster of the late Roger Ailes, who served as chairman and CEO of Fox News, and later, its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly. In the case of O\u2019Reilly, who is actively seeking a return to television, we are still learning details about how willing Fox News was to look the other way at allegations of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment for the sake of ratings.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that political analyst, author, and regular regurgitation of bullshit Mark Halperin sexually harassed and assaulted numerous women during his time as ABC News political director. Already, MSNBC has released a statement: \u201cWe find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\u201d Time will likely not be kind to Halperin, who infamously referred to then-President Obama as a \u201cdick.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood riddance.\n\nAnd yet, nothing has happened to R. Kelly despite similar reporting. This summer, Buzzfeed published a story that alleged Kelly has maintained a \u201csex cult.\u201d The gruesome details therein\u2014that he forces women to call him \u201cdaddy\u201d and controls every aspect of their lives, down to when they can urinate\u2014made the story go viral, but the tour went on and those who have continued to collaborate with him offered no comments on it. Shortly thereafter, Jezebel published an interview with another alleged former girlfriend who repeated some of the same accusations found in the Buzzfeed expose. The reporter behind the piece, Jim DeRogatis, has tried to warn the public about Kelly since his days as the pop music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\n\nR. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that Kelly from touring\u2014with the likes of successful female artists such as Monica and LeToya Luckett on the tour bill. One skim of Ticketmaster reveals that Kelly has arena tour dates through the end of the year. Kelly also remains a fixture on the radio. And based on Sam Smith wearing a T-shirt with his face plastered on it, Kelly remains a figure whose reverence is expanding with future generations rather than rightfully dying. Worse, many of his fans continue to be willfully ignorant about the accusations leveled against him. Because if you are buying a ticket to see R. Kelly perform, you are choosing to align yourself with a predator and dancing along to him in total complicity.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like Weinstein and Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class, particularly the ones involved in the cases DeRogatis investigated decades ago. Black girls and women who are not famous. It is also not easy for black girls and women of means and notoriety to earn the respect they deserve, so the burden on those without either to get people to care is even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein, no matter how powerful, could not match the celebrity of his accusers, which ranged from Mira Sorvino to Ashley Judd. Many of the women accusing Cosby of assault were white women; the most high-profile non-white accuser, legendary black model Beverly Johnson, was already famous. One can\u2019t be certain that it was all white women accusing Halperin and O\u2019Reilly of sexual misconduct and harassment respectively, but it is a reasonable assumption that most of them were, given the lack of diversity at mainstream media outlets. The same can be said of Megyn Kelly, a blond, white Fox News anchor and household name who spoke out against Ailes, effectively sealing his fate.\n\nOf course, R. Kelly isn\u2019t the only alleged predator thriving despite widespread rumors of abuse. Woody Allen continues to work with Hollywood\u2019s young actresses and veteran Oscar winners despite allegations that he molested Mia Farrow\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan. Then there is the 45th president of the United States, the self-congratulating pussy grabber.\n\nBut R. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics. His accusations have followed him for 20 years and he\u2019s left not only a widely reported paper trail in legal settlements, but in interviews when asked about whether he liked teenager girls, answered, first asked for clarification on how young in age constituted a teen. He was openly married to a teenage Aaliyah in the 1990s. When Kelly was acquitted on 14 counts of child pornography, five jurors claimed the absence of testimony from the alleged victim served as \u201cbig handicap\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s case\u2014a case that took prosecutors six years to get to trial.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know who R. Kelly really is. The question is whether he will he ever face any consequences. It may take a critical mass of victims to speak out, like in the cases of Cosby and Weinstein. But if the past is prologue, there is reason to worry. And even if Kelly finally faces the public banishment his accused behavior has commanded, it needn\u2019t ever be lost on us why it took so long to happen.", "keywords": ["particularly", "girls", "women", "r", "alleged", "predatory", "harvey", "meet", "black", "kelly", "weinstein", "sexual", "fate"], "polarity": 0.052174408014571946, "subjectivity": 0.4308380371904962},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

And I have a question and am in need of an answer.\n\nWhy is that some white women are incapable of focusing on a topic without shitting on someone else? I say this because I thought I was gonna have my hands full with Rose McGowan and her baseless comparison of white women to n-words, but then, almost concurrently, Mayim Bialik threw her hat in the ring in a bid to become the most problematic white woman at the moment by maligning sexual assault survivors.\n\nTo explain, with Weinstein being the big topic of the last few weeks, many a survivor has come forward to describe her chilling run-in with him (the latest being Lupita Nyong\u2019o), detailing just how \u201cpowerful\u201d and predatory Weinstein was. In the midst of such pain, these survivors set the tone, encouraging empowerment and healing to begin ... that is until Bialik opened her loud and wrong mouth.\n\nIn this midst of this healing, Bialik penned an article for the New York Times that she assumed would be helpful to the conversation, but it turned out to be one of the most triggering things many of us had read in the past week (and to be clear, I am aware of her \u201capology\u201d and that it exists, but that does not change the impact her piece had).\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t even have enough time to explain why the New York Times published said piece\u2014which grossly undermined the work they had done to expose Weinstein\u2014to begin with. But I do have time to explain the variety of ways that Bialik\u2019s piece is inflaming, shaming and victim-blaming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting with this:\n\n1. \u201cUgliness\u201d does not prevent an assault or unwanted advances. That is a gross and outdated myth.\n\nPerhaps the most egregious part of Bialik\u2019s op-ed is the assumption that being unattractive or possessing \u201cnontraditional\u201d looks (read: being \u201cugly\u201d) is enough to prevent a disgusting, dirt-ridden scuzz bag like Weinstein from harassing and/or assaulting you. The presumption here is that not looking a certain way\u2014or, rather, existing on the opposite spectrum from where a pretty person would live\u2014somehow allows you to squeeze by any potential assault or unwanted advance by (in this case) a cisgender straight white man. That a lack of \u201cfuckability\u201d will somehow save you from such a disturbing perpetuation of violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take it you\u2019re already shocked at such a claim, but I assure you there\u2019s more.\n\nBialik anchors this baseless assumption on her own personal but limited experience in this area, which includes no such encounter with Weinstein or a Weinstein-like figure. She makes sure to point that out by stating that these same \u201cnontraditional\u201d looks have given her\u2014\u201ca proud feminist\u201d\u2014and others like her \u201cthe \u2018luxury\u2019 of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.\u201d Apparently, she has gotten this far and avoided \u201cmen asking [her] to meetings in their hotel rooms\u201d because she and these other women don\u2019t represent Hollywood\u2019s \u201cimpossible standard of beauty.\u201d\n\nWhew.\n\nThat\u2019s ... a lot. And it\u2019s also completely erroneous. And here\u2019s why:\n\n2. Rape (and sexual assault) has never been about attraction. Or even sex. It is about power and control.\n\nOf course, there is the school of thought that assumes it is about both, but I would vehemently disagree. To assume that rape is chiefly about sex is to declare that assailants (in this case, straight cis men) are slaves to the urges of their dishonorable phallic member and have to contend with \u201c\u2018beastial proclivity\u2019, \u2018wanton lust\u2019 and \u2018unchained carnal desire\u2019\u201d in order not to rape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s bullshit.\n\nMen who rape or assault are evolved enough to know and do better. They opt not to because the act of rape and assault itself is about using violence as a means of holding power and control over a nonconsenting human being. And then, with that power, they go on to humiliate, violate and degrade their victim and, in turn, shame that person into silence. Because without the silence, there can be no dominance.\n\nThose who are still on the fence about this issue need look no further than the rise of stealthing. With that example, if one has prior and enthusiastic consent to proceed with healthy, consensual sex with a condom on, what is the point of steamrolling said consent by secretly removing the condom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe point is the thrill of trading an equal power balance in a consensual situation for an unequal power balance\u2014essentially, a power imbalance. Said imbalance would tip power in the perpetrator\u2019s direction, and that doesn\u2019t happen without someone being violated or someone else getting his or her power and autonomy stripped away.\n\nTHAT is the turn-on for these perpetrators. That power. That dominance. Not the goddamn sex or the attraction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that being the case, Bialik may be shocked to find that something superficial like downplaying her \u201cflirtatiousness\u201d would have no bearing on decreasing the likelihood of such a violation. She may be completely flabbergasted to find that over- or under-expressed femininity doesn\u2019t affect that likelihood, either.\n\nShe may also be shocked to find that those of us who are masculine-leaning women, men or nonbinary individuals are still just as susceptible to rape and assault. She may even be astounded to find that those of us who possess even more of those qualities that don\u2019t fit into Hollywood\u2019s \u201cimpossible standard[s] of beauty\u201d\u2014like being of color, disabled, queer, trans, fat, etc.\u2014are STILL susceptible to rape and assault.\n\nExcept she wouldn\u2019t be shocked. Because she knows this. She, in all of her Ph.D.-in-neuroscience glory (which she made sure to mention as if education can also stave off rape and assault\u2014something that we know is false, particularly if we look at the disgustingly high rate of rape and assault on college and university campuses), had to have known this. She has surely lived long enough to know that these arbitrary things that she has listed are not enough to stop rape or assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, if she did know this, what was the point of her article?\n\n3. Bialik\u2019s article is what I would liken to the equivalent of concern-trolling.\n\nOxford defines a concern troll as:\n\nA person who disingenuously expresses concern about an issue with the intention of undermining or derailing genuine discussion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if I am to abide by that definition, it makes perfect sense why the backlash to Bialik\u2019s New York Times piece was so visceral. Because her piece was coming not from a place of sincerity but, rather, from a sense of delayed superiority and gratification. I doubt that she set out to condemn Weinstein\u2019s actions or even comfort his victims (or any victim of sexual assault and rape) at all. Instead, I\u2019d wager that this was a thinly veiled attempt to feel vindicated for being rejected according to Hollywood\u2019s \u201cimpossible standard of beauty.\u201d\n\nThink about it. Per Bialik\u2019s own words in her article, it seems as if she has a fairly sizable chip on her shoulder about her looks and having been made fun of because of them over the years (and in her youth). Sure, she tries to dress it up with half-hearted attempts at self-deprecating humor, and details all the things she did to forget \u201cthose other girls\u201d (the pretty ones) and distinguish herself from them, but that\u2019s not enough to hide the resentment seeping through.\n\nAnd it is that same unaddressed resentment and perceived lack of \u201cfuckability\u201d that even allowed her to pen something so insensitive and tone-deaf. It also represents a line of fairly fucked logic that even I don\u2019t have the juice (or the degree) to fully analyze. Indeed, for her to even hint that the numerous survivors who have stepped forward might have avoided their fates by not buying into Hollywood\u2019s hype (read: being pretty) and by \u201ccultivat[ing] the parts of themselves that may not garner them money and fame\u201d is trifling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause in the end, \u201ca proud feminist\u201d would know that one\u2019s brains and beauty need not be mutually inclusive and that it is not on survivors or potential survivors to put an end to rape and sexual assault. Nah. \u201cA proud feminist\u201d would recognize that it is on us as people to put an end to it and put an end to the culture of silence that perpetuates it, as well as to the lack of justice that allows it to continue.", "keywords": ["world", "women", "shocked", "weinsteins", "concerntrolling", "harvey", "power", "mayim", "assault", "rape", "bialiks", "insecure", "white", "weinstein", "bialik", "survivors", "know"], "polarity": 0.06954925191767296, "subjectivity": 0.5458199792410318},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing.

You fought and you\u2019re still in a place that doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\nThat simple conversation explains a lot about the current social media flap about conservative host Tomi Lahren, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah and radio personality Charlamagne tha God from The Breakfast Club. Sometimes our legitimate black anger doesn\u2019t let us see what\u2019s going on and blinds us to how blacks in the Diaspora view American race relations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trevor Noah interviewed the Blaze\u2019s Tomi Lahren last week, no one predicted that it would create so many trending hot takes. Objectively, Noah\u2019s interview with Lahren was pretty good. Many of his longtime, mostly white, media critics turned away from their Jon Stewart memorial shrines long enough to praise Noah for coming into his own. Many black pundits and Twitterati did drive-by analyses of the interview after it went viral (because let\u2019s be honest; The Daily Show audience doesn\u2019t boast a regular large black viewership). The general consensus was either 1) Noah let Lahren off too easy or 2) he never should\u2019ve given her bigoted views a platform to begin with.\n\nSome of this early criticism by black Twitter wasn\u2019t exactly fair, since, unless you\u2019re a fan of his work, judging Trevor Noah\u2019s comedy and progressive chops by his one interview with Tomi Lahren is akin to judging Dave Chappelle by his \u201cGive Trump a chance\u201d monologue on Saturday Night Live and ignoring anything else he\u2019s done in comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, when Charlamagne tha God, faux woke comedian and professional troll from the radio show The Breakfast Club, was caught playing Instagram footsie angling for an interview with Lauren, black Twitter called the Drop Squad. Suddenly Charlamagne, and Noah, were sellouts, seduced by a White She-Devil and unwittingly giving a platform to increasingly bold white supremacists in this post-Trump America.\n\nTrevor Noah, relatively new to this game, is being dragged by Twitter for something he never did.\n\nI am a huge fan of Noah\u2019s brand of political humor and have been ever since I saw the documentary about his life, You Laugh but It\u2019s True, at a film festival in 2012. Since he took over The Daily Show in 2015, his critics have accused him of, basically, not being Jon Stewart. Trevor Noah doesn\u2019t embody the East Coast white liberal outrage that other Daily Show alums like John Oliver and Samantha Bee have honed with laserlike efficiency. For black folks wanting searing racial political humor, Larry Wilmore was on Comedy Central for a year picking up the slack. Noah didn\u2019t have the burden of being both black and white America\u2019s political-comedy catharsis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of that is different now with the election of white-nationalist-sympathizing Donald Trump. Black people are legitimately scared. In this age of creeping white nationalism, if a liberal host (especially a black one) has a conservative guest, anything short of a gladiator-style verbal evisceration, followed by a slow thumbs-down and a tossing of bloody rhetorical entrails to the audience for sport, is tantamount to collusion with the enemy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Trevor Noah\u2019s style, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. He\u2019s more Yakov Smirnoff than Paul Mooney. He\u2019s an outsider more bemused than enraged by our politics.\n\nIf there is any criticism I have of Noah in the wake of this fake controversy, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend enough time sharing how his worldview differs from the audience's. His best comedy is when he flips our flawed democracy into typical politics throughout Africa. As a child, he lived through apartheid, which was like the Batman of white supremacy; it took the best parts of racism from around the world and perfected it \u2026 at the expense of 85 percent of the population for 70 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust because Noah\u2019s comedy is more driven by the philosophy of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee than our Western notions of getting revenge and getting even doesn\u2019t make him soft on bigotry. Treating Lahren nicely after his show is no worse a crime than my South African colleagues tipping a white waiter in a restaurant that used to not serve blacks. Sometimes you show power by not letting bigots dictate your behavior.\n\nOver the next four (likely eight) years, there will be plenty of white-nationalist-sympathizing conservatives out there, and plenty of black media people who will try to suck up to them. Charlamagne tha God is a professional provocateur who thought he\u2019d get some clicks and some good trolling out of dangling a \u201cpretty white girl\u201d in front of his mostly black audience. But even he realized that he was playing himself.\n\nNoah, who perforated Lahren\u2019s bigotry for 20 minutes, shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crossfire of shade bullets aimed at Charlamagne. He\u2019s bringing good comedy and satire from a perspective that could do us some good in these coming trying times. Perhaps next time, black Twitter should listen to more than his comedy highlights before burying him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

News, a spokesman for Weinstein said, \u201cMr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry. Last year, she sent a personal invitation to Mr. Weinstein to see her in her Broadway show Eclipsed.\u201d\n\nI love how they threw in the part about her supposedly inviting him to a show, as if that would somehow mean he was not a predator. There are now more than 40 women accusing Weinstein of being a creepy, rapey perv, so save us your \u201cbut she invited me to her show\u201d spiel.\n\nAlso, to date, has Harvey come out to deny any other allegation against him? Why did he pick Nyong\u2019o as the accuser whose story he would deny?\n\nWe don\u2019t believe you, Harvey. You need more people.\n\nEarlier:\n\nActress Lupita Nyong\u2019o penned a heartfelt op-ed in the New York Times on Thursday saying that she, too, has been sexually harassed by Hollywood sexual predator Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have been following the news and reading the accounts of women coming forward to talk about being assaulted by Harvey Weinstein and others,\u201d Nyong\u2019o wrote. \u201cI had shelved my experience with Harvey far in the recesses of my mind, joining in the conspiracy of silence that has allowed this predator to prowl for so many years. I had felt very much alone when these things happened, and I had blamed myself for a lot of it, quite like many of the other women who have shared their stories.\u201d\n\nNyong\u2019o said that ever since tales of Weinstein\u2019s repeated abuse have been talked about openly by so many women, she has been unable to keep the memories of what happened to her from resurfacing.\n\n\u201cI have felt such a flare of rage that the experience I recount below was not a unique incident with me, but rather part of a sinister pattern of behavior,\u201d the actress wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o\u2019s first encounter with Weinstein happened in 2011 at an awards ceremony in Berlin. She was still a student at the Yale School of Drama, and an \u201cintermediary\u201d introduced Weinstein to her as \u201cthe most powerful producer in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nShe said that when she vetted Weinstein among her colleagues, she was told by a female producer to \u201ckeep Harvey in your corner.\u201d\n\nThe woman also advised her: \u201cHe is a good man to know in the business, but just be careful around him. He can be a bully.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o said that she exchanged information with Weinstein in hopes that he would consider her for one of his projects.\n\n\u201cI wanted to keep things professional, so I made a point of referring to him as \u2018Mr. Weinstein.\u2019 But he insisted that I call him by his first name,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn this first encounter, I found him to be very direct and authoritative, but also charming. He didn\u2019t quite put me at ease, but he didn\u2019t alarm me, either.\u201d\n\nHer next encounter with Weinstein involved him inviting her to his home in Westport, Conn., to attend a screening of a film. It was during this encounter that Nyong\u2019o got to witness firsthand just how predatory and overly aggressive Weinstein could be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had a driver pick her up and bring her to meet him at a restaurant in Westport prior to the screening. During the lunch, he tried to force an alcoholic beverage on her, she recounted, and when she repeatedly refused, he called her \u201cstubborn.\u201d\n\nThey went to his home after the lunch, and he introduced her to his domestic staff and his young children. He gave her a tour of the house and then gathered everyone into the screening room to watch the film.\n\nNyong\u2019o was attempting to watch the film, but 15 minutes into it, she said, Weinstein pulled her away and led her to a bedroom, telling her that he wanted to give her a massage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o said that moment was the first in which she felt unsafe. She offered to give him one instead as she tried to figure out a way to get out of the situation she was in. During the massage, Weinstein told her that he wanted to take his pants off, and when she told him that his doing that would make her uncomfortable, he got up to remove them anyway.\n\nNyong\u2019o told him that if they weren\u2019t going to watch the film he\u2019d invited her for, she was going to return to the Yale campus.\n\nMonths later, after a screening of the movie W.E. in New York City, Nyong\u2019o was at a restaurant when Harvey tried yet again, and this time he made it clear that he was after sex:\n\nBefore the starters arrived, he announced: \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.\u201d I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so na\u00efve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she rebuffed his advances, he told her, \u201cYou have no idea what you are passing up.\u201d\n\nShe told him, \u201cWith all due respect, I would not be able to sleep at night if I did what you are asking, so I must pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis whole demeanor changed at that point. \u201cThen I guess we are two ships passing in the night.\u201d I had never heard that saying before, so I remember asking him what it meant. \u201cIt means just that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are two ships going in two different directions.\u201d \u201cYes, I guess we are.\u201d \u201cSo we are done here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can leave.\u201d\n\nNyong\u2019o said that Weinstein made a veiled threat about her career, but as we\u2019ve all witnessed, she\u2019s doing just fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes immense bravery to come forward and recount your experience with a sexual predator, whether you are the first or the 100th woman to do so.\n\nNyong\u2019o deserves praise for her bravery. All the women coming forward do.\n\nAs she concluded in her op-ed, \u201cNow that we are speaking, let us never shut up about this kind of thing. I speak up to make certain that this is not the kind of misconduct that deserves a second chance. I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence.\u201d", "keywords": ["nyongo", "differently", "women", "wanted", "things", "predator", "harvey", "told", "actress", "lupita", "encounter", "remembers", "weinstein", "screening"], "polarity": 0.15605047069332784, "subjectivity": 0.5413706795849652},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

Everyone is loving it. I\u2019m loving it.\n\nMy inner queer squealed when Zoey was completely chill with her bisexual friend Nomi. I was thrilled to see bisexual visibility on the show, and hope there will be more queer visibility overall\u2014not just for jokes or sensational provocation, but to highlight part of the wide human spectrum young people (should) encounter on a college campus.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u00fcber-adorable Luca, whose #BlackBoyJoy gender-nonconforming style makes me hope that he\u2019s actually Zoey\u2019s future love interest, rather than junior Hotep Aaron. (It doesn\u2019t hurt that I can\u2019t help imagining the writers spending several hours watching Jaden Smith\u2019s \u201cWatch Me\u201d video to get Luca\u2019s styling just right.)\n\nRefreshingly, Zoey\u2019s chill in Grown-ish feels like a great evolution from the one-dimensional mini-millennial she portrayed in early seasons of Black-ish. Back in those initial seasons, Zoey seemed not only extremely self-absorbed but also not the brightest bulb in the box. She\u2019s changed so much that now, when her parents make jokes about being surprised she got into college, it sounds like lazy writing. This Zoey was definitely going to college; she\u2019s the embodiment of #BlackGirlMagic.\n\nTV Promos via YouTube screenshot\n\nThe excitement for this new spinoff reminded me of when I was a young closeted lesbian, sitting in front of the TV absorbed with A Different World. When it premiered in September 1987, I was a sophomore in high school (I know, I\u2019m dating myself royally). At the time, I wanted to be Denise Huxtable and attend an HBCU. As the series progressed, all I wanted was for Jaleesa to be my big sister, Freddie to be my homey and Whitley to be my sorority sister, and to eventually fall in love with and wife up Kimberly Reese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exploits that happened on the hallowed Hillman campus pushed my friends and me to believe that college was not just a thing we were going to do; it was a thing we had to do. We had to do it for the culture. For us\u2014and in many ways because of the show\u2014we knew that young black people went to college, and they were successful, smart and ambitious. They were everything I (and we) needed them to be at the time. They were mirrors reflecting black excellence. Those of us who grew up in that era sometimes even chose our colleges based on A Different World, and understandably share a nostalgia about the show because it pushed boundaries we hadn\u2019t seen before on television.\n\nSo when I heard that actress Yara Shahidi was starring in a Black-ish spinoff, I instinctively hoped that Grown-ish would be A Different World 2.0. And in many ways, Grown-ish is its spiritual successor; it\u2019s a spinoff from a popular black sitcom that focuses on the hip, stylish, too-cool-for-high-school daughter and her foray into college\u2014minus the HBCU (which is not an insignificant detail).\n\nOf course, like any good black Gen Xer, I spent a month or so binging on ADW as a primer for Grown-ish, and I can say with few exceptions, it still holds up. The most poignant episodes, like \u201cNo Means No\u201d (addressing date rape), \u201cA World Alike\u201d (about divestment from the South African apartheid state), \u201cIf I Should Die Before I Wake\u201d (on HIV/AIDS), \u201cMs. Understanding\u201d (our first glimpse of Hotep Nation) and \u201cCat\u2019s In the Cradle\u201d (the infamous racism episode) still feel especially fresh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact is, for a certain demographic of black folks, ADW is canon. I think to pre-emptively compare it to Grown-ish understandably draws ire. In a list of the most influential black shows, it reliably lands in the top 10, if not top 3. And though I agree with the writer of the controversial article in The Undefeated that by today\u2019s standards, ADW feels \u201csafe,\u201d it wasn\u2019t safe in its day. We have to remember\u2014and respect\u2014that ADW was a show that deeply influenced a generation of black Xers (myself included), and that\u2019s just real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the bigger reality is that we also can\u2019t hold Grown-ish to the standard ADW set for us as Gen Xers\u2014the first two episodes alone are a wake-up call that times have certainly changed. Honestly, we\u2019d be much better off comparing Grown-ish to the Netflix series Dear White People\u2014another show about millennial black folks in a predominantly white college\u2014than ADW. We don\u2019t even watch television the same way we did in the \u201980s and \u201990s; undeniably, millennials and their younger sibs, Generation Edge, have been regularly exposed to topics that felt edgy to us when we first experienced them on ADW.\n\nIt\u2019s also not fair to compare Zoey Johnson to Denise Huxtable, any more than Black-ish really compares to The Cosby Show (outside of the upwardly mobile black family of seven). Yes, Zoey is beautiful and fashion-forward and witty\u2014all the things we want our black girls to be\u2014but we are also watching her fall for a booty-call text as she pops another Adderall. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that her life won\u2019t be tied up in a neat 26-minute bow. The ADW generation are adults now, and as adults, the way we are watching this show will be different.\n\nEven the way Zoey\u2019s #BlackGirlMagic shows up is much different from our ADW faves. While it\u2019s tempting to compare her and her counterparts to the women on ADW, for me and many of my friends, those women embodied #BlackGirlMagic before we possessed that language.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI loved Jaleesa\u2019s strength and fortitude, Kim\u2019s mind and beauty, Whitley\u2019s confidence and pride and Freddie\u2019s youth and \u201cwokeness.\u201d Everything about those women made me think about what it meant to be a black woman. Even as a young lesbian who didn\u2019t necessarily see herself reflected in the show\u2019s completely heteronormative narrative, I knew that if I had half of what these women had, I could make it.\n\nWhat I do find myself hoping is that Zoey will give young black women a mirror for what #BlackGirlJoy may look like. Zoey, thanks to her upwardly mobile but racially obsessed father and her sometimes racially confused mother (I personally hated the tragic mulatto flavor of the episode \u201cBeing Bow-racial\u201d), has so far spent a life less intensely focused on her blackness\u2014she\u2019s been able to just grow up and live life. She is confident and, in her own way, quirky and naive. Zoey embodies an important quality that we want our young black women to have: an openness to the possibility of wonder.\n\nAnd though we should be careful about how we frame our admiration for celebrities, Yara Shahidi herself is a young black woman to admire. She speaks regularly on political issues and is invested in her academic career. She also embodies the #BlackGirlJoy we want for our young black women; we encourage them to be politically savvy, emotionally intelligent, and invested in themselves and their people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Different World will always resonate for those of us who grew up with it. I think that\u2019s why we hope Grown-ish and its young star Yara Shahidi will do the same for our younger cousins, siblings and children. They deserve to have the same thrill and the same hope we had when we watched our faves struggle, live, argue, pledge and find love at Hillman.", "keywords": ["world", "women", "worldand", "grownish", "different", "college", "adw", "isnt", "black", "cool", "im", "zoey", "way", "young"], "polarity": 0.125043446891273, "subjectivity": 0.4972915249002205},

She is willfully and dangerously ignorant, is either unaware of or unconcerned with historical context, and also seems to have no problem inciting violence against people protesting and brutalized by it. If Heaven exists \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 and what we believe to be true about Heaven is actually true, if she died today she would not be there tomorrow.\n\nShe is also young, petite, and very blonde; characteristics that, in tandem, are considered by very many people to be the three most desirable things a woman can be. If she appeared on screen and the TV happened to be on mute and you happened to not be paying much attention to it, you could easily mistake her for Kristen Bell or Emilia Clarke.\n\nThis \u2014 her appearance and youth and physical presence \u2014 seems to be incongruent with who she actually is. It's not at all, of course. She is, again, a terrible fucking person. (Do not forget this.) But everything America encourages us to believe about how terrible and dangerous people are supposed to look and sound (not like Tomi Lahren) and the type of people people who look like Tomi Lahren are supposed to be (not terrible and dangerous) suggests otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular strain of socialization also ignores history. Tomi Lahrens are directly responsible for false arrests, beatings, whippings, lynchings, and even executions. If you watch the footage of Ruby Bridges desegregating William Frantz Elementary, or Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals desegregating Little Rock Central High, you'll see dozens of Tomi Lahrens on the front lines, clutching signs, hurling stones, and spewing hate; their pretty little blonde fucking faces twisted, evil, and cruel.\n\nBut their looks have granted them the privilege of consideration. Sometimes even kindness. (And sometimes even cupcakes.) Because women that young, that blonde, that petite just can't possibly also be that hateful. It's unfathomable that they could genuinely be this vile and wicked. So maybe a conversation might sway them. Or an invitation to a show. Or a hug. Or a drink. Or a date even. Or a dick inside of them. Or, shit, maybe even having a kid with them might do it. It never does, of course. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. But that doesn't stop us from trying. (If it's not obvious already, \"us\" in this context is \"Black men.\")\n\nWhile both history and the present inform us that we should be impervious to whichever charms we believe they possess \u2014 that our lives can literally depend on refusing to be seduced by them \u2014 we still allow it to happen. We still want to acknowledge and engage them. We still want to be nice to them. Perhaps with the hope that they'll acknowledge and engage us in return. But all this does is validate them. It gives them credibility for engaging us; which, in the eyes of their friends and fans and followers, is effectively and bravely slumming. It promotes their brands and boosts their platforms. It buys them more airtime and unlimited bleach. It provides them an alibi for their hate. Because Tomi Lahren can't really be racist if she's getting drinks with Trevor and mean mugging with Charlamagne. Look how fun she looks!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when we allow that to happen, we're not brave. We're not sober. We're not attempting to find a common ground. We're not extending an olive branch. We're not being the bigger person. We're not taking one for the team. We're not even genuine.

Although packed with thrills and scares, it ultimately exists as social satire\u2014which, while not always funny, is a form of comedy. Also, this comedy distinction makes it more likely to win within its categories. For myriad annoying-as-the-fuck reasons, comedies, when compared with other popular movie genres, are generally treated like toddler siblings, while the \u201cbig boy\u201d dramas and action movies and psychological thrillers and sweeping period pieces get the bulk of the critical consideration.\n\nSo while Get Out\u2019s chances might not have been as favorable if it were nominated for Best Motion Picture\u2014Drama, its critical and commercial success\u2014plus the biting and relevant social commentary\u2014would seem to make it a heavy favorite for Best Motion Picture\u2014Musical or Comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let\u2019s forget about all of that for now. Instead, I\u2019m curious\u2014was Get Out more funny or scary?\n\nOf course, it contained parts meant to be humorous\u2014particularly each of Lil Rel Howery\u2019s scenes. And it contained enough jump scares and other cinematic devices associated with thrillers and horror to be considered scary. But which was it more of?\n\nI have my own conclusions\u2014which I\u2019ll share a bit later\u2014but before we get to that, let\u2019s list what would qualify for funny and for scary:\n\nFunny\n\nAgain, each scene with Lil Rel Howery\u2014whose purpose in the movie was basically to be a stand-in for the (black) audience members. He was basically, \u201cNIGGA, DON\u2019T OPEN THAT DOOR!\u201d personified.\n\nThe extreme placidity of each of the black characters at the Armitages\u2019. Not meant to be funny in a \u201chaha\u201d way but in a \u201cHoly shit, WTF is wrong with that nigga?\u201d way.\n\nEverything with Lakeith Stanfield\u2019s middle-aged-white-dude costume\u2014his lobotomized mannerisms, his clothes, his cluelessness with pound etiquette\u2014which would best be described as \u201caggressively Patagonia.\u201d\n\nRose Armitage\u2019s pervasive and consummate and insidious whiteness, best exemplified by the scene toward the end of the movie where she\u2019s sitting on her bed, browsing the internet for black athletes, drinking milk with a straw and eating a bowl of dry-ass cereal one piece at a time. This was the whitest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScary\n\nThe sunken place, of course.\n\nThe kidnapping at the beginning of the movie, which could actually land in the funny category because of Stanfield\u2019s self-aware comments to himself before he was taken. He was also acting as a bit of a black-audience-member stand-in, but it was too late for him. He was already doomed.\n\nThe several jump scares throughout the movie, starting with the deer hitting Rose and Chris\u2019 car (which, in the theater I was in, made a woman in front of me say, \u201cMan, fuck this shit\u201d).\n\nThe stretch where Chris is subdued and then prepped for his lobotomy.\n\nThe moments after Chris escapes when both \u201cGrandma\u201d and \u201cGrandpa\u201d spring to life and try to kill him.\n\nThe scariest scene of all\u2014to me, at least\u2014is when the cop car approaches after Chris has finished murdering all of those white people and their black help. Of course, it turned out to be his boy there to rescue him, but even I felt my fight-or-flight sense engaged when seeing that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer here depends on your perspective. And also, oddly, racial politics. I laughed more while watching the movie than I was scared. Even the \u201cscary\u201d parts were followed by chuckles of recognition. Like, \u201cHoly shit, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d I also saw it in a predominantly black movie theater, and my reactions mirrored those of most of the moviegoers.\n\nThat said, I have to admit that I\u2019d probably feel a certain way if I watched it in a predominantly white theater and heard laughs during some of the scarier/creepier parts. Like, um, y\u2019all don\u2019t have permission to be laughing at any of this! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!! And I imagine that many white people who saw this movie felt similarly and refused to laugh because they just weren\u2019t sure if the movie was allowed to be funny to them.\n\nSo my verdict is that Get Out was more funny than scary. But it was actually more creepy than anything else (unless, of course, you\u2019re white, which means you need to watch this shit like a documentary).", "keywords": ["scary", "movie", "best", "shit", "white", "chris", "funny", "black", "theater", "scene"], "polarity": 0.1145295467584624, "subjectivity": 0.5645821380761138},

For those not in the know, it\u2019s a spinoff from hit ABC show Black-ish that focuses on Shahidi\u2019s character, Zoey, and her journey from super-sheltered private school student to college freshman in this millennial world. Comparisons to A Different World will undoubtedly exist, but fuck that shit. We\u2019re going to let Grown-ish bounce, rock, skate and roll on its own merits, and so far, I\u2019m in.\n\nThe debut episodes brought me back to my college days\u2014kinda; we\u2019ll get to that later\u2014while also infusing enough blackness to keep me interested and anticipating future episodes. Here is a list of 10 things that were awesome (and black) about the first two episodes of Grown-ish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with the most obvious. By a show of hands, how many of you had any idea that the show itself would be on the Freeform network or had even HEARD of Freeform? Nobody? Good. I\u2019m not alone here. It wasn\u2019t until about 7:55 p.m. that I was like ... wait, why for come Grown-ish isn\u2019t showing up on my DirecTV channel guide on ABC?\n\nThen I looked it up online and saw it was on Freeform, cocked my head to the side and said, \u201cWhat the fuck is Freeform?\u201d These niggas just gon\u2019 make us LOOK for new channels? That\u2019s some black shit. Turns out Freeform is an ABC Family network or something. I was annoyed until Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast came on after and all was right with the world. Be our guest and shit.\n\n2. The first two episodes were titled \u201cLate Registration\u201d and \u201cBitch Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d using the tried-and-true method of naming things after black songs. I\u2019m all in on that level of blackness. It\u2019s a subtle way to infuse blackness that uncool white people won\u2019t understand without the help of a Magical Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Within the FIRST minute, we get footage from Freaknic (RIP), the freakfest that hit its hedonistic stride in the \u201990s, taking over and shutting down the streets of Atlanta every spring, AND Luke\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Rock.\u201d We just hit meta blackness.\n\n4. B.o.B. and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s song \u201cThe Kids\u201d plays in the first episode. Bobby Ray is a flat-earther, which makes sure to get some Hotep-adjacent nonsense into the episode without making it so blatant. Well-played, Grown-ish. Well-played.\n\n5. I appreciate how Randy\u2019s Donuts\u2014Inglewood, Calif.\u2019s famous landmark shop\u2014has become synonymous with black Los Angeles for all of us outsiders. It\u2019s been in videos, movies and television shows as a marker of \u201cHey, we in the hood now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Grown-ish, sister singing duo Chloe x Halle play Skylar and Jazlyn Forster, two track stars from the hood (running, not hair)\u2014hence the shot of Randy\u2019s Donuts. What makes this especially black? Glad you asked. They\u2019re signed to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Parkwood Entertainment imprint. We got Beyonc\u00e9 and Inglewood in one fell swoop, killing two black birds with one stone.\n\n6. Here\u2019s some extra-black shit of the \u201cFuck it, maybe nobody will notice\u201d variety: In the first episode, Vivek, the Indian kid who aspires toward Drakeness in life, is a label whore. That\u2019s fine; lots of us are. While they\u2019re showing us his label whoring, the show points out that his shoes are Adidas Yeezy 750 Boosts\u2014EXCEPT THEY\u2019RE NOT. They are Adidas, sure, but they\u2019re Pharrell\u2019s NMD Human Race red joints, an ENTIRELY different shoe. Oh, Grown-ish.\n\n7. They hit up a James Baldwin-themed photo exhibit. Two episodes into a show and we go straight for James Baldwin? Siiiiiiign me up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Zoey trying to knock out a paper on the Notorious RBG, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 1 a.m. and then 2 a.m. gave me actual nightmares. I recently told my boy\u2019s son, a soon-to-be high school graduate, that college was the best four years of my life and that I\u2019d go back, even with the work, and do it over. I think I forgot that \u201cdoing the work\u201d actually included writing papers again. I was NOTORIOUS for starting papers at midnight that were due at 8 a.m. and I NEVER LEARNED MY LESSON.\n\nI somehow managed to get a master\u2019s degree like this, culminating in a 50-page \u201cpaper,\u201d including a literature review, bibliography and fully cited sources, on how the government\u2019s HOPE VI housing program was a really good bad idea that displaced tons of black Americans in hopes of spurring gentrification because \u201cthe man\u201d\u2014that I wrote in 36 hours. What makes this a black-ass thing? I just mentioned gentrification. That\u2019s all I got.\n\n9.

I feel somewhat unqualified to critique Noah's performance. Mainly because I never was a huge fan of the Daily Show. I didn't dislike it at all. It just was never must-see-TV for me. If it's after 11 and I'm still watching TV, 9o% of the time it's a basketball game. So it's difficult for me to compare his performance to Jon Stewart's \u2014 which is what every Noah critique boils down to \u2014 become I'm just not familiar enough with Stewart's to make that assessment. (It's also an inherently unfair critique, in no small part because it's comparing a 2015 Stewart to Noah, not a 2000 Stewart.) That said, I thought he did a decent job. I believe he'll get better. And I also felt while watching it that the interview would have been more interesting if Hart was the host and Noah was the guest.\n\n2. This was Black as fuck.

Do black people own pearls? Aside from AKAs, I don\u2019t think so, so I will revise the previous sentence. Before you clutch your Jesus piece, allow me to elaborate.\n\nThere are definitely movies with more black characters or blacker themes (Friday, Do the Right Thing, Fruitvale Station, etc.), but Jordan Peele\u2019s keynote address to the Sundance Film Festival brought up the idea that perhaps no other mainstream film has so unapologetically exposed every facet of black people\u2019s perceptions of racism and of white people in general.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Peele gave the keynote address at the Sundance Film Festival Independent Forum on Sunday and addressed many of the themes of the film, digging in on how it differed from other mainstream films like 12 Years a Slave and Hidden Figures.\n\nPeele pointed out that the \u201cwhite savior\u201d complex that underlies many movies often gives white audiences an out because there is always a white savior who absolves them of racism. In their thinking, there has to be at least one good, nonracist white person for the audience to identify with.\n\nBut not in Get Out. \u201cRose subverts that,\u201d Peele said, speaking about the main antagonist of the movie, who masquerades as the protagonist through most of the film, adding, \u201cSometimes all white people are evil\u2014sometimes\u2014but not all the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery white person in this movie is evil,\u201d he told the audience. The director explained that before this one hit theaters, he couldn\u2019t recall any mainstream movie that ends with the black character killing a white person\u2014much less a white woman.\n\nPeele said that he wanted to use the horror genre to address the post-racial lie of the Obama era while having black characters do things moviegoers wouldn\u2019t normally see on-screen in a scary movie. Instead of frantically waiting for death, Chris\u2014the main character\u2014was intent on escaping, as the name Get Out suggests.\n\nWhile the flick didn\u2019t compromise on how it treated its white characters, Peele also wanted to make sure that white watchers could relate. His single-shot opening made white audiences experience what it feels like to be in white spaces as a black person, while translating the anxiety black people know all too well. He sought a balance between \u201cwhat black audiences need\u201d and \u201cwhat white audiences will be watching.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people would recognize that fear\u2014it\u2019s part of the black identity and the horror of America. There are things we are cognizant of because we have to be,\u201d Peele explained. \u201cFor white audiences, they see how it is to be a black man in a suburban neighborhood at night.\u201d\n\nThe themes of the film, according to Peele, had less to do with the individual white characters in the movie and instead focused on the idea of how violence was inflicted on Chris and other black bodies for a singular purpose: to steal, appropriate and erase the talent and abilities of black people because of privilege and greed. \u201cThe system itself is the monster,\u201d Peele told the onlookers.\n\nWhile it may not be the blackest movie ever, I can\u2019t think of another movie that enjoyed as much mainstream success and left black people cheering at how real it was while white people simultaneously praised the movie because it was a good \u201canalogy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides Boo 2!

But no one has quite come close to dragging him like actress Rose McGowan. McGowan was always vocal about sleazeballs like Weinstein, even prior to the New York Times and the New Yorker posting their explosive expos\u00e9s.

This was her way of shaming James Corden for triflingly joking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\n\nShe, essentially, went full white feminist.\n\n\n\nOf course, this was expected. White women historically and embarrassingly continue to drop the intersectional ball. But even with that being the case, there are some other reasons that the fact that white feminism is rearing its basic-ass head this time around shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. *That boycott* reinforced that solidarity really only is for white women.\n\nThis past week, before her horrendous tweet, McGowan was suspended from Twitter because of what some saw as her speaking out against the culture of silence that aggravated sexual violence in Hollywood\u2019s inner circle for decades. While she was reinstated later, cries to boycott the platform over her suspension rang out from a particular subset of Twitter (I\u2019ll let you guess who). The plan was for women to boycott Twitter for the day by not tweeting at all.\n\nI caught wind of this boycott Thursday evening (the night before) and briefly considered it when I thought: What sense does it make to protest being silenced ... by being silent? It sounds like some rhetorical circle jerk, but think about it: If the powers that be want you to shut the fuck up (especially in online spaces like Twitter), why would you do that? Why give them what they want?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo black femmes like me, it appeared to be counterintuitive, but also showed one thing:\n\n\n\nWhite women are often the only people who can afford to stay silent.\n\nThat silence was an option to begin with proved that point, but it also showed the immense cognitive dissonance white feminists display when they try to engage in matters of social justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, silence is often equatable to death. We go through enough silencing, suppression and harassment over our voices day in and day out (which I\u2019m about to get to). So who exactly thought it wise to tell us that we should totally volunteer to give up our voices for the day? Hmm?\n\nThankfully, our favorite social media superstar, April Reign, fixed that glaring oversight with an adjacent protest (#WOCAffirmation), but that still doesn\u2019t even begin to tackle the central issue many of us had with the boycott to begin with. Even if one were to excuse the method that was employed, there\u2019d still be one problem left:\n\nThe timing.\n\nIndeed. The whole reason I abstained from boycotting was the fact that I could not get behind the insulting transparency of taking up arms for Rose McGowan but leaving black women like Jemele Hill and Leslie Jones to be devoured by the wolves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth examples are painful reminders of what happens to black women who are loud and proud with their voices. Hill, a private citizen, was harassed by the White House\u2014by 45, the (unfortunate) president of the United States\u2014for correctly referring to him as a white supremacist. She was almost replaced at ESPN for her first \u201coffense\u201d and then unceremoniously suspended by the network for her \u201csecond\u201d offense.\n\nAnd while black women came out strong for her (as per usual), there were crickets from the same people who would have rioted for McGowan. No call for a Twitter boycott. No assistance from Twitter to stave off 45\u2019s attacks.\n\nBut that last part is unsurprising. Twitter has never cared about the harassment of black women on its platform. No, it would rather give us all 280 characters to waste and circular-profile pictures because why the fuck not?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there\u2019s no greater example of this than Leslie Jones. After accepting what she thought was going to be a fun and harmless role in the Ghostbusters reboot, Jones endured harassment for months. This escalated and reached a fever pitch when Milo Yuckyanduntalented intentionally went after her.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not gonna rehash everything she was called or likened to, but Twitter took no action until Jones herself retweeted and quoted-tweeted the harassment as a \u201cLOOK AT THIS SHIT\u201d tactic for someone to pay attention to.\n\nAfter days of the onslaught, Twitter finally (begrudgingly) banned Milo from Twitter. And even then, support didn\u2019t come for her until #LoveForLeslieJ was created by @MarsInCharge\u2014who is, wouldn\u2019t you know it, a black femme. And with that hashtag came the punctuation of an eternal point:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only support that black women have in this world is the support that we give to one another and ourselves.\n\nAnd speaking of support for black women:\n\n2. McGowan\u2019s limp, disjointed, two-tweet \u201capology\u201d demonstrates a profound lack of intersectionality and proves that she cannot be bothered with either repentance or accountability.\n\nThere were some who held out hope (I was not one of them) that even with McGowan\u2019s fuck-ass tweet, she\u2019d own up to her gap in logic and apologize accordingly. This is not what happened. Instead, we got a painfully underdeveloped \u201capology\u201d split up in two pathetic tweets. One quite frankly blamed it on weed, and the other was her apologizing to \u201cany \u2018POC\u2019 that were offended.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQu\u00e9?\n\nI don\u2019t know this \u201cPOC\u201d to whom she is referring. I really don\u2019t. You know why? Because she didn\u2019t further marginalize, minimize or Columbus the struggle of \u201cPOC\u201d when she made her offending tweet. She further marginalized, minimized and Columbused the struggle of black people. Specifically black women ... who, for the last time, live at the intersection of both (hello, misogynoir).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding McGowan\u2019s tweet, \u201cnigger\u201d is not a historical slur against \u201cPOC.\u201d It is a slur against black people. Black. People. Referring to white women as such is not only gross hyperbole but is fundamentally false. White women are not black and therefore will never know that struggle.\n\nEquating yourself to such because you have the misfortune of coming just below Chet Cheterson on the privilege pyramid does not a nigger make.\n\nPeriod.\n\nSo instead of co-opting the struggle of black people by making false equivalencies such as these, McGowan should have been preoccupied with putting in some damn work and finding some way to call out James Corden without throwing black women (and black people at large) under the bus. Again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since that didn\u2019t happen, since she used the specific pain of black women to make that gross analogy, that same fucking specificity should have been employed to apologize to black women.\n\nNot \u201cPOC.\u201d Not \u201cWOC.\u201d Black women.\n\nIf McGowan can tweet that shit with her chest, she should be able to apologize with her chest, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd make no mistake.\n\nWhile I greatly empathize with McGowan\u2019s pain and the pain of any survivor (which was well-documented this past weekend with #MeToo), white feminists like her shouldn\u2019t let John Lennon and Yoko Ono get them fought. Because white women are not the \u201cnigger of the world.\u201d\n\nAnd they never will be.", "keywords": ["mcgowan", "continued", "women", "boycott", "solidarityisforwhitewomen", "feminism", "white", "failure", "twitter", "black", "day", "poc", "weinstein", "support", "rose"], "polarity": -0.01231263067997762, "subjectivity": 0.41289792973466416},

When I checked it out yesterday, it was sitting at roughly 25 million views on YouTube, and as of today, it\u2019s nearing 30 million. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Drake \u201cgot one.\u201d The song is dope on its own, but the video levels shit all the way up.\n\nThe premise is this: The video has a budget of almost a million dollars, so Drake decides to do something meaningful with that budget and gives all of it away to folks in and around Miami. He\u2019s giving out money to folks on the street, at grocery stores, in college. He\u2019s out here buying cars (and hopefully insurance and gas money\u2014them joints weren\u2019t Passats), sending people on shopping sprees and handing literal stacks of cash to folks.\n\nThere are a few ways to look at this video. You can choose to look at it as Drake shamelessly tugging at the heartstrings of anybody watching by using his video to paint himself as a sort of hood superman. Much of the video where he\u2019s not giving away money looks to be shot in various hoods of Miami. For those folks he\u2019s handing money to, maybe he\u2019s just temporarily providing a salve when what they might need is actual help (housing, education, etc.) to get and stay out of whatever their situation is.\n\nTemporary help is just that; it\u2019s not changing lives for real. That\u2019s a more cynical view of the video\u2014that Drake is basically pimping fans he\u2019s likely never going to see again for page views and clicks. Shit, he (presumably) didn\u2019t even give away his own money (though somebody still had to pay for that video, which is not shot on anybody\u2019s iPhone).\n\nOn the other hand\u2014this is where I stand\u2014Drake is doing a good deed. A lot of them, actually. And you never know who needs a good deed in their life. Or who is $20 away from being on the street. Or for whom a simple $100 can change everything, or at the very least their week. Money, for the VAST majority of Americans, is a constant struggle. Help is help, however it comes, whenever it comes. I love to see good things happen to people. I love it.\n\nWhen Oprah gives away shit, I love it and I feel happy for the recipients. When Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired, I cried with those folks who got new homes and new leases on life because sometimes, just sometimes, you need some good fortune. Or Undercover Boss, where employees who show up every day and anonymously do their job to the best of their ability are finally seen by the very people signing their checks. When one of those employees gets rewarded, it makes me emotional. I really like to see good things happen to people, especially folks who don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember being surprised when Prince died by how much he did for people. There were stories all over the place, especially in Minneapolis, of folks who had been beneficiaries of Prince\u2019s big heart. Shit, you\u2019d think Prince literally helped out every single person he came into contact with. When Prince died, people happily came out of the woodwork to talk about how generous and thoughtful he was and how he\u2019d do whatever he could to help. And he did it all anonymously. That\u2019s how I like to live my own life. I help people out when I can and it\u2019s because I realize that when you have, it\u2019s a duty to help out those in need to the best of your ability.\n\nThat\u2019s how I feel about Drake\u2019s video. I honestly don\u2019t care about whose money he gave away or how he got it. I\u2019m just glad he was helping folks who clearly needed it. When he handed those stacks to that young man and his (I assume) mother, and they both broke down crying, I felt like Drake knew that while he was handing out money, he gave them something more valuable. I don\u2019t know how anybody ended up being chosen to receive money, but you could tell after they received something, their days were a little bit better. I was moved to tears several times during the video. And I honestly don\u2019t care if I got pimped for my tears, because that wasn\u2019t fake money he was giving out, and those folks whose lives he touched appreciated it.\n\nWhen people with lots of money and resources realize that they can change folks\u2019 lives with simple gestures (and for rich people, money can be a simple gesture), I gain an appreciation for them because it shows me that they get it. I watched Drake\u2019s video and I felt like Drake \u201cgets it.\u201d He went where he saw a need and alleviated some of it. For that, Drake\u2019s all right with me.", "keywords": ["drakes", "video", "gods", "finally", "away", "good", "right", "saw", "drake", "money", "shit", "hes", "help", "plan", "need", "folks"], "polarity": 0.1969121193134351, "subjectivity": 0.5550141452115135},

Year after year, our list of Young Futurists reminds us that age really ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a number. That group of 15- to 22-year-olds always impresses us with their tenacity, passion and ability to turn big dreams into reality. Here, we take a look at a few members of the Class of 2016 and see where their paths to success have taken them in the last year.\n\n\n\nJoye Nettles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Joye Nettles was a techie. She was initially recognized as a Young Futurist for her budding entrepreneurship skills at the College of Charleston, where she developed SpotIt, an Android app to help citizens of Charleston, S.C., find places to park. As a recent graduate of C of C, she had started working as a junior associate consultant at Thoughtworks, a global software development firm. Her ultimate goal? To open a school in South Carolina to inspire kids to pursue careers in technology.\n\n\n\nNow: Nettles is already using her passion for technology to inspire the next generation. In April 2016, Nettles launched Joye to the World with the hope of diversifying the tech industry and encouraging young people to explore technology and entrepreneurship. She has started the Mini Hackathon Tour, which is a series of events held at schools in South Carolina and Georgia, introducing more young people to the world of tech. At Thoughtworks, she was promoted to a consultant developer, where she is leading junior members of the team.\n\nRyan Rucker\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Ryan Rucker wanted to \u201crevolutionize the way people make reviews about everything.\u201d His first step toward making that dream a reality was his app Charmer, which he described as a \u201cfun and easy way to describe your friends and experiences.\u201d The best part? The reviews were just three words. \u201cWe are trying to make reviews like you see on Yelp or TripAdvisor, and we\u2019re trying to make them shorter, more simple and more mobile,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cIt\u2019s important for millennials to be able to share things\u2014and do it quickly.\u201d\n\nNow: Since being named a Young Futurist in 2016, Rucker has launched his startup Charmer on three college campuses: Berkeley, Harvard and Columbia. Most recently, he began hosting conversations about dating and relationships in the San Francisco Bay Area. The next session will focus on dating in the digital age.\n\nThomasena Thomas\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Thomasena Thomas was baking up a storm when we first profiled her as a Young Futurist in 2016. With FairyCakesSC, she would bring tasty desserts to her classmates and teachers within the halls of her South Carolina high school. She told The Root that it\u2019s important for young people to find their passion and to \u201cpursue it at any age.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat excites me most about baking is being able to brighten someone\u2019s day with the confections I bake,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a teenage entrepreneur is hard work, but I love it.\u201d\n\nNow: Thomas graduated high school in May 2016 and is now studying political science and communications at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. Since then, she has been crowned Miss South Carolina Pearls for her \u201cexemplary civic leadership and community service involvement,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Miss South Carolina Pearls, she has traveled to dozens of schools to implement the career and technology education program for students in seventh through 12th grades and has raised awareness around domestic violence and sexual assault, among several other initiatives. Thomas is also still baking\u2014she instructs baking classes for low-income students as a partner for Wings for Kids with Florence and Charleston County school districts.\n\nArielle De Souza\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Arielle De Souza was busy diving deep into some of today\u2019s challenges. In February 2016, De Souza was finishing up her senior year at the University of Rhode Island as a double major in ocean engineering and French studies. She\u2019d just returned from studying and interning in France to learn more about off-shore energy sources. Upon graduating, she was heading to Paris to complete her master\u2019s in maritime engineering.\n\n\n\nNow: Summer 2016 was full of big opportunities for Arielle. She won the French Consulate in Boston Excellence Award for being an outstanding student during her time studying and interning in Paris. She was also a lead engineering instructor for the Launch Math and Science Center in New York City, a STEM camp for fourth-graders through eighth-graders who were learning robotics, coding and engineering concepts. As promised, she began her master\u2019s program in France and is expected to graduate\u2014yes, within a year\u2014with a degree in engineering in December, and she hopes to continue her career in Paris. She and her sister, Annelle, launched a blog called The De Souza Effect, which chronicles their adventures as two Afro-Caribbean students who are studying abroad.\n\nYara Shahidi\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Yara Shahidi stole our hearts as the smart and sassy Zoey on ABC\u2019s Black-ish, which helped land her a spot on our Young Futurists list. But Shahidi proved time and time again that she wasn\u2019t just another young actress. She was outspoken about issues that affect the black community and wanted to make sure she cultivated her career as much as possible in the roles that she took on. \u201cBefore I auditioned for Black-ish, I received scripts that portrayed black people in a negative and stereotypical way,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cBut Black-ish is a more positive portrayal of what it\u2019s like to be black in America.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow: Shahidi is still warming our hearts every week as Zoey on ABC\u2019s Black-ish. On cable network Freeform, Shahidi will reprise her role as smart and witty Zoey on her own spinoff show, Grown-ish, where viewers will follow her through college life. The series is set to premiere in January.\n\nShe was recently named as one of Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 in Hollywood. She continues to speak out on race and social justice issues and was recently awarded the Young, Gifted and Black Award at the 2017 BET Awards. In 2018 Shahidi will join the incoming freshman class at Harvard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJewell Jones\n\nThen: Jewell Jones was simply hoping to make big changes for his city of Inkster, Mich., in February 2016. He had recently been elected as a City Council member and hoped to revamp parks, improve roads and start to change the culture of the Police Department. \u201cI will be out there with our youth to make sure I\u2019m bringing up the next generation of change,\u201d he told the City Council on his first day on the job.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow: Jewell Jones kept his promise to us. In February 2016, he vowed to \u201ckeep on running\u201d for elected office. Then, on Jan. 1, he became Michigan\u2019s youngest elected representative. Jones, who is now 22 years old, recently sponsored a bill that would withhold funds from schools that use racially insensitive mascots, logos or insignias.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: We included Simone Biles on our Young Futurists list just a few months before she dominated at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The then 19-year-old also had won 14 world-championship medals, 10 of those medals gold\u2014the most won by a female gymnast, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nNow: As expected, Simone Biles killed it at the Rio de Janeiro Games. She was the all-around champion in the women\u2019s individual competition for gymnastics, becoming the second black woman to do so, after Gabby Douglas. Earlier in November, Biles returned to the mat for the first time in more than a year. She is also a spokeswoman for Girls on the Run, an organization that seeks to inspire girls to run and gain self-confidence.", "keywords": ["world", "carolina", "south", "school", "changing", "told", "2016", "black", "shahidi", "studying", "recently", "futurists", "young"], "polarity": 0.13964610389610388, "subjectivity": 0.39927869605142324},

That black brilliance has touched and shaped all facets of American society\u2014in entertainment, the arts, sports, media, politics, business, and science and technology.

The album is packed with R&B songs\u2014like \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d and \u201cF.U.B.U.\u201d\u2014that sonically whisper; yet beneath those graceful notes are politically potent lyrics that roar with a sense of empowerment, independence and identity.\n\nThe album peaked at No. 1 on the music charts, which put Solange and big sis Beyonc\u00e9 (who is also on the list at No. 11) in the rarefied class of siblings who have had No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 chart in the same calendar year.\n\n\n\nIn a year in which the media has been perpetually under siege, we also pay tribute to the black journalists and commentators who fearlessly continue to speak truth to power: journalists like Yamiche Alcindor (13), who covers politics and social justice for the New York Times; Angela Rye (19), whose biting political commentary on CNN has left a river of conservative white tears in its wake; the dynamic duo of Ta-Nehisi Coates (5) and Vann R. Newkirk II (65), who use their platforms at The Atlantic to challenge those in power who are only interested in maintaining white supremacy; Nikole Hannah-Jones (50), who co-founded an organization to ensure that the next generation of investigative journalists includes people of color; and Wesley Lowery (87), whose award-winning book detailing the uprising in Ferguson, Mo., is being developed into a television series.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe would be remiss if we did not give praise to the creative geniuses behind Moonlight, the Academy Awards\u2019 best picture of the year. Director Barry Jenkins (3) and screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (15)\u2014who both won Oscars for best adapted screenplay based on McCraney\u2019s play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue\u2014along with heartfelt performances by actors Trevante Rhodes (43) and Andr\u00e9 Holland (74), delivered a coming-of-age tale that deeply touched our souls, while cinematographer Bradford Young (21) and film editor Joi McMillon (49) both made history with Academy Award nominations in their respective fields.\n\n\n\nSome of the sports figures on our list shouldn\u2019t be too surprising: Golden State Warriors Kevin Durant (24) and Stephen Curry (26), who took down LeBron James\u2019 (35) Cleveland Cavaliers in an NBA Finals for the ages. But for a second year in a row, we\u2019ve included Colin Kaepernick (17) because he sacrificed his livelihood while simply demanding equal justice for black people. His act served as inspiration for brothers Michael and Martellus Bennett (45 and 55, respectively), who\u2019ve assumed the mantle of Kaepernick\u2019s cause, which continues to spread like a wildfire through the NFL.\n\nOthers on our list include S. Lee Merritt (8), who has become the \u201cpeople\u2019s lawyer\u201d by representing victims of police brutality; Bozoma Saint John (10), who has been charged with rehabilitating the toxic image of ride-hailing firm Uber; activist Tamika D.

On Sunday afternoon, the actress posted a note on Twitter asking anyone who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to write \u201cMe too\u201d in response.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the tweet had more than 35,000 direct responses.\n\nThe campaign follows a week where disgraced Hollywood exec Harvey Weinstein\u2019s years of alleged sexual abuse and predatory behavior dominated headlines.

Some users detailed their experiences with harassment and assault, while other simply left it at \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers were critical of the hashtag.\n\n\u201cIf you are able to say \u2018Me too,\u2019 please do and spread visibility! But to the white / cis people / cis women out there: don\u2019t dare go demanding it from others, especially not from Black & POC women & femmes & especially not from trans & non-binary people,\u201d wrote AC Dumlao, an artist and activist, on their social-justice Facebook account.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsider that you are not necessarily trusted if it took Rose McGowan\u2019s Twitter expulsion to activate your activism,\u201d advised Dumlao. \u201cConsider privilege when it comes to who is able to come forward and be believed first.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was echoed elsewhere on social media, since some people found the campaign to be exploitative. \u201cWhy must survivors dredge up our pain and put it on display just to get people to care about sexual harassment and sexual assault,\u201d posted one Twitter user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time that such a campaign has rippled across social media. The campaigns #YesAllWomen in 2014, #YouOkSis and #EverdaySexism from 2012 all relied on victims\u2019 narratives and affirmations to highlight how widespread and common harassment and assault are.\n\nSpeaking personally, the effect was devastating. I know the statistics. I know that many of my friends have encountered sexual harassment or abuse\u2014many of them multiple times. I know I have experienced it. And still, the flood of people confirming their experiences\u2014from childhood friends to former co-workers to family members\u2014was dizzying and devastating.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was also the first time I had seen so many women of color come forward and share their experiences in one place. Often omitted from media narratives and high-profile stories of sexual abuse\u2014despite suffering from assault at higher rates than white women\u2014women of color were able to use #MeToo to express solidarity and control their narratives.\n\nIt was in this spirit that I shared my own experience with sexual harassment and assault for the first time in a public space.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember all their names. Some of their names I never knew,\u201d I wrote. \u201cBut I protected all of them. I never hated them for what they did to me. I did hate myself because I couldn\u2019t stop them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI paused before posting. I had never told my family, who follows me on Facebook. I had never told most of my friends\u2014certainly hadn\u2019t told them that I still think of the way I didn\u2019t fight back. That I was still mad. That still, years removed from the men and places where it happened, the memories would find me at odd hours: on the orange seats of a subway car, at work, in the still of night, waiting for a pot to boil.\n\n#MeToo, I wrote.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this article misgendered AC Dumlao.

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET. And if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast.

We have to make that clear. She is (more than likely) not running!\n\nOf course, she can if she wants to. Because she\u2019s Oprah, and if Oprah says, \u201cHey, y\u2019all. I want to do this thing,\u201d you don\u2019t say, \u201cNo, Oprah, you cannot do this thing you want to do.\u201d Even if you happen to be making Oprah an omelet for some reason, and she says she\u2019d like feta cheese, peanut butter and Frosted Flakes on said omelet, you don\u2019t say, \u201cNo, Oprah. That would be terrible idea.\u201d Because Oprah would make it work.

Well, if Oprah has no intentions of running (AND SHE ALLEGEDLY DOESN\u2019T), he\u2019s challenging someone he knows isn\u2019t interested in running against him.

Given the feats of everyone from James Baldwin and Billie Holiday to Ta-Nehisi Coates and Toni Morrison, the need to validate black stories becomes downright baffling.\n\nThe debut Saturday on HBO of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, backed by and starring Oprah Winfrey, speaks to this conundrum: While Winfrey is a media giant and perhaps, along with Shonda Rhimes, the most powerful woman of color in media, it was white journalist Rebecca Skloot\u2019s version of Lacks\u2019 exploitation that became a best-selling book\u2014not the one written in 2008 by PEN Oakland award-winning African-American writer Harriet Washington (Medical Apartheid), whose work also won a National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkloot\u2019s well-meaning and best-selling attempt to tell the story of Lacks, a black woman whose death from cancer also led to the use of those defiantly persistent cancerous cells for medical breakthroughs, still leaves The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, as Ta-Nehisi Coates points out, lacking.\n\nYes, most everything Winfrey touches turns to gold, so the small-screen version of the book may also prove successful. In addition, if you consider the financial successes of the hip-hop musical Hamilton, the horror flick Get Out, and Lynn Nottage\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, and Tony Award contender, Sweat, the disconnection of the value of black stories to the universal narrative seems inexplicable.\n\nWhile all of these stories, with the exception of Hamilton, can be considered \u201cblack\u201d stories, their collective impressive successes with nonblack audiences indicate that they resonate with a wide range of audiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a Northwestern University professor who researches, teaches and publishes on minority art, I have found that minority voices often tend to tell richer and more inclusive stories.\n\nIn Physics of Blackness, I write that rather than being \u201cniche,\u201d the best minority art shows how we are all webbed together, in both nuanced and obvious ways.\n\nNottage\u2019s Sweat has been astounding critics with its prescient understanding of the economic forces that led not only to the rise of Donald Trump but also to the current complexity of our sociopolitical\u2014and multicultural\u2014landscape. Whereas many pundits and politicians have incorrectly focused on working-class white men as the central actors in the recession, Sweat demonstrates that the economy actually connects all of us even as it seems to drive us apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorks like Sweat correct, I hope, the many ways that black bodies are misused by white artists, in which the complexity of our humanity is frozen into a simple symbolism of victimization, and we are meant to be pitied, perhaps wept over, but always viewed, somehow, as \u201cother.\u201d\n\nFor example, Dana Schutz\u2019s recent submission for the Whitney Biennial, Open Casket\u2014a painting based on the open-casket photograph of Emmett Till\u2014says more about racial blindness and white privilege than the racial story of the United States.\n\n\n\nIn both the book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks and Open Casket, the black body is a corpse, a tool for an argument being made by the white auteur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast, Hamilton imparts an incredibly complex history of the formation of the United States, embracing racial and gendered issues and all of their paradoxes.\n\nTo be sure, Hamilton does not tell everyone\u2019s story when it comes to the U.S. colonial history\u2014most painfully and ironically, that of the Native Americans; and yet, despite its flaws, what Hamilton forcefully argues is that the story of this nation cannot be told today without a central minority presence, as seemingly counterintuitive as that seems.\n\nIn his 1926 essay \u201cThe Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\u201d Langston Hughes wrote: \u201cWe younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn\u2019t matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too.\u201d How stunning that nearly a century later, those words must still stand as our battle cry against an establishment that continues to question our ability to tell our stories\u2014and, really, the stories of this nation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nMichelle M.

But what happens when Oprah calls? The Glow Up asked writer Tayari Jones, who got the call from the great and powerful O in October when her latest novel, An American Marriage, was chosen as the first Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection of 2018.\n\n\n\nSo what does Oprah say when she calls to give someone life-changing news?\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018Hi, this is Oprah.\u2019 That\u2019s what she says,\u201d Jones said, laughing. \u201cAnd then she politely waits for you to get your whole freakout on. She patiently waits and then, when she\u2019s decided that\u2019s enough freakout time, she gets on to business.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbusiness\u201d is a major breakthrough for Jones, whose first novel, Leaving Atlanta, won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Crafting An American Marriage, which debuted last week to critical acclaim, was a slow and arduous journey, spanning six of the seven years since her last (also critically acclaimed) novel, Silver Sparrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t work this book out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chosen a project that was too emotionally and morally ambitious, and I couldn\u2019t work it out.\u201d\n\nHer journey began with a desire to engage more of the issues of the day in her writing\u2014specifically issues surrounding wrongful incarceration, which she researched extensively during a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard in 2011. But though she became informed, she says she didn\u2019t feel inspired:\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t spark me as an artist, and I think it\u2019s because when it comes to issues like wrongful incarceration, there\u2019s only one side to that story. There\u2019s no other side to it; it\u2019s just wrong. And something with only one side, to me, is not dynamic enough to support 300 pages of a novel; you need ambiguity, you need adventure, you need\u2014just so many things\u2014but I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inspiration often comes in unlikely places. For Jones, it arrived in a mall food court in her native Atlanta when she overheard a couple arguing at a nearby table. Jones took note of the physical differences between the two\u2014the woman was very well put-together, clearly doing better than the man with whom she was engaged in a heart-wrenching discussion within earshot of Jones:\n\nShe said, \u201cRoy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you talkin\u2019 about; this shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u201d... and I thought, that is really, in many ways, the heart of the African-American man-woman disconnect. He needs from her this kind of unconditional support, and she doesn\u2019t believe that if the tables were turned that he would behave the same way. And he feels like, \u201cThese tables don\u2019t turn, so it\u2019s moot!\u201d And I just felt like both of them deserved a full story, and that\u2019s how I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat that overheard conversation inspired is a beautiful and sometimes brutally honest novel about love, loss, hope, redemption, the secrets we keep from those we claim to love, and what Jones feels is the fundamental disconnect and danger facing black heterosexual relationships in a country so deeply invested in both racism and the prison-industrial complex\u2014and, consequently, the effects of wrongful incarceration on relationships, as Jones explained to The Glow Up: \u201cI\u2019m really curious about the residual effects; about what we owe one another; about the way this affects gender dynamics in our community.\u201d\n\nThe title of An American Marriage refers to the union of Roy and Celestial, an upwardly mobile African-American couple whose young marriage is ripped apart by wrongful incarceration\u2014a misidentification that Roy pays for with years of his innocent life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat ensues during those years confronts the reader\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about fidelity, obligation and, most important, love. It also addresses the paradox that can be created when the deep inequities in our justice system intersect with the double standards that often permeate our relationships.\n\nOriginally writing from Celestial\u2019s point of view as a prisoner\u2019s wife, Jones found that her character\u2019s choices and behavior didn\u2019t meet early readers\u2019 expectations. \u201cEveryone [was] upset at the mere concept of this book,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s so often the case when it comes to people looking at women\u2019s responsibilities. Any time you deviate from what they consider to be the norm, then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s so little room for her to be respected in her choices.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging course, she attempted the story from Roy\u2019s perspective as an innocent man behind bars. \u201cWhen I came at it from his point of view, it was more conventional,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel challenging enough, and that\u2019s when I decided to write it from all of their points of view, because you want your book to add to the conversation, not just reiterate a conversation that\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they story told through the lens of not only Roy and Celestial but also members of their immediate family and close friend Andre, who occupies one corner of a love triangle that has perhaps always existed in the couples\u2019s relationship\u2014a relationship complicated by race, disrupted by time and perhaps always destined to challenge convention, as Jones discovered in the writing:\n\nThere are so many novels by white women that involve women trying to break free of the bounds of tradition, but I realized that in the white women\u2019s novels, the man is not in any trouble. So when she frees herself or changes the terms of her marriage, or what have you, because the man isn\u2019t in trouble, you don\u2019t worry about him, so her freedom isn\u2019t tied to anyone else. But with the black situation, the man is in trouble, so that if you reprioritize where his safety is not the first thing, or his care is not the first thing or the only thing on your list, there are consequences, because he actually needs you. And that is what makes Celestial\u2019s situation so complicated, but it\u2019s what makes it different than those other books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the characters Jones has created are realistically flawed, there are no true villains in An American Marriage, only different interpretations of a tragic situation. That ambiguity is what makes the narrative so intriguing from start to finish\u2014though Jones almost didn\u2019t finish, finding herself \u201cstranded\u201d 50 pages from the end. She even began considering career paths other than her role as a professor at Rutgers University because \u201cthree-quarters of a book is the same as no book at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the shore, and I could not get there. Like, someone had stolen my oar, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough An American Marriage is Jones\u2019 fourth published work, she is very clear on the fact that the writing process is overwhelming, especially if you aren\u2019t able to dedicate yourself to it full time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey always tell writers, \u2018Oh, you should write every day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that people need to stop saying that, because I feel that it\u2019s discouraging to busy people\u2014you know, to people who work\u2014working people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones wrote her first book on a desk in her clothes closet\u2014with the clothes still hanging there. She stresses that patience is key: \u201cIf you can put in an hour three times a week, you can write your book. It\u2019ll take you longer, but I just think it\u2019s consistency, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nJones should know; An American Marriage is a six-year labor of love that is well-deserving of the mounting accolades it\u2019s receiving. But it\u2019s a triumph Jones readily shares with the community that has sustained her throughout her writing career:\n\nYou know what has been really delightful about this experience? You know, I\u2019ve been writing a long time, and it\u2019s been beautiful to share this with the people who were reading me all the time. I feel like we did this together. I feel like this victory is ours together. Black women, we don\u2019t throw our people away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as we ended our conversation, Jones also made sure to share the words of her longtime mentor, acclaimed writer and playwright Pearl Cleage:", "keywords": ["man", "novel", "love", "heart", "jones", "book", "thats", "american", "gets", "matter", "tayari", "marriage", "didnt", "know"], "polarity": 0.11714598997493736, "subjectivity": 0.5294200779727095},

I forgot exactly what he said and how he said it, but I remember being reminded of exactly how young he is, and how surprised I was by that. He's been in the public consciousness for over two decades now; long enough to have several popular stand-up performances, 26 (!) credited film and movie roles, an iconic sketch show, perhaps the best block party ever, and a decade-long sabbatical from the public eye. I assumed that he was nearing or perhaps even past 50. But he's 43 years old; just five years older than me.\n\nUndoubtedly, my assumptions were also influenced by Chappelle's signature laconicness. Even when younger, he carried himself, moved, and spoke with the slyness of someone who's been here before. Who's seen everything there is to be seen, and mines his humor from the absurdity and the silliness of the human condition. If Chris Rock was the fiery and profane academic, Chappelle was the perpetually bemused and occasionally inappropriate homeboy.\n\nAnd perhaps this juxtaposition of his actual age and his decades-long celebrity status is why, after watching his special, Chappelle today feels like such an anachronism. This, by the way, doesn't mean that his special wasn't funny. Because it was. But I couldn't help but wonder why, when releasing his first concert special in 12 years \u2014 and releasing said special during a time rife with an ever-growing morass of racial and political context to lend his signature insights to \u2014 he'd devote the longest and most ambitious bits of his act to rape, O.J. Simpson, Bill Cosby, and trans people. Perhaps he intended to tackle those subjects as a challenge; attempting to find the humor in content most other comedians would consider radioactive. But maybe he recognizes himself as someone whose time has passed while other, younger comedians have taken his place. And perhaps he's aware he might be regarded that way, and is pissed about it, and choosing to delve into those topics is a middle finger to 2017. Maybe the world has moved on, but he hasn't.\n\nIf this is true, his bizarre and one-sided feud with Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele makes more sense. But it being (somewhat) understandable doesn't make it right. The source of his acrimony seems to stem from Key & Peele debuting on Comedy Central seven years after The Chappelle Show ended. As Chappelle recently stated in an interview with CBS This Morning, he (rightly) believes he helped pave the way for their success. And this bothers him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I watch \u2018Key & Peele\u2019 and I see they\u2019re doing a format that I created, and at the end of the show, it says, \u2018Created by Key & Peele,\u2019 that hurts my feelings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also alludes to this during his comedy special, joking that he's forced to (paraphrasing) \"fucking watch Key & Peele do my show every week.\" Of course, there are several obvious parallels between the two. Particularly in regard to the focus on race and racism. But how they treat and tackle race is where they're most divergent.\n\nLike his stand-up, Chappelle's race humor came from a preternaturally confident understanding of how the world really works and his place in it. He tells it like it is, even if its uncomfortable to hear. Especially if it's uncomfortable to hear. His infamous weed habit, in this context, is a self-medicating way of dealing with the humor and the harshness of reality. Key & Peele, however, mine much of their race humor from the insecurity of questioning their place in the world. It's not a shame of Blackness; it's a perpetual wondering if their backgrounds and personalities cultivate doubts of their authenticity, and finding the humor in their attempts to quell that (mostly) non-existent intra-racial cynicism. The Chappelle Show dealt with what was happening in the world. Key & Peele dealt with what was happening in their own heads.\n\nNo skit better exemplifies this internal pressure to perform Blackness than \"Soul Food\" \u2014 which also happened to be the first Key & Peele bit I'd ever seen. Chappelle would never, ever, ever do something like this, because it just wasn't and isn't a part of his relationship with the world and with being Black. (This, btw, doesn't make Key & Peele or their comedy any less Black than Chappelle's. It's just covering the same cavernous and limitless topic from a different perspective.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if we go back to the similarities between the shows, Dave Chappelle's gripes still don't hold much water. Yes, he definitely came before them and presumably made their path much easier. Just as The Chris Rock Show came before Chappelle. And Robert Townsend and His Partners in Crime came before The Chris Rock Show. And In Living Color came before Robert Townsend and His Partners in Crime. And The Richard Pryor Show came before In Living Color. And while I'm sure Chappelle appreciated each of his forebearers, I don't recall any of them receiving executive producer credits for his show.\n\nUltimately, it seems like what Dave Chappelle wants is for it to be 2005 again. But he didn't even want it to be 2005 when it was 2005 \u2014 choosing to walk away at the peak of his fame \u2014 so why should we?", "keywords": ["does", "chappelle", "exactly", "humor", "world", "dave", "hes", "key", "race", "peele", "special", "way", "came"], "polarity": 0.08916856952571238, "subjectivity": 0.47318138210995353},

Tribal-governments should work with the independent media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, it is always important to be clear, I do not believe our elected officials are inherently corrupt, nor do I believe that the creation of this publication was brought about with nefarious intent. What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

And then also a compulsion to watch the last 10 minutes of Django Unchained.\n\nSometimes, when digesting, processing and assessing the absurdity of the day-to-day minutiae of existing as an American during the Trump presidency, it can be easy to forget just how fucking insane it is that Trump is president in the first place. That the dude with the weird hair and oft-imitated voice from The Apprentice and the dozens of girlfriends and wives and the gold-plated toilets, and whose name is a common synonym for a certain type of shamelessness and performative gauche, is president of the United States of America. And was voted to be president by tens of millions of people despite having absolutely no experience, no competence, no agenda and no platform other than \u201cI\u2019m famous and, um, racist.\u201d We made the guy who was the inspiration for the main antagonist in Gremlins 2 the leader of the free world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, a recurring theme in the pushback against Trump is a hope that the next election provides a return to normalcy. In this context, \u201cnormalcy\u201d would be an actual politician in the White House instead of our Stable Dotard. The thinking being that we (the American people) will have tired of this celebrity-as-a-world-leader sociological experiment. Basically, Trump broke America, and we need a grown-up to fix it.\n\nBut I\u2019m not so sure this is going to happen. If there\u2019s anything his election has proved\u2014well, anything other than white people\u2019s willingness to self-destruct if said self-destruction helps to preserve whiteness\u2014it\u2019s that our (collective) affinity for celebrity is the tie that binds us. Trump didn\u2019t break America. He broke the celebrity-for-president dam.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ve elected famous people with no history in politics to elected office before. But as president? Putting someone with no political experience into the highest office in the land seemed too far-fetched even for us. Even Ronald Reagan was a governor first.

DeMille Award for lifetime achievement.\n\n\n\nWhile her speech touched on historical racism and sexism, which are woven into the fabric of Hollywood\u2019s ethos, her speech transcended the moment, much like in 2004 when a little-known Illinois state senator stole the show at the Democratic National Convention. In fact, it was Oprah at peak Oprah; she was considerate, measured and gracious, and promised that America was headed toward a new day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe did all of this in a stunning, all-black gown (a show of solidarity with the #MeToo movement against sexual assault), and dare I say it, she looked and sounded real presidential. If the Golden Globes were giving out awards for best transcendent, presidential-esque speech, Oprah would have won. Hands down.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one who thought this; rumors began sprouting up all over social media. People were tweeting \u201cOprah 2020!\u201d everywhere. Internet sleuths were digging through Oprah\u2019s internet garbage to see if there were any signs that she was, in fact, gearing up to put a ring on America\u2019s naked finger (we don\u2019t fuck with the man in office), to make it official.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the message still isn\u2019t clear as to whether or not one of America\u2019s richest woman will consider a run for office. Shortly after her Golden Globe speech, Oprah told Bloomberg backstage that she didn\u2019t plan to run, but Stedman Graham (Oprah\u2019s longtime partner) told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s up to the people. She would absolutely do it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, CNN, citing two unnamed friends, reported that Winfrey is \u201cactively thinking\u201d about a presidential run, but unless both of those friends\u2019 names rhyme with \u201cBayle Bing,\u201d I don\u2019t believe said \u201cfriends\u201d of Oprah.\n\nI can\u2019t lie; I, too, floated the idea of Oprah as president, and hoped that it would mean, \u201cYou get a tax break, and you get a tax break!\u201d A longer look, however, forces me to one concrete thought: Oprah is not America\u2019s mammy, so please don\u2019t ask her to come clean up this white man\u2019s mess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one year the president has put his muddy-ass boots all over President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy. He\u2019s torn the heart out of Obamacare, without a sensible, effective, health care replacement; he\u2019s given \u201creparations\u201d to the top 1 percent in this lame \u201ctax reform\u201d bill; and he\u2019s emboldened white supremacy, all while getting the entire United States involved in a nuclear Twitter beef with the supreme leader of North Korea. Not to mention, his nasty ass eats KFC in the White House and doesn\u2019t even use coasters in the Oval Office.\n\nLook, I know that the idea of Oprah for president is a compelling and exciting idea. Could she be president? Of course she could! She\u2019s a black woman, and black women are all the faces on Mount Rushmore for fixing perpetually broken American shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut please don\u2019t hype this idea up. Oprah coming in after Obama would\u2019ve been ideal, and I think that she may have been considering it, but she was trying to give Hillary Clinton her shine, and I get that. But Oprah deserves more than inheriting a busted America with a broken economy, or the threat of a nuclear war, with an emboldened white supremacist army dressed in khakis and wielding tiki torches.\n\nShe or Gayle King (who would surely be her chief of staff) would have to have a sit-down with Kim Jong Un and Iyanla Vanzant to repair the damage this president has done. You know that she\u2019d have to get a corporate sponsor to donate tons of free swag to make shit right with the United Nations. I also know that Freestyle Taco Tuesday night at the White House would be lit, and so would the Easter Egg Roll, but it isn\u2019t worth losing one of America\u2019s treasures to try to undo the damage that this flagrantly white, white man has done.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Sean Spicer doesn\u2019t believe that Oprah has the political infrastructure for a successful presidential run. Not only is he wrong, but this is coming from a man who became so disheveled trying to cover for all of the current president\u2019s bullshit that he once left the White House wearing mismatched shoes. Besides, what political infrastructure did Trump have when he decided to run for office? Tweets about politics don\u2019t count, and currently there is an actual debate as to whether or not the current president of the United States is even literate.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOprah could win, easily. Because Oprah could pull the 53 percent of secretly racist white woman who voted for Trump. When those white women claim that they have a black friend, they are talking about Oprah. Those are the women who betrayed their own interests and black America, and those women love them some Oprah.\n\nI know that the idea of an Oprah-and-Sen. Kamala Harris or Oprah-and-Rep. Maxine Waters ticket is fun, but think about the heavy lifting that Oprah would have to take on and ask yourself: In addition to trying to get us to eat better, love ourselves more and inspire us to live our best lives, should she really be responsible for balancing the budget, pulling us out of our national debt and playing nice with old white, racist senators?

If not for the relentless efforts of such organizations as the African American Policy Forum, the Black Women\u2019s Blueprint and OKC Artists for Justice, Holtzclaw\u2019s crimes may have flown under the radar, which is too often the case when black women are victims of heinous crimes.\n\nThough I was thrilled to see Holtzclaw shaking and crying in court like the cowardly predator that he is, and happy for the women who did receive some validation in a court of law that their lives mattered, he should have never felt comfortable enough to prey on them in the first place. But this country teaches men\u2014with power and without\u2014that black women are disposable.\n\nEven with the unexpected verdict, though, I could not stop thinking about the five women who were told that their pain, their suffering, their trauma, meant nothing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could not stop thinking about Recy Taylor and Gertrude Perkins.\n\nRecy Taylor was 24 years old on Sept. 3, 1944, when she was abducted, blindfolded and gang-raped by six white supremacists in Abbeville, Ala. She was walking home from church with her friend Fannie Daniel and Daniel\u2019s son, West, when a green Chevrolet that had circled the street several times finally pulled alongside them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven white men forced Taylor into the vehicle at gunpoint; one of them, Billy Howerton, would later say that he didn\u2019t participate in the rape because he knew Taylor, the New York Times reports.\n\nTaylor, who died Dec. 27 at 97 years old, told her story to NPR\u2019s Michel Martin in 2011:\n\n\n\nWe went on to church and came back. A car running around outside of us, six young men jumped out with a gun and said that\u2014you\u2019re the one that cut a white boy in Clarkton. And the police got us out looking for you. You get in the car and we will take you uptown to the police station. And they got me in the car and carried me straight through the woods, but before they go where they was going, they blindfolded me. After they messed over and did what they were going to do me, say, we\u2019re going to take you back. We\u2019re going to put you out. But if you tell it, we\u2019re going to kill you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 2011 interview with The Root, Taylor talked about the loud silence smothering her pain.\n\n\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t nothing done about it,\u201d Taylor, then 91, said. \u201cThe sheriff never even said he was sorry it happened. I think more people should know about it \u2026 but ain\u2019t nobody [in Abbeville] saying nothing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sheriff, George H. Gamble, didn\u2019t say he was sorry because he wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nThere was only one vehicle in Abbeville that matched the description of Taylor\u2019s assailants, one belonging to Hugo Wilson. Upon being \u201cquestioned\u201d by Gamble, Wilson said that he, Herbert Lovett, Dillard York, Luther Lee, Willie Joe Culpepper and Robert Gamble (relation to Sheriff Gamble unknown) all \u201chad intercourse with her,\u201d but he insisted that she was a prostitute\u2014and Gamble sent him home, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe night after she was raped, the home that Taylor shared with her husband and 3-year-old daughter was firebombed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter that, they moved in with us,\u201d Benny Corbitt, Taylor\u2019s brother, told The Root. \u201cAt night, my father would sit in a tree and guard the house with a shotgun.\u201d\n\n\n\nEnter: Rosa Parks.\n\n\n\nDespite what whitewashed history books would have us believe, Rosa Parks\u2019 radical action on Dec. 1, 1955, was neither random nor spontaneous. She was not simply a tired seamstress too exhausted to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus to a white man; she was a veteran organizer and activist on a mission.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaudette Colvin, then 15, had refused to give up her seat on the bus to a white woman nine months prior to Parks. For daring to be free, Colvin was thrown off the bus and arrested, but she didn\u2019t become the face of the movement. Instead, she found herself shunned by her community, alone and pregnant.\n\n\u201c[Rosa Parks\u2019] skin texture was the kind that people associate with the middle class,\u201d Colvin said in a 2009 NPR interview. \u201cShe fit that profile.\u201d\n\nIn addition, as the secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, Parks was well-known, well-respected and an \u201cinherently impressive person,\u201d historian David Garrow, the author of Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, told NPR.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruthless disregard with which movement leaders treated Colvin should not be erased, as it mirrors how those deemed \u201cimperfect victims\u201d are often sidelined today; neither should the fact that Parks used every ounce of her class and color privilege for her people\u2014and, perhaps, to free a younger version of herself.\n\nIn 1931, when she was 18 years old, Parks was the victim of an attempted rape. \u201cMr. Charlie,\u201d as she referred to him, was a white neighbor who employed young Rosa in his home snd tried to force himself on her, and she described her feelings in detail in a letter that was discovered in 2011.\n\n\u201cI was trapped and helpless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was hurt and sickened through with anger and disgust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps Parks\u2019 personal experience led her down the path to becoming the fierce advocate for justice that she would become. Long before she set foot on that Montgomery bus, she had been fighting for black women who were raped, sexually assaulted and harassed by white supremacists in the Deep South and documenting their stories. The Montgomery busing system was the site not just of racial terror but for racialized sexual abuse as well.\n\n\n\nParks knew that.\n\nAs Danielle McGuire, historian and author of Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance\u2014A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power, notes:\n\n\n\nOther than police officers, few were as guilty of committing acts of racist violence and sexual harassment of black women as Montgomery\u2019s bus operators, who bullied and brutalized black passengers daily. Worse, bus drivers had police power. They carried blackjacks and guns, and they assaulted and sometimes even killed African Americans who refused to abide by the racial order of Jim Crow. In 1953 alone, African Americans filed over thirty formal complaints of abuse and mistreatment on the buses. Most came from working-class black women, mainly domestics, who made up nearly 70% of the bus ridership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParks knew exactly what she doing in 1955, just as she did in 1944, when, at 31 years old, she went to Abbeville to investigate the brutal rape of Recy Taylor.\n\n\n\nIn 1944, after meeting with Taylor and hearing her story firsthand, Parks formed the Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor, a campaign that soon garnered support from activists, organizers and writers such as Mary Church Terrell, Langston Hughes and W.E.B. Du Bois. Before it was all said and done, there were Recy Taylor groups all across the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chicago Defender called it \u201cthe strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade,\u201d yet it is barely spoken about today. Taylor died never receiving justice because two all-white, all-male juries refused to indict her rapists.\n\nIn 1949, five years after Taylor was abducted and raped, Gertrude Perkins was walking home from a party in Montgomery, Ala., when she was abducted and raped by two white police officers.\n\n\n\nThe officers accused her of \u201cpublic drunkenness,\u201d pushed her into the back of their squad car and drove her to a railroad embankment, where they raped her behind a building. Perkins was then dumped at a bus stop and warned to keep her mouth shut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosa Parks also fought for justice for Perkins, forming the Citizens Committee for Gertrude Perkins, patterned after the campaign she spearheaded for Recy Taylor.\n\nPerkins, like Taylor, never received justice.\n\n\n\nMcGuire, who details both Perkins\u2019 and Taylor\u2019s stories in Dark End of the Street, reported that authorities \u201crefused to hold a line-up or issue any warrants since, according to the mayor, it would \u2018violate the Constitutional rights\u2019 of the police. Besides, he said, \u2018my policemen would not do a thing like that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Taylor, Perkins\u2019 reputation was maligned, her life was threatened, and her attackers\u2014standing boldly in plain sight, shielded by their whiteness and badges, never suffered any consequences.\n\nJust as whitewashed school books didn\u2019t teach us that the 1965 state-sanctioned police murder of 26-year-old Jimmy Lee Jackson in Selma, Ala., was the impetus for the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, \u201cGertrude Perkins\u201d is a name that not many people know.\n\n\u201cGertrude Perkins is not even mentioned in the history books, but she had as much to do with the bus boycott as anyone on earth,\u201d Joe Azbell, former city editor of the Montgomery Advertiser, said during a 1997 NPR interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just two of the names we know and here we are today\u2014still.\n\nSexual misconduct is the second-highest form of police misconduct in the nation after excessive force. \ufeffAccording to a 2007 report prepared for the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, The Nation reports, \u201cRape and sexual abuse by police [in the United States] are primarily reported by women of color.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[B]lack women are routinely killed, raped and beaten by the police,\u201d wrote Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies and co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, in the 2015 report \u201c#SayHerName: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the 2018 Golden Globes Awards on Sunday night, Oprah Winfrey brought these women into the room. She stood before Hollywood\u2019s elite crowd and told Recy Taylor\u2019s story. She didn\u2019t just talk about the women who are assaulted on casting couches, but the women who work on farms and in diners and in academia who have all been silenced by too-powerful men.\n\n\n\nAnd while she didn\u2019t mention her own story of being repeatedly molested and of being raped at 9 years old by a family friend, you could see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice as she said, \u201cMe, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the intersection of state and sexual violence, you will find black women who are silenced, ignored and erased. That has been the reality for too long because we live in a country where our blackness and our gender have made assaults against our bodies permissible. As I\u2019ve written previously, systemic oppression has always been mapped on the bodies of black women\u2014whether that oppression manifests through state violence or in our own communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement, was in tears Sunday night because this moment is not just shining a much deserved spotlight on her tireless work; it is not just a moment for white women to confront their complicity in violence against women of color; it is not just a moment to disrupt the dominant narrative that rape and sexual assault matter only when the victims are young, rich, able-bodied, straight and white.\n\n\n\nBurke, who began her organizing career in Alabama and has played a key role in organizing events in Selma, has made it clear that this movement is built on the shoulders of our elders.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do this work without continuously referencing the work of Rosa Parks fighting against the sexual and racial violence that black women were subjected to,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that it is our duty to tell these stories. It is our duty to lift up our elders and ancestors so that no one forgets their names or dilutes their legacies. We are standing in a tradition of black women who fought back against white supremacy and sexual violence over 70 years ago and made it plain that there can be no black liberation if black women are not free.\n\nThis movement is for Recy Taylor.\n\n\n\nThis movement is for Gertrude Perkins.\n\nThis movement is for Claudette Colvin, and for all of the black girls who are shamed into silence because they have been told they aren\u2019t good enough, pretty enough or smart enough for anyone to pay attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movement continues the work of Rosa Parks, who risked her life chasing justice for black women in the Jim Crow South, only to have her legacy be distilled down to not giving up her seat on a bus.\n\nThis movement is for the five women who did not get justice even though, they, too, were raped by Daniel Holtzclaw.\n\nThis movement is for the young Oprah Winfreys\u2014born into poverty in the Deep South, molested, neglected and not expected to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis movement is for the black girls who, right now, are being raped and abused in their homes and in their churches and in their schools by people who claim to love them in a nation that claims to care.\n\n\n\nThis movement is ours.\n\nThere is no slowing down. There is no giving up.\n\n\n\nThere is no turning back.", "keywords": ["taylor", "sexual", "gertrude", "women", "mothers", "rosa", "parks", "raped", "white", "bus", "metoo", "rape", "black", "movement", "recy", "perkins"], "polarity": 0.04695361781076063, "subjectivity": 0.42208472479901055},

She received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her outsize contribution to entertainment, putting her in the company of Hollywood legends like Steven Spielberg, Robin Williams, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier (Oprah began her speech by referencing Poitier).\n\nShe called the name of Rosa Parks.

She bigged up the press, and then she took the children to church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times.

They\u2019re the women whose names we\u2019ll never know; they are domestic workers and farmworkers.

It\u2019s a quality that\u2019s immediately calming to the listener and connects you with her.\n\nThe Glow Up had the pleasure of catching up with Dandridge during her current run on Broadway as Papa Ge\u2014a riff on the Haitian Creole god Gu\u00e9d\u00e9\u2014in the revival of the Caribbean-inspired Broadway musical Once on This Island at New York City\u2019s famed Circle in the Square Theatre.\n\nPapa Ge is a major departure from Grace Greenleaf, the role bringing Dandridge national recognition as the star of Greenleaf, on the OWN Network. Aside from the gender-bending roles of this production, which also stars Glee favorite Alex Newell as goddess Asaka, singing the house down, Dandridge\u2019s embodiment of Papa Ge is raw, sinewy and very dark. Fitting, for the god of death. As she tells The Glow Up:\n\nPeople who know the show have real opinions and feelings about how it should be done, and it\u2019s been really exciting to see those people\u2014myself included\u2014come in with a fresh perspective. ... If you change the gender, you release it from so many parameters, when you\u2019re doing a revival. And all of a sudden, the role became fresh and new, and I just couldn\u2019t wait to dig into it and find out who this person was. So that was a no-brainer for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis production, poignantly set on a hurricane-ravaged tropical island, is strewn with remnants of a life once lived. The ensemble cast, which includes a child and a goat\u2014yes, a goat\u2014is living and loving amid the rubble, a stark reminder of our brothers and sisters in devastated parts of the Caribbean this holiday season. As Dandridge notes:\n\nThe audience walks into this place post-hurricane. Garbage is everywhere, and the remnants of disaster-relief care packages that might not be so helpful. ... But then we turn these bits of garbage into things that are helpful and beautiful, to uplift the spirit. So even subliminally, I feel like there\u2019s a sense that even out of the rubble, the human spirit and everything that goes along with it triumphing are going to be elucidated and elevated while we do this\u2014while we pick up the rubble. And it sends a message that we are not we are not stuck in our despair. We can rise, and we can do it by helping each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDandridge\u2019s own transformation during the show is transfixing and sinister, as her onstage scavenger hunt grows into a costume literally made of metal, hair, skin and bones. She tells The Glow Up that the transformation is as much emotional as physical:\n\nIn my building of this character, it\u2019s very much a broken woman who is so hurt and has been so devastated that she\u2019s shed everything and let go of her femininity; lets go of anything worldly and just lives in the earth and in the spirit realm in the conjuring ... you just see this sinewy, very from-the-gut primal character that is devoid of all that stuff. So I hope that in the building of a character and the audience going on the journey with us that they are not distracted by the costume, but led on the emotional journey of Papa Ge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us who are fans of OWN\u2019s Greenleaf, we\u2019ve also watched the emotional journey of Grace Greenleaf, a role Dandridge has brought to the screen with the same grounded grace (yes, pun intended) with which she seems to approach her life. She says:\n\nThere was a real sense of knowing and peace when this particular script came across my desk. When I read it, it just seemed so familiar, and just easy in my spirit. Sometimes, it takes a little bit of creativity and work to squeeze yourself into a character and really build that, so that you understand something that\u2019s foreign to you. I had an innate understanding of Grace Greenleaf as soon as I read her. ... She\u2019s very complicated, and very flawed. And I love that about her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feeling was apparently mutual, as Oprah claims to have known that Dandridge was \u201cthe one\u201d as soon as she saw her audition tape. She immediately asked the actress for a meeting, which Dandridge says \u201cwas the genesis of a continuing conversation.\u201d\n\nThe experience of shooting Greenleaf has also been a very personal one for Dandridge. She\u2019s working with some incredible on-set teachers in the cast\u2014like fellow stage-and-screen actor Keith David, who plays Grace\u2019s father, Bishop James Greenleaf\u2014but Greenleaf\u2019s plot resonates with Dandridge\u2019s own family, too:\n\nGrowing up, I was always in church every Sunday morning, and my summers were spent in Memphis[, Tenn.,] with my dad\u2019s family all day at our church, so my family is my barometer. And if it\u2019s hitting with them, I think we\u2019re hitting the mark\u2014and we always are. ... And then, on the flip side of that, to have those waves of understanding and resonance come back at me from the audience, to know that we\u2019re hitting the heartbeat of what we\u2019re trying to say\u2014it\u2019s deeply gratifying. So it\u2019s a win-win, and I\u2019m thrilled all the way around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area this holiday season, try to catch Merle Dandridge and the spectacular cast of Once on This Island at Circle in the Square.
