You might think that explanation is implausible, but in a radio interview with Romanski, the bubbly Kiss-FM morning host said that she was only aware of who Martin Luther King Jr. was because they got the day off for his birthday when she was in school.\n\nHow implausible is that?\n\nRomanski said that he saw the sign, took a picture and reported it to the high school\u2019s administration because he found it \u201cunacceptable and appalling,\u201d he told the station. The 17-year-old said that the school began checking the security footage to find the culprit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen news of the incident spread, the school district issued a statement saying that it was able to find the student who was responsible for the prank, and officials assured parents that the racist signs were \u201cin no way part of any school, project, curriculum, or initiative.\u201d\n\nWait ... what? Why would they actually feel the need to say that?\n\nWell, maybe because Amber Smith, who has two sisters who attend the high school, says that her sisters were called \u201cniggers\u201d and the school did nothing about it. Perhaps it might be because Smith recalled students at Franklin making a video for a class project on why it\u2019s OK to use the n-word with no reprimand from the school.

You might think that explanation is implausible, but in a radio interview with Romanski, the bubbly Kiss-FM morning host said that she was only aware of who Martin Luther King Jr. was because they got the day off for his birthday when she was in school.\n\nHow implausible is that?\n\nRomanski said that he saw the sign, took a picture and reported it to the high school\u2019s administration because he found it \u201cunacceptable and appalling,\u201d he told the station. The 17-year-old said that the school began checking the security footage to find the culprit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen news of the incident spread, the school district issued a statement saying that it was able to find the student who was responsible for the prank, and officials assured parents that the racist signs were \u201cin no way part of any school, project, curriculum, or initiative.\u201d\n\nWait ... what? Why would they actually feel the need to say that?\n\nWell, maybe because Amber Smith, who has two sisters who attend the high school, says that her sisters were called \u201cniggers\u201d and the school did nothing about it. Perhaps it might be because Smith recalled students at Franklin making a video for a class project on why it\u2019s OK to use the n-word with no reprimand from the school.

Donald Trump was not the most popular candidate for president in 2016. Donald Trump is so unpopular that he can\u2019t convince a Bruce Springsteen cover band to perform at his inauguration. These are facts.\n\nHowever, none of that prevented literally dozens of Americans of color from coming to Washington, D.C., to celebrate his inauguration Friday. On Wednesday I attended the Black Tie & Chic Gala, a salute to black Republican leaders appointed to serve the Trump transition and various positions in the new administration. The night was a microcosm of the black community heading into the Trump presidency. Some people are well-meaning, some people are misguided ideologues, and occasionally, people are downright dangerous to the health and safety of the black community.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the irony of a black Republican Trump event being held at the Watergate Hotel. During the 1972 presidential election, Republican Richard Nixon had a two-pronged strategy to win re-election to the White House: employing the Southern strategy, which entailed riling up white racism against black gains during the civil rights movement, and authorizing a break-in and theft of important documents from the Democratic Party, which was, at that time, housed in the Watergate Hotel.\n\nNow, 45 years later, you have black people celebrating the presidency of Trump, who employed a two-pronged campaign strategy of exacerbating white resentment against black people and a black president, and who asked the Russians to steal and then leak sensitive information from the Democratic National Committee. To be fair, Nixon got 15 percent of the black vote and got impeached for conspiring to undermine democracy, while Trump got only 8 percent of the black vote and faces no political consequences for being an asset to Russia\u2019s intelligence apparatus.\n\nThe event was held in the spacious ballroom of the Watergate; as you walked to the ballroom, there was a wall full of the names of black Republican trailblazers and a few members of the Trump transition team. The band played basic mainstream R&B hits while guests dined on chicken-and-waffles hors d\u2019oeuvres, burger sliders and lots of alcohol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all the low-key pomp and circumstance, you know what was decidedly absent? Donald Trump. Literally, Trump had little or no presence at an event that was supposed to be about celebrating African Americans who were going to work for him. It was almost like one of those \u201cnetwork marketing\u201d events where they don\u2019t want to tell you up front that they\u2019re trying to sell time-share vacations, but the staff is working the room telling everyone how nice St. Vincent\u2019s is this time of year. Except no one is fooled, and everybody already knows that St. Vincent\u2019s is overrated.\n\nWhen Armstrong Williams took the microphone, he barely mentioned the name Donald Trump. There were no cheers of \u201cWe won!\u201d There were no Trump-Pence signs, no Trump posters. I did not see one \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat or T-shirt. In fact, if you didn\u2019t read the gala program placed on the ballroom tables, you could have mistaken this night for a million other suit-and-tie events that happen every 15 minutes in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe room was filled with luminaries of the Trump campaign\u2014Ashley Bell, Elroy Sailor, Telly Lovelace, Pastor Mark Burns. Dr. Ben Carson made a guest appearance, in addition to GOP trailblazers like Michael Steele and J.C. Watts, who were honorary chairs of the event. What was striking, however, was that the optimism of those in the room seemed to be the inverse of their proximity to Trump and the White House. Those who were state-level volunteers or just Trump voters were enthusiastic about the incoming administration. Those who seemed closer to power were much more cautious, guarded and, in some cases, almost ambivalent toward our future under Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking to black potential staffers and campaign members about Trump was like getting the \u201cradio clean\u201d version of a Rick Ross album. Every other word is cut, edited, redacted or off the record. Nobody wants to talk, and whether that is out of fear, deference or a fleeting desire to snag a job, the result is the same. Which is not surprising. With a mere 24 hours to go before Trump takes office, very few black people\u2014outside of Carson\u2014have been given jobs in the new administration. Conventional wisdom says that if you haven\u2019t been picked up yet, you\u2019re probably on the sidelines.\n\nOf course, none of that mattered to the regular folks who were in attendance to celebrate their new president. I spoke to a 50-something-year-old couple from metro Atlanta (let\u2019s call them Gayle and Mark) who epitomized the mood at the event. Gayle had voted for Obama twice and claimed that she was a lifelong Democrat. In fact, she actually voted for Trump and then voted Democrat for every other office down her ballot. When I asked why, she said:\n\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I mean, Trump\u2019s a billionaire; I believe in him. Because he\u2019s rich already, he won\u2019t be influenced by lobbyists and all the money in Washington. He\u2019s just there because he cares about us. Hillary or anybody poor would be trying to get rich [in the White House]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen have you ever heard of a rich person who doesn\u2019t want more money?\u201d I said. To which Gayle gave me a textbook Kanye shrug. When I pointed out that Trump had been making deals to get richer since winning the election and had an unprecedented number of conflicts of interest in which his businesses stood to gain from his being president, she had no answer.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked her husband what he thought about Trump and his recent attacks on the city of Atlanta, he turned into Marshawn Lynch: \u201cI\u2019m just here ... I\u2019m kind of a \u2018go along to get along\u2019 kind of guy. She\u2019s the Trump supporter.\u201d\n\nThis was a common sentiment among black Trump supporters in the room who weren\u2019t really close to the campaign. They believed that Trump was not like other politicians; that, as one man from North Carolina told me, \u201cI\u2019d rather see him try and fail than Hillary, which was politics as usual.\u201d When I pointed out that a Trump \u201cfailure\u201d could result in millions losing health insurance, trade wars with China, military conflicts with Iran and a rollback of a half-century of civil rights legislation, I usually got a blank stare or some semblance of \u201cWell, if he doesn\u2019t deliver, we can kick him out in four years.\u201d Which might make sense if the voting rights of the majority remain intact. Oh, wait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I traversed the room talking to everyone from local GOP party members and volunteers to former \u201cNever Trump\u201d people, instead of a raucous celebration of victory and making America great again, I encountered a hodgepodge of idealistic, low-information voters mixed with party officials crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.\n\nThere were constant whispered stories of infighting among black Republicans, with certain names popping up repeatedly: redacted redacted Omarosa, redacted redacted and Pastor Daryl Scott; rationalizations about incoming Attorney General and longtime civil rights antagonist Jeff Sessions: \u201cWe might be able to work with Jeff Sessions ... on some things\u201d; and outright candid despair about former Breitbart white-nationalist-terror sympathizer Steve Bannon as Trump\u2019s senior adviser. \u201cSteve Bannon ... I don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s not ... I don\u2019t like that guy. I\u2019ve met him and he\u2019s not good,\u201d said one attendee, while another whispered, \u201cAt least he [Bannon] doesn\u2019t have much of an apparatus around him; not like Sessions.\u201d\n\nWe were promised food, dancing and music until 11:30, but the place was almost cleared out by a quarter after 10. People were leaving, the food was gone and the band was playing Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cStir It Up\u201d to a lone white couple in the middle of the room. It was almost as if no one wanted to pretend anymore, that it wasn\u2019t worth it to run out the rest of the night until the room rental was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some hardworking, well-meaning African Americans working with and around the GOP for the incoming 45th president. However, if the Black Tie & Chic Gala is any indication, they aren\u2019t so much enthusiastic about Trump as they are just hoping that Republicans\u2019 being in power affords them a chance to make some changes that they think are helpful to African Americans, which is about as encouraging as Trump yelling, \u201cWhat have you got to lose?\u201d to black people during the campaign. But everyone\u2014white, Hispanic, Asian and especially African American\u2014is about to find out.

I teach at a university less than an hour from Tulsa. Much of the trial happened during my finals week, so I made the trip to Tulsa so I could see Betty Shelby in person. I was able to get into the courthouse because I work in ministry in Oklahoma City, but really, I went because something inside me needed to lay eyes on her for myself. What I saw was unimpressive.\n\n\n\nShe was dressed in a simple business suit and had what appeared to be a bemused grin on her face. She impatiently slumped as she walked to the courtroom\u2014almost as if she had been inconvenienced by the death of this black man. Looking at Shelby, I was reminded of Mark Richert, the police officer who called Terence Crutcher a \u201cbad dude,\u201d and of what Betty Shelby\u2019s husband, David, said on 60 Minutes a few weeks earlier: that there were two victims that night in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomehow, she saw herself as a victim.\n\nLater that week, my iPhone text message alert pinged: \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d\n\nDamn.\n\nBack in September, Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was walking to his car with his hands up when he was shot by Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby. This incident was captured on video by both a police dashboard camera and an aerial video from a police helicopter in which Richert, a fellow officer who was overlooking the scene, profiled Crutcher and called him a bad dude.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelby went on 60 Minutes last month to tell her side of the story; she said that Crutcher \u201ccaused his own death\u201d by \u201cfailing to comply\u201d with her orders. She insisted that race had nothing to do with her shooting and killing an unarmed man. With tears in her eyes, Shelby had the audacity to say that she felt as if a \u201clynch mob is after her.\u201d\n\nEach time these kinds of cases go before legal authorities, I do something illogical, something I\u2019ve tried very hard to stop: I have hope.\n\n\n\nHope that they will see what I see and rule in a way that aligns with justice.

That perpetrator was verbally threatening and running toward a police officer with his hands in his pocket, but the police found a way to use restraint. Of course, the suspect was white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrutcher had his hands up while walking away from the officers and, as his sister informed us on 60 Minutes, was most likely putting his hands on the car as he had been taught to do by his father when interacting with the police. And yet he was killed \u2026 and his killer was found not guilty.\n\n\n\nMaya Angelou once said that when people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\n\n\n\nThe same is true of institutions.\n\n\n\nI need to stop putting hope in a system that was never designed to protect people who look like me.

He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well?

Even though they could find no evidence or substantial proof, federal agencies monitored black organizations and warned local and federal agencies to do the same because ... umm ... well ... did I mention the \u201cblack\u201d part?\n\nAccording to emails and reports published by Al-Jazeera (American media outlets probably missed them because they didn\u2019t contain Donald Trump tweets), the FBI was concerned that Black Lives Matter protests would turn violent after Micah Xavier Johnson killed five police officers in Dallas during a BLM protest in July 2016. The documents, obtained by a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Color of Change and the Center for Constitutional Rights, revealed how federal agencies began monitoring the activities of Black Lives Matter and other groups even though\u2014by the FBI\u2019s own admission\u2014Johnson acted alone and had no ties to Black Lives Matter or any other black organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a number of black supremacist extremist groups in the Dallas-area,\u201d one email read, adding: \u201cthe most prominent of which is the New Black Panther Party (NBPP) which has numerous offshoots.\u201d\n\nThe FBI even thought that these imaginary black supremacists were set to attack the Democratic and Republican conventions, because ... again, they offered no evidence aside from supposition and white-peopleness. One newly uncovered email warned, \u201cDue to sensitivities surrounding recent police shootings, the threat of copycat attacks against law enforcement exists. There is a threat of black supremacist extremists attempting to violently co-opt the upcoming DNC/RNC.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was the cause of this threat? According to an FBI intelligence report obtained by Foreign Policy (pdf), it was Ferguson, Mo.\u2019s very own Michael Brown. Apparently, when Brown offered bullets from Officer Darren Wilson\u2019s service weapon permanent residence inside his chest and head, he was really trying to incite violence ... by dying. The report states:\n\nThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans suppred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence. The FBI assesses itis very likely that this increase began following the 9 August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the subsequent Grand Jury November 2014 declination to indict the police officers involved. The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to deed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother Department of Homeland Security bulletin (pdf) warned law-enforcement agencies across the country about an upcoming Black Lives Matter protest called the Day of Rage. The memo warned: \u201cWhile the media does specify nonviolence and denounces the actions taken against police officers that were not involved in these deaths ... these protests are not safe places to be.\u201d It added: \u201cBeing anywhere near these protests greatly increases the chance that you could become a victim of violence. When the mob mentality takes over, normally decent people can commit heinous acts.\u201d\n\nThe memo was sent to military personnel and police officers all across the country. A former FBI agent and state law-enforcement officer who now works as a federal agent in the Treasury Department said, although he was not involved in the investigation, that the reports could lead to local and federal authorities targeting black groups.\n\n\u201cI have worked in local and federal law enforcement,\u201d he told The Root on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they were trying to do, but I can attest that any street-level officer would read that report and focus on black people and black groups. I\u2019ve seen it. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was only one problem with concern over the Day of Rage: It was a hoax. It never happened and it was never planned by Black Lives Matter.\n\nTo be clear, the FBI and Homeland Security have not publicly disclosed any connection between violent extremists and Black Lives Matter or any black organization. There have been no arrests. They have not discovered any evidence, plans or even private conversations concerning violence in the Black Lives Matter network of activists. In fact, the best way to describe these assessments is by using a term that comes from academic and scientific circles:\n\nBullshit.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s own data confirms that 2015, the year after the Michael Brown killing, was one of the safest years for cops ever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only have the FBI and DHS not provided a single shred of evidence to back up their claims, but their own data shows the opposite. According to a separate November 2016 report issued jointly by the FBI and DHS (pdf), white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 \u2026 more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d It is a fabrication wrapped inside a myth covered in lying-motherfucker sauce.\n\nBut those scary black people, though.\n\nRead more at Al-Jazeera.", "keywords": ["fbi", "warned", "lives", "reveal", "monitored", "supremacist", "protests", "black", "documents", "matter", "violence", "officers", "feared", "secretly", "violent", "attack", "agencies", "federal"], "polarity": -0.020869781559436737, "subjectivity": 0.447543165646614},

Wagstaff III, including reports and internal communications from the department\u2019s Strategic Intelligence Unit, make up the basis for the group\u2019s allegations that Clarkstown police racially profiled the group\u2019s members and violated their rights to free speech and assembly. The documents show that the police department\u2019s Strategic Intelligence Unit\u2014 established in 2013 between the department and the county DA\u2019s office to gather intelligence on suspected criminals\u2014conducted social-media surveillance on BLM activists and continued to do so even after the unit\u2019s supervisor was told by the lead detective in the prosecutor\u2019s office that the surveillance had to stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote, even when a lead detective told the police to stop with their nonsense, they allegedly continued on with this illegal activity.\n\nOf course, this is not the first time that activists have voiced suspicions or concerns that they were being surveilled; however, as Mother Jones notes, the documents provided in this case represent some of the clearest evidence yet that activists are not making this shit up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, in Clarkstown, the special unit made use of a \u201cgeofence\u201d twice in November 2015 to monitor the Twitter and/or Instagram accounts of activists. Through the geofences\u2014which enable virtual tracking of activity within a geographic area\u2014the cops (and users in general, mind you) were able to track the social media posts of a targeted audience within a time frame and to store and analyze the time and location of that data. A report from December 2015 detailed that officers monitored and tracked the social media activity of activists on six occasions.\n\nMother Jones also managed to get an email exchange between former Chief Detective Peter Modafferi of the Rockland County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the former head of Clarktown\u2019s Strategic Intelligence Unit, Sgt. Stephen Cole-Hatchard. In the emails, Moafferi writes, \u201cI mentioned before, you really should not have Black Lives Matter listed as a target of surveillance.\u201d\n\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg in the suit. The suit claims that Clarkstown police even went so far as to put snipers on the roofs of buildings during rallies led by the BLM group in the summer of 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe intention is to illegally surveil people with the hope that they can silence them,\u201d William Wagstaff, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, told Mother Jones.\n\nAnd aside from the obvious paper trail, the group seems to have a slam dunk of a case. In July 2016, Clarkstown Police Chief Michael Sullivan was suspended, partially because of evidence that his intelligence unit illegally surveilled a community group called We the People, as well as the local BLM chapter. Sullivan was ultimately fired in September.\n\nMother Jones notes:\n\nA special prosecutor had been hired by the town supervisor (the equivalent of a mayor) to investigate the unit and had uncovered evidence of improper surveillance targeting Sullivan\u2019s perceived political enemies\u2014including the county sheriff, a judge, the supervisor himself, and even residents who supported cutting the police department\u2019s budget. The investigation resulted in more than a dozen disciplinary charges against Sullivan\u2014who was found guilty for 11 of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in January, We the People filed its own lawsuit against the police intelligence unit, claiming that the unit had tracked the group on social media. We the People ultimately settled its case in July for $300,000.\n\nAs for the BLM group, it is seeking unspecified monetary damages, as well as a cease and desist order against the intelligence unit, whose reports are also shared with neighboring law-enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice\u2014which is probably a legit move, given bogeyman initiatives like the one launched by the FBI to target \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Mother Jones.", "keywords": ["unit", "lives", "calling", "intelligence", "spying", "targeting", "attention", "jones", "county", "accuses", "black", "matter", "ny", "group", "activists", "clarkstown", "blm", "mother"], "polarity": -0.010698824984539269, "subjectivity": 0.44775561739847447},

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership.

These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world.

They want everyone else in America to see us as a threat so that when we are killed with impunity, no one bats an eyelash. This is already happening anyway.\n\nIn a country that was founded on the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it appears that you can fully reap those benefits only if you are not black, and if you are black and want those benefits, then you need to keep your mouth closed so that you can have the illusion of getting them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new buzz phrase is \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d and since it has been coined by the FBI, we can accurately assume that this is COINTELPRO 2.0. It will not stop here. They are painting us with a wide brush and making us the enemy because we dare demand equal treatment and justice. They are already finding multiple ways to create punitive damages for black people who speak out against injustice.\n\nThey want to silence black resistance, so they label it something big and scary that serves as a dog whistle to a certain base. They do this while simultaneously normalizing white supremacist and white nationalist ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people wanting justice and equality is considered \u201cextreme,\u201d while a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., complete with torches, Nazi insignia and an innocent woman being killed, is normal.\n\nAs someone said on Twitter, all we have asked is for the repeated killing of unarmed black men and women by police to stop and for justice in those cases where it does happen. This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods. Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["isnt", "white", "lives", "fighting", "extreme", "bie", "justice", "narrative", "black", "way", "basic", "cant", "extremism", "human", "felicia", "attack", "killed", "rights"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

The FBI report was released on Aug. 3\u2014just nine days before a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign Policy obtained the report, which is marked for official use only. The document warns that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d pose a growing threat to law enforcement. In a particularly cruel and unfounded assertion, the FBI claims that police attacks on black Americans could spur \u201cpremeditated, retaliatory lethal violence\u201d against the police.\n\nFrom Foreign Policy:\n\nThe August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for widespread anger and violence, the FBI report says, concluding that continued \u201calleged\u201d police abuses have fueled more violence.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight. Because the response to Michael Brown\u2019s death was the first instance of black people voicing outrage about police brutality.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t specifically call out Black Lives Matter, the group certainly is the subtext of the document. As Foreign Policy rightly notes, 168 black Americans have been shot and killed by the police in 2017 alone. Law enforcement has killed 748 people in all this year so far.\n\nThat\u2019s 748 lives in less than 10 months, nearly a quarter of them black.\n\nMeanwhile, the report lists six total acts of premeditated violence against officers, including the shooting death of Dallas police officers at a BLM rally in July 2016. The shooter, Micah Johnson, wasn\u2019t affiliated with BLM but was reportedly \u201cinfluenced by BIE ideology,\u201d based on his journals and statements to police, according to the FBI report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move is the latest iteration of a long tradition of the FBI targeting and tracking black activists. The most famous example is COINTELPRO, which was created in 1956 with the explicit intent to \u201cexpose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist[s],\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s own documents. Then, as now, the people the feds are actually targeting were mostly activists fighting to advance racial equality.\n\n\n\nOr, at the very least, stop the government from ceaselessly, and with impunity, killing black people and people of color.\n\nEarlier this year, The Intercept reported that the FBI began investigating white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement in 2015. That classified document was crafted, notably, under the Obama administration, and warned of white supremacists\u2019 \u201chistorical\u201d interest in \u201cinfiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did release a report earlier this year that warned that the white supremacist movement \u201clikely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\u201d However, the new guidance on \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d draws a dangerous equivocation between a movement that is seeing a visible resurgence and one that seems completely conjured by the FBI.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy, this new guidance has raised eyebrows among the intelligence community, with one former official expressing shock at the report\u2019s contents.\n\n\u201cThis is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,\u201d the former official told FP. \u201cThere are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Foreign Policy.", "keywords": ["fbi", "launches", "white", "report", "20", "enforcement", "movement", "cointelpro", "targeting", "law", "policy", "extremists", "black", "violence", "foreign", "identity"], "polarity": -0.032507111935683376, "subjectivity": 0.4133005565862708},

The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words.

One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers.

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["notes", "white", "going", "listening", "school", "president", "teachers", "teacher", "violent", "remember", "victims", "house", "trump", "massshooting", "check", "care"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["killmonger", "help", "revisionist", "wanted", "panther", "black", "tchalla", "history", "riots", "cant", "know", "folks", "njobu"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

On Wednesday the president suggested that teachers undergo firearm training and then be allowed to carry concealed weapons inside schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd this would only be, obviously, for people that are very adept at handling a gun. And it would be\u2014it\u2019s called \u2018concealed carry,\u2019 where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them,\u201d Trump said at an event at the White House where students and victims\u2019 family members from Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., were allowed to voice their opinions about gun safety, Politico reports. \u201cThey\u2019d go for special training. And they would be there, and you would no longer have a gun-free zone.\u201d\n\nThen, in a pair of posts on Twitter Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI never said \u2018give teachers guns\u2019 like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @nbc. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHighly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A \u2018gun free\u2019 school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!\u201d he continued. \u201cHistory shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on: \u201cIf a potential \u2018sicko shooter\u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won\u2019t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won\u2019t work!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s look past the president\u2019s use of random capitalization and focus solely on his clarification about arming teachers. Currently, teachers make less than dog walkers, and this idea that trained teachers would be armed and ready to take down a \u201csavage sicko\u201d is stupid as shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that this president believes that Bruce Willis is teaching in all U.S. schools, and therefore, with special training and a freshly shaved bald head, Mr. Willis the Teacher would be able to take down the savage sicko.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s look at the said savage sicko in the Parkland case, who, surprising to no one, is a proud owner of a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. This savage sicko was allowed to purchase his gun legally because the fake president of the United States\u2014and the real president of guns, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre (which sounds a lot like a fake Match.com profile name)\u2014don\u2019t want tougher mental health or gun laws that would prevent savage sickos from purchasing guns, because then gun sales would go down. And the NRA isn\u2019t spending all this money to ensure that a gun-leaning Congress stays that way, just so that it can watch gun sales go down.\n\nNot to mention, isn\u2019t it strange that the answer to mass shootings is always guns? The president\u2019s responses to the recent shootings in Florida and Las Vegas are a virtual Oprah meme: \u201cYou get a gun! And you get a gun!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump and others in Congress are firmly in the pocket of the NRA and therefore will do whatever the NRA wants them to, he ended his Thursday tweet storm with a shoutout to the great people over at, you guessed it, the NRA.\n\n\n\n\u201cChris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey love our Country and will do the right thing.

The video of the 2016 shooting was not released until after Brailsford was acquitted Thursday of second-degree murder charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of this horrific act of state violence, there has been some outrage. Black activists, as usual, have sounded the alarm, while the #AllLivesMatter trolls have remained predictably silent. This is not unusual in the aftermath of a white person being killed by cops. We witnessed this two years ago after police officers in Louisiana killed 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis.\n\nThis time, though, there have also been passive-aggressive and intellectually dishonest statements that pass judgment on the Movement for Black Lives for not taking to the streets and protesting on Shaver\u2019s behalf.\n\nWriting for The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf stops just short of blaming black people for a perceived lack of mainstream media coverage surrounding Shaver\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaniel Shaver\u2019s case is instructive,\u201d Friedersdorf writes. \u201cHis killing deserves more journalistic coverage as a matter of substance and more activist attention as a matter of strategy.\u201d\n\nThe author also writes that though he finds the movement \u201claudable\u201d for focusing on state violence against black people, \u201cpublicizing and protesting egregious instances of white people being killed would do as much to advance its agenda.\u201d\n\nFriedersdorf claims he believes that \u201cthe race-neutral policy reforms that the movement advances are long overdue,\u201d but in the next breath, he claims that the movement\u2019s \u201cexplicitly racial focus has been alienating to others, including those who don\u2019t believe that racism is a significant factor in police killings; those who put fighting racism low on their priority list; and anti-black racists.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe author links to Campaign Zero, founded by Brittany Packnett, Samuel Sinyangwe, DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie (who is no longer associated with Campaign Zero), as evidence of \u201cthe movement\u2019s\u201d \u201crace-neutral policy reforms.\u201d He does this even though Campaign Zero does not represent the Movement for Black Lives; even though the campaign is not associated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network in any capacity; and even though the campaign has platforms that tackle white supremacist policies, such as broken-windows policing.\n\n(Click here to read M4BL\u2019s comprehensive platform, which is unapologetically not race-neutral and calls for an end to the war on black people, reparations, political power, economic justice and community control.)\n\nFriedersdorf focuses on the benefits of so-called race neutrality, and not the movement\u2019s explicit focus on the most marginalized, targeted and oppressed communities in this country, for reasons that soon become clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the piece, he mentions the \u201cdebate\u201d surrounding the veracity of claims that black people are disproportionately killed by police. He does this by sourcing an article from the National Review, known for being a racist publication, which claims that more black people are killed by police because more black people commit crimes.\n\nThe author doesn\u2019t want to dwell there, though, because it\u2019s \u201clargely irrelevant.\u201d\n\nNo, no, it\u2019s not.\n\nLet\u2019s make this plain: Black people are disproportionately killed by police officers in this country because they are black. That is not speculation. That is not up for debate. That is fact. It is fact that statistical analysis has shown that crime rates do not influence the rate by which police officers kill black people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016 the Washington Post\u2019s Wesley Lowery tackles the myth of black criminality being the root cause for increased police violence in black communities:\n\nA 2015 study by a University of California at Davis researcher concluded there was \u201cno relationship\u201d between crime rates by race and racial bias in police killings. A report released [pdf] ... by the Center for Policing Equity, which reviewed arrest and use-of-force data from 12 police departments, concluded that black residents were more often targeted for use of police force than white residents, even when adjusting for whether the person was a violent criminal. ... an independent analysis of The Post\u2019s data conducted by a team of criminal-justice researchers concluded that, when factoring in threat level, black Americans who are fatally shot by police are no more likely to be posing an imminent lethal threat to the officers at the moment they are killed than white Americans fatally shot by police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis does not even include arrest rates.\n\nAs The Root previously reported, New York City police make more arrests in working-class black and brown communities than they do in predominantly white communities, even when officers are responding to similar 911 or 311 calls in each of those communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack communities have been brutally and relentlessly tormented in ways that often seem unfathomable, and to even entertain the idea that police brutality and state violence are race-neutral is abhorrent. It is equally abhorrent to give such blatantly racist analysis breathing room under the guise of objectivity in order to make the point that a movement focused on the desecration of black lives must center white lives in order to be most effective.\n\nWe live in a nation where a 12-year-old child was gunned down in a police drive-by simply for playing in a park\u2014and the state insisted that he caused his own death.\n\nThe answer to that is not centering white lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a nation built on stolen land, genocide and slavery; in a country that has lynched and incarcerated black, brown and indigenous people with impunity, the audacity of anyone to slyly reprimand black organizers, activists and journalists for not spending enough time begging white people to see their own humanity\u2014in hopes that, in turn, the protection of whiteness will blanket us all\u2014is the most condescending and ill-advised analysis that I have read in quite some time.\n\nBlack activists are fighting for an end to white supremacy, the material ways in which whiteness poisons every single thing it touches. There is absolutely no redeeming value in a racial and political construct that, by design, empowers and protects one group of people while systemically dehumanizing another.\n\nThough we are living in a political zeitgeist where liberals are negotiating with \u201cthe white working class\u201d and calling it progress, it is not our job to save white folks from the very institutions they protect and pledge their allegiance to, black lives be damned. It is not our job to create space for \u201cthose who put fighting racism low on their priority list; and anti-black racists\u201d hoping that \u201crace-neutral\u201d calls for justice will activate their humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have told white people for a long, long time, that if they come for us in the morning, they will come for them in the night. We have said time and again that more white people will be collateral damage in a murderous, white supremacist system. We have warned over and over again that the house is burning, but white people continue to act shocked and awed when their loved ones are burned, and then blame black people for not abandoning their own children to bring back the hose.\n\nWhat else do they want from us?\n\nBlack people have put their lives on the line for this movement, and some have died because of it. Black journalists have lost countless hours of sleep reporting from the front lines and being arrested for doing so; some have stayed awake with tears in their eyes and rage in their hearts, amplifying through social media stories that mainstream media deemed unimportant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack activists are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, unable to bear the sound of fireworks because it reminds them of the sound of rubber bullets and tear gas. Black organizers are being surveilled by the state, and some fear they will be the next Fred Hampton.\n\nThere is no room for trickle-down progressivism in this movement. To suggest that black people are better served by focusing equally on saving white lives as a matter of \u201cstrategy\u201d\u2014effectively neutralizing the movement\u2014knowing the cost of protest and the heavy toll of movement work, is to show a blatant disregard for black lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Shaver did not deserve to die. The next Daniel Shaver will not deserve to die, either\u2014neither will the next Jeremy Mardis. It is up to white people to decide if their ignited desire for justice is greater than their apathy and, at times, hatred for black lives, because there is a movement already in progress.\n\nIt is not black people\u2019s job to create a White Lives Matter version of it to appease white sensibilities.\n\nIt is not our job to hunt for the morality within white people who would otherwise be content watching black people die.", "keywords": ["lives", "white", "movement", "create", "peoples", "state", "killed", "raceneutral", "black", "matter", "officers", "danielshaver", "campaign", "job"], "polarity": -0.045962101170434526, "subjectivity": 0.35431948452781753},

It became of interest in pop culture and media a few decades ago, in the 1990s, with educational pornographic films such as Bend Over Boyfriend,\u201d Laureano said. \u201cEven though this definition was made popular by a particular community, other communities and bodies have been engaging in ass play forever. Sometimes heterosexuals are not as advanced or pleasure-creative as they think they are. Where\u2019s THAT Queer Eye for the Straight Guy show!?\u201d\n\nLaureano said that pegging can be enjoyable for both people who participate, and intense and more powerful ejaculations have been reported by men who engage in it, especially if the prostate is stimulated, but she stressed that \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d are both subjective.\n\nI was curious as to who would be willing to speak on their experiences with pegging. I was interested in speaking with both black men and women who had engaged in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot shockingly, I found that more women were willing to discuss it than men.

The one black partner who did indulge her in butt play insisted that she only use her fingers and never toys.\n\n\u201cIt was his request,\u201d Ray said. \u201cHe liked getting his ass ate and asked me to try a finger, but it started from a very \u2018while you\u2019re going down on me\u2019 or \u2018while you\u2019re eating my ass\u2019 place.

Both identify as straight.\n\nThe first, a 35-year-old black man, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s something I enjoy but rarely get to experience. It\u2019s still considered as \u2018gay,\u2019 and we\u2019re still homophobic as a staff, label and crew.\u201d\n\nThe second, a 41-year-old black man, agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve tried it and love it.

She told me that while she likes pegging, she is not interested in doing it with a man who is not comfortable with himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less interested in a man that is scared or unwilling to express his needs and wants than I am with having a hard limit placed on anal play. I\u2019m more averse to it because of my own expectations and needs, but I support a couple pegging if both parties are comfortable and enjoy it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nKyoko, a 26-year-old black bisexual woman, agrees. She said that as a part-time sex worker, she has often had clients request it, but there is a stigma attached to it that she believes is partially the fault of cishet women as well.\n\n\u201cCishet women are complicit in the shaming, according to my clients,\u201d she said. \u201c[Male clients] tell me if they actually work up the nerve to ask or test the waters about anal play, they often get, \u2018Uh, no, I\u2019m not going to do that to you. Why would you want me to anyway? You\u2019re not gay, are you?\u2019 It seems to them that it\u2019s OK [for them] to do the penetrating and that women are more open to receiving anal sex nowadays, but that is where the exploration ends. I have several clients in their 60s or 70s, and that seems to be the case in my peer groups as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how do we break the stigma and let everyone get theirs?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big, bold world out there, and it\u2019s sad to see that people aren\u2019t getting the satisfaction they want from their sexual encounters,\u201d Kyoko said. \u201cLife is too short for bad food, bad whiskey or bad sex. Men and women should have the same agency in sexual exchanges, and if, after straightforward and honest communication, terms cannot be negotiated, then on to the next.\u201d\n\nRay said that we have to be open and bold about it, but she admits that even as she says that, there are still plenty of difficulties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there aren\u2019t a lot of spaces where people can talk openly or freely about their sexuality or kinks, but I don\u2019t hide my harnesses, butt plugs or strap-ons from my partners,\u201d Ray said. \u201cI try to make anyone who enters my space feel comfortable and safe trying something they might not have thought of before.\u201d\n\nSexpert Michelle Hope said, \u201cI think that we must continue to educate people about the deeper meaning of sexuality and how it\u2019s a part of the whole human experience, not just what happens during the physical act of sex.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who do decide to engage, a little advice.\n\nFor those who do decide to dip their toe in the pool, Laureano had this advice for beginners:\n\nDiscuss comfort, lube and desired outcome. This also requires understanding your body, trusting your partners and communicating effectively. Forms of injury could be minor tears in the mucous membranes of the anus, which may not be felt; some blood in the stool; polyps from longer-term play; painful/stressful bowel movements; amazing orgasms; strengthened communication; increased intimacy with lovers; and other amazing and human consequences of fucking like messy, smelly, sweaty things! If you don\u2019t want to be in contact with someone else\u2019s shit, consider asking them to do a warm-water enema before play. If you don\u2019t want to do that and still don\u2019t want to encounter another person\u2019s shit, this may not be the activity for you right now. You get to decide on your own boundaries!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you choose to indulge or not, the ultimate endgame is sexual fun and pleasure for both partners. This shouldn\u2019t be laborious but, rather, an enjoyable activity.\n\nIf you decide it\u2019s not for you, then it\u2019s not for you, but don\u2019t let stigma keep you from experiencing great pleasure.", "keywords": ["fully", "woman", "dont", "man", "kinkshaming", "keeps", "stigma", "pegging", "enjoying", "women", "bad", "black", "play", "butt", "men"], "polarity": 0.15580869432910252, "subjectivity": 0.5486988446172119},

It will not stop here. They are painting us with a wide brush and making us the enemy because we dare demand equal treatment and justice. They are already finding multiple ways to create punitive damages for black people who speak out against injustice.\n\nThey want to silence black resistance, so they label it something big and scary that serves as a dog whistle to a certain base.

This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods.

Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["isnt", "white", "lives", "fighting", "extreme", "bie", "justice", "narrative", "black", "way", "basic", "cant", "extremism", "human", "felicia", "attack", "killed", "rights"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

It became of interest in pop culture and media a few decades ago, in the 1990s, with educational pornographic films such as Bend Over Boyfriend,\u201d Laureano said. \u201cEven though this definition was made popular by a particular community, other communities and bodies have been engaging in ass play forever. Sometimes heterosexuals are not as advanced or pleasure-creative as they think they are. Where\u2019s THAT Queer Eye for the Straight Guy show!?\u201d\n\nLaureano said that pegging can be enjoyable for both people who participate, and intense and more powerful ejaculations have been reported by men who engage in it, especially if the prostate is stimulated, but she stressed that \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d are both subjective.\n\nI was curious as to who would be willing to speak on their experiences with pegging. I was interested in speaking with both black men and women who had engaged in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot shockingly, I found that more women were willing to discuss it than men. In fact, only two black men were willing to talk about it with me, and both did so under the condition that they remain anonymous because of the stigma attached to the activity.\n\nTelling, right?\n\nAddressing the stigma.\n\nComic and writer Ashley Ray told me she was not surprised that more women were willing to talk about it than men. She acknowledged that there is more of a stigma attached to it among black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear fears of being \u2018on the down low\u2019 with white men, but I think black men fear that reputation if they try pegging,\u201d Ray said.\n\nHer experiences with pegging have mostly been with men who are not black. The one black partner who did indulge her in butt play insisted that she only use her fingers and never toys.\n\n\u201cIt was his request,\u201d Ray said. \u201cHe liked getting his ass ate and asked me to try a finger, but it started from a very \u2018while you\u2019re going down on me\u2019 or \u2018while you\u2019re eating my ass\u2019 place. I think him just bending over for me felt too weird for him at first.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEventually he was cool with that,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut it still could only be my hand or fisting, since that\u2019s not \u2018dick-shaped,\u2019 in his words.\u201d\n\nAre men really into it?\n\nRay said that more men are into it than will openly admit to it.\n\n\u201cWe live in this culture full of toxic masculinity, and that really limits the pleasures men are \u2018allowed\u2019 to feel without being shamed for it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to say stuff like it makes you gay or feminine, but that\u2019s just ignorant of the fact that it just feels good for anyone with a prostate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, both men who opened up to me about it said that they are very into it and it is very pleasurable for them. Both identify as straight.\n\nThe first, a 35-year-old black man, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s something I enjoy but rarely get to experience. It\u2019s still considered as \u2018gay,\u2019 and we\u2019re still homophobic as a staff, label and crew.\u201d\n\nThe second, a 41-year-old black man, agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve tried it and love it. I don\u2019t get a chance to do it often,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad. I wish it wasn\u2019t that way. We just want to have fun ... it\u2019s just, we don\u2019t put a cap on the type of fun we\u2019re into. The woman I\u2019m dating now is OK with it, though we haven\u2019t done it with the strap-on yet. Hopefully soon. We had the conversation Tuesday and she wasn\u2019t bothered. She\u2019s also bi,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat about the women who are into it?\n\nTracy Renee Jones is a 45-year-old queer woman who identifies as biracial. She told me that while she likes pegging, she is not interested in doing it with a man who is not comfortable with himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less interested in a man that is scared or unwilling to express his needs and wants than I am with having a hard limit placed on anal play. I\u2019m more averse to it because of my own expectations and needs, but I support a couple pegging if both parties are comfortable and enjoy it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nKyoko, a 26-year-old black bisexual woman, agrees. She said that as a part-time sex worker, she has often had clients request it, but there is a stigma attached to it that she believes is partially the fault of cishet women as well.\n\n\u201cCishet women are complicit in the shaming, according to my clients,\u201d she said. \u201c[Male clients] tell me if they actually work up the nerve to ask or test the waters about anal play, they often get, \u2018Uh, no, I\u2019m not going to do that to you. Why would you want me to anyway?

It was an article that organizers in the Movement for Black Lives say included multiple inaccuracies, and as the group seeks corrections or a retraction, it responded with an op-ed of its own to set the record straight.\n\nIn \u201cWhat Happened to Black Lives Matter?\u201d BuzzFeed reporter Darren Sands said that in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, while the nation had the biggest outpouring of liberal activism in more than a decade, Black Lives Matter seems less visible than it was a year ago, and the movement is struggling with disputes over direction and leadership.\n\nSands spoke with members of groups that are part of Black Lives Matter and spoke of the history of the movement, the origins of its ideals, the people who are said to have started it and those who are perceived to lead it. There are also hints of infighting, people disillusioned with the movement and where it is headed, and questions about how it will be sustained and continued.\n\nOrganizers within the Movement for Black Lives took issue with that portrayal and wrote their own op-ed on Mic addressing the things said in Sands\u2019 article.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous times for our people,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHistory tells us that we need responsible, thoughtful and brave journalism. But movements can be stopped in their tracks by uninformed and inaccurate hit pieces that trade in gossip. We must consider what we believe in, who we stand with, and what we are fighting for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s worth reading both pieces to consider the differing opinions surrounding the movement. Those who spoke on the record with Sands echoed some of his assertions, the same assertions that Movement for Black Lives seeks to clarify.\n\nOne point that Movement for Black Lives makes clear is that just as in previous movements, there is going to be conflict; not everyone is going to agree on every point or every approach, but it\u2019s the way that conflict is handled that will dictate how far the movement can go:\n\nWe are not always in full agreement, we have competing ideas and we will undoubtedly upset each other in the process of making difficult decisions. We are here because we believe that our victories in service of black people are bigger and better when we win together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then:\n\nAnd when we arrive at conflict, we do our best to hold each other to that standard, no matter how difficult or inconvenient. We don\u2019t always get this right, but in order to do so, it requires all of us to hold these values.\n\nRead more at Mic and BuzzFeed.", "keywords": ["lives", "seeks", "movement", "conflict", "happened", "wrote", "responds", "sands", "black", "matter", "spoke", "record"], "polarity": 0.07979407979407979, "subjectivity": 0.5034427284427284},

It became of interest in pop culture and media a few decades ago, in the 1990s, with educational pornographic films such as Bend Over Boyfriend,\u201d Laureano said. \u201cEven though this definition was made popular by a particular community, other communities and bodies have been engaging in ass play forever. Sometimes heterosexuals are not as advanced or pleasure-creative as they think they are. Where\u2019s THAT Queer Eye for the Straight Guy show!?\u201d\n\nLaureano said that pegging can be enjoyable for both people who participate, and intense and more powerful ejaculations have been reported by men who engage in it, especially if the prostate is stimulated, but she stressed that \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d are both subjective.\n\nI was curious as to who would be willing to speak on their experiences with pegging. I was interested in speaking with both black men and women who had engaged in it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot shockingly, I found that more women were willing to discuss it than men. In fact, only two black men were willing to talk about it with me, and both did so under the condition that they remain anonymous because of the stigma attached to the activity.\n\nTelling, right?\n\nAddressing the stigma.\n\nComic and writer Ashley Ray told me she was not surprised that more women were willing to talk about it than men. She acknowledged that there is more of a stigma attached to it among black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear fears of being \u2018on the down low\u2019 with white men, but I think black men fear that reputation if they try pegging,\u201d Ray said.\n\nHer experiences with pegging have mostly been with men who are not black. The one black partner who did indulge her in butt play insisted that she only use her fingers and never toys.\n\n\u201cIt was his request,\u201d Ray said. \u201cHe liked getting his ass ate and asked me to try a finger, but it started from a very \u2018while you\u2019re going down on me\u2019 or \u2018while you\u2019re eating my ass\u2019 place. I think him just bending over for me felt too weird for him at first.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEventually he was cool with that,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut it still could only be my hand or fisting, since that\u2019s not \u2018dick-shaped,\u2019 in his words.\u201d\n\nAre men really into it?\n\nRay said that more men are into it than will openly admit to it.\n\n\u201cWe live in this culture full of toxic masculinity, and that really limits the pleasures men are \u2018allowed\u2019 to feel without being shamed for it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to say stuff like it makes you gay or feminine, but that\u2019s just ignorant of the fact that it just feels good for anyone with a prostate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, both men who opened up to me about it said that they are very into it and it is very pleasurable for them. Both identify as straight.\n\nThe first, a 35-year-old black man, told me: \u201cIt\u2019s something I enjoy but rarely get to experience. It\u2019s still considered as \u2018gay,\u2019 and we\u2019re still homophobic as a staff, label and crew.\u201d\n\nThe second, a 41-year-old black man, agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve tried it and love it. I don\u2019t get a chance to do it often,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad. I wish it wasn\u2019t that way. We just want to have fun ... it\u2019s just, we don\u2019t put a cap on the type of fun we\u2019re into. The woman I\u2019m dating now is OK with it, though we haven\u2019t done it with the strap-on yet. Hopefully soon. We had the conversation Tuesday and she wasn\u2019t bothered. She\u2019s also bi,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat about the women who are into it?\n\nTracy Renee Jones is a 45-year-old queer woman who identifies as biracial. She told me that while she likes pegging, she is not interested in doing it with a man who is not comfortable with himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less interested in a man that is scared or unwilling to express his needs and wants than I am with having a hard limit placed on anal play. I\u2019m more averse to it because of my own expectations and needs, but I support a couple pegging if both parties are comfortable and enjoy it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nKyoko, a 26-year-old black bisexual woman, agrees. She said that as a part-time sex worker, she has often had clients request it, but there is a stigma attached to it that she believes is partially the fault of cishet women as well.\n\n\u201cCishet women are complicit in the shaming, according to my clients,\u201d she said. \u201c[Male clients] tell me if they actually work up the nerve to ask or test the waters about anal play, they often get, \u2018Uh, no, I\u2019m not going to do that to you. Why would you want me to anyway?

Men and women should have the same agency in sexual exchanges, and if, after straightforward and honest communication, terms cannot be negotiated, then on to the next.\u201d\n\nRay said that we have to be open and bold about it, but she admits that even as she says that, there are still plenty of difficulties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because there aren\u2019t a lot of spaces where people can talk openly or freely about their sexuality or kinks, but I don\u2019t hide my harnesses, butt plugs or strap-ons from my partners,\u201d Ray said. \u201cI try to make anyone who enters my space feel comfortable and safe trying something they might not have thought of before.\u201d\n\nSexpert Michelle Hope said, \u201cI think that we must continue to educate people about the deeper meaning of sexuality and how it\u2019s a part of the whole human experience, not just what happens during the physical act of sex.\u201d\n\nAnd for those who do decide to engage, a little advice.\n\nFor those who do decide to dip their toe in the pool, Laureano had this advice for beginners:\n\nDiscuss comfort, lube and desired outcome.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now.

There are people incarcerated for no other reason than they can\u2019t afford to purchase their freedom.

Every day, nearly 700,000 people are incarcerated despite often not being charged with a crime, simply because they cannot afford to make bail. In addition, there are more black men in prison now than were enslaved in 1850, and many of the black men serving pretrial detention have been accused of minor drug and \u201cpublic order\u201d offenses that disproportionately target black people.\n\n\u201cGetting fathers out of jail for Father\u2019s Day is the emancipation proclamation of freedom,\u201d Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, executive director at the Ordinary People\u2019s Society, said. \u201cWhat we are doing is putting our money where our mouth is.

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them? Isn\u2019t that the kind of hard-hitting question a good reporter would want answers to?\n\n\n\nHow about, Why wasn\u2019t the family given any details about Anthony\u2019s death, yet a press conference was held where they went so far as to play the 911 call for the public? That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why. Some of you didn\u2019t even attempt to describe why. At this point, if you need an explanation as to why that happened, you shouldn\u2019t be a reporter.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for us to believe that you don\u2019t know the crisis of police violence in black and brown communities. That deputies consistently get away with killing unarmed black children. That when the brother of the deceased asks, \u201cBased on the information that you\u2019ve collected, do you think we\u2019re due something?\u201d and LASD Capt. Christopher Bergner replies, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d that that is NOT OK\u2014and it\u2019s also not because he was misheard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only explanation left is that you accept that your job is just a mechanism to uphold white supremacist systems and condone the killing of black children. If you disagree, then do your job\u2014report the truth.\n\nAnd the truth is black grief in its entirety.\n\nHere are a few quick tips to help you get started on your path of true reporting:\n\nInstead of \u201cgang member,\u201d use \u201cchild.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cangry mob,\u201d use \u201cgrieving community.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cchaos,\u201d use \u201ccompletely rational response to the murder of a 16-year-old.\u201d\n\n\n\nInstead of \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Department said \u2026 ,\u201d use \u201cthe family and community said \u2026 \u201d\n\nInstead of catering to racists and opportunists, cater to justice and peace for the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some examples of what not to do:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there are further questions\u2014and there should be\u2014reach out directly to the affected family, community or local organizations doing the work.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s that easy. Somehow, POC media is capable of doing that in every story. Perhaps your careless reporting is due to the fact that there is no diversity in your newsroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with the words of Amber Marie, whose 17-year-old nephew Armando Garcia was shot to death by deputies earlier this summer.\n\nThe same LASD rep, Capt. Christopher Bergner, claimed that the deputies were trying to shoot a dog and that the bullets ricocheted off the ground.

Our fairer-skinned, \u201cMAGA\u201d compatriots who order dry whole wheat toast?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is d\u2014all of the above.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a vast, paranoid conspiracy theory, I point you in the direction of the Boston Police Department.\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union reveal that for years, the Boston Police Department has been using a sophisticated social media monitoring program to spy on the social media posts of Black Lives Matter activists, Muslims and even high school students in the area, according to Privacy SOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., major cities across the country began creating special intelligence units dedicated to preventing acts of terrorism. These interdepartmental units are basically local versions of the FBI, employing the same kinds of surveillance techniques. They are ostensibly local spy agencies.\n\n\n\nThe New York City Police Department\u2019s intelligence unit monitored text messages from Black Lives Matter members. Baltimore\u2019s version used high-definition cameras attached to planes flying above the city 24 hours a day to monitor activists after the uprising over Freddie Gray\u2019s death in police custody. But maybe none were as sophisticated as the Boston Regional Intelligence Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe BPD used a program called Geofeedia that monitored Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms used by any activists with more than a pinch of melanin in their skin. It collected information about political beliefs, social activism, religious activities and regular conversations that had no importance related to criminal activity. It tagged anyone who spoke out against law enforcement.\n\nWhat it did not do is solve a single crime.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make this clear: Geofeedia and the Boston Police Department were not targeting criminal suspects. They were not trying to solve or prevent crimes. The people they surveilled were not even suspected of any past or future wrongdoing. They were just regular black people. They were just ordinary Muslim citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a man named Tito Jackson, for instance. In November 2014, Jackson wrote a Facebook post about being thankful. He talked about helping the citizens of his community pass out turkeys in the days prior to Thanksgiving. He told people to be thankful that they weren\u2019t homeless. But Jackson made a grave mistake in his Facebook post. He mentioned the words \u201cFerguson\u201d and \u201cpolice brutality.\u201d He was now under surveillance.\n\nJackson is not a criminal. Most people wouldn\u2019t even consider him radical. But he was black, which made him a target of the Boston police. There is one more thing that is important to know about Jackson and his targeting:\n\nHe was also a Boston city councilman.\n\nIn March 2016, over 1,000 students walked out of Boston public schools to protest budget cuts. Forty-two percent of students in the Boston Public Schools district are Latinx and 35 percent are black. Only 14 percent are white. Of course, Geofeedia was watching them. The software cataloged the students\u2019 social media communication. As intricately detailed as the program seemed to be, it did not differentiate between harmless private conversation and serious threats. Maybe because \u201cthey\u201d didn\u2019t care. Or perhaps stopping violence was never the purpose of the software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program also tracked Muslims who used everyday terms in regular communications. Two of the most frequent \u201ctrigger words\u201d that popped up alerts in the system were \u201cummah\u201d\u2014 which roughly translates to \u201ccommunity\u201d in Arabic\u2014and \u201cMuslim Lives Matter\u201d because ... of course. The Islamophobic algorithm resulted in almost every religious service and charitable activity in Boston\u2019s Muslim community being spied on, including events like a Muslims Against Hunger fundraiser.\n\nSupposedly a crime-fighting tool, Geofeedia was used by the BRIC as a virtual, online version of stop and frisk. There is no evidence that the data resulted in a single arrest. (Although, to be fair, a number of teenagers were arrested for recklessly driving their bicycles. Some people suspect it was because the hashtag #BikeLife was a trigger word in the software.) Instead, the software targeted individuals based mainly on their political beliefs and religion.\n\nThe BPD no longer uses Geofeedia\u2014not because it was ineffective or because there is no evidence that it ever helped prevent a single incident of violence, but because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram banned its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an isolated occurrence in a single municipality. It is part of the invisible cost of being black or Muslim and speaking above a whisper. Even if you have no nefarious intentions, you will be watched if you are a person of color who uses his or her voice to do ... well ... anything. It is not even about crime prevention, protecting or serving. It is about control. It is about forcing brown mouths to shut the fuck up.\n\nWhether it is giving away food, fighting for education reform or even thanking God, not being white is cause for suspicion in and of itself. The first right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights is freedom of speech, religion and assembly because, without it, none of the others are possible. If the people entrusted with enforcing those laws are the ones who violate them, then who in this country is really free?\n\nAdvertisement\n\na. White people.\n\nb. Wypipo.\n\nc.

On this day in 1886, men and women, many of them recent immigrants, organized a nationwide workers strike that led to the creation of the eight-hour workday and other basic protections for workers.\n\n\n\nThis May Day, that struggle continues as the Movement for Black Lives, wage activists and those who believe in freedom (\u201cthe Majority\u201d) join forces in support of racial, gender, immigrant, disability, queer, economic and environmental justice. This resistance goes Beyond the Moment, beyond moments of outrage, beyond narrow concepts of sanctuary and beyond barriers between communities that have much at stake and so much in common. We will strike, rally and resist. We will amplify the voices of the unheard, recognize the labor of those who are silenced and marginalized, and lift up those people in this country for whom protection has never been guaranteed.\n\nMalcolm X once said that \u201cthe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\u201d These words, unfortunately, are still true today decades after his death. Today and every day, we center and celebrate women and femmes of the past as we stand up for the future of our communities.\n\nThe contributions and labor of black women are erased in our stories of social change, in media, in our homes and workplaces, and in our movements. We cannot value what we cannot see. The erasure of black women\u2019s work\u2014by men and white women\u2014and the rendering of that work as invisible contribute to its ongoing devaluation.\n\n\n\nDomestic work is an example of how black women\u2019s work has been devalued. Domestic work is rooted in the legacy of slavery, and today, this industry is largely made up of women of color and immigrant women. Domestic work is paid and unpaid labor that occurs inside the home, and it is the work that makes all other work possible. And yet domestic work, because it is done by black women, women of color and immigrant women, is not valued as work. It is seen as simply \u201cwhat women are supposed to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that women make 77 cents to every dollar that men make, and yet few address the racial disparities in the wage gaps between women and men (pdf), as well as between women of color and white women, and between transgender and cisgender women.\n\nHistorically, Martin Luther King Jr. is often credited with leading the civil rights movement, when we know that black women like Rosa Parks, Diane Nash, Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker were its backbone. This legacy, unfortunately, continues today as the work and contributions of the women of color who organized the Women\u2019s March on Washington were dismissed in favor of narratives that credited only white women for the largest mobilization in this nation\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate May Day, we also observe that this day is no exception.\n\nDuring the 1886 Haymarket Uprising, a clash between thousands of workers striking for an eight-hour workday and Chicago police, Lucy Gonzales Parsons, a black, Mexican and indigenous woman, was allegedly described by a Chicago official as \u201cmore dangerous than a thousand rioters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Gonzales Parsons, firmly positioned at the center of the uprising, was one of the most dedicated and radical labor organizers this country has ever seen. She organized that famous Haymarket strike and should be considered an integral part of what we observe today as International Workers\u2019 Day\u2014but we rarely hear her name spoken in relation to the history of the labor movement in the United States. Her labor\u2014alongside the labor of millions of black women, women of color and immigrant women\u2014remains unseen and uncelebrated.\n\nUnseen and unpaid labor built and maintains the American economy\u2014an economy not only rooted in but also reliant on militaristic, anti-black, anti-worker and anti-women principles. The American economy functions because it pools the wealth of the people in the hands of the few, strategically disenfranchises black communities, and perpetuates the falsehood of a separate and inferior sphere of women\u2019s work. Its function is enforced and maintained by a hypermilitarized police force whose primary directive is to keep those in power and those with wealth safe. But, as Lucy Gonzales Parsons declared in 1890, \u201cWhen the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe are no longer the protesting minority: we are the Majority. But we will achieve no progress on any of the issues we care about and organize around if our speech is repressed by law enforcement, our bodies are imprisoned behind bars and our voices are silenced while our work is erased. We will achieve no progress if the people who power our economy, who care for our children and elderly loved ones, continue to be erased.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen firsthand that the people who believe in freedom, justice and humanity greatly outnumber those whose values are rooted in white supremacy, division and hatred. Each time we come together, we build a movement that is strong and diverse enough to protect one another.\n\nThis May Day, we are uniquely positioned to uplift and unify the voices of black and brown people, immigrant communities, the economically unstable, women, children, the disabled, the LGBTQ community, those working to protect our right to work, and those fighting for our right to clean air and water. Our collaboration is rooted in the shared principle that none of us will survive without all of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt will last #BeyondTheMoment.\n\n\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nAlicia Garza is a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter network, and the special-projects director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance.

But McKesson\u2019s lawyer asked that the case be thrown out.\n\nFrom The Advocate:\n\nBilly Gibbens, who represents DeRay Mckesson, of Baltimore, argued the suit against Mckesson should be thrown out because it makes only unsupported, speculative allegations.

North Carolina. Florida. My God. This is really happening.\u201d\n\nAs last night\u2019s results rolled in, I was hunkered down in a war room with colleagues. Together we watched our greatest fear, and that of millions of others around the country, be actualized in real time.\n\nMy body stiffened as state by state, vote by vote, our nation transitioned into the hands of a man who galvanized millions by activating the hateful, racist, misogynistic, sexist and xenophobic feelings residing in the hearts of so many Americans. Upon realizing it was over, I sat almost paralyzed in my chair, and surprisingly, the first thing that popped into my mind was, \u201cWe have to get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nNow, to those who understand the gravity and tremendous danger that comes with a Donald Trump presidency and a Republican-dominated House and Senate, that sentiment would make perfect sense, especially for black and brown people. But in that moment of legitimately contemplating whether I could get my family and loved ones out of the country, I entered into immediate internal conflict with myself.\n\nShortly after that, I posted a comment on social media about getting a passport with the hashtag #WeOutOrNah? While it was admittedly clever, I wrestled with it later. In that moment, I was serious about leaving because how could I stay in a place that would elect someone like Donald Trump? But on the other hand, how could I consider leaving when I\u2019ve dedicated my life to fighting for black and brown people and those living at the margins in this country? \u201cWhat the hell kind of movement-minded, community-focused person would leave their people behind to suffer?\u201d I asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking a step back, I realized that this was one of those pivotal, existential moments that come with walking in my full, unapologetic blackness. I was forcing myself to acknowledge and reckon with the complexity of my identity, and within that I came face-to-face with fears I\u2019ve refused to deal with. Not because anyone invalidated them, but because I had convinced myself that there was no room for them if I was going to really support my people, some of whom are suffering from institutional oppression in ways I can\u2019t begin to relate to personally.\n\nBut it was those repressed, suppressed fears that led to thoughts of leaving the U.S. The reality of living in a nation run by someone as deplorable and unfit as our president-elect ignited all kinds of thoughts and ideas that connected to and conflicted with my blackness and role in my community.\n\nThe black woman in me who wants to raise children in a safe environment within the next few years chirped up and said, \u201cNo way that\u2019s happening with Trump in office. Roll out.\u201d But my passion for and commitment to creating safe environments for all black and brown children, not just my own, reside with that identity, too. I\u2019ve committed to fighting in the battle to end state-sanctioned criminalization of young people of color, and to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. But I\u2019m afraid to stay and have kids who would live in communities filled with stop-and-frisk- and law-and-order-happy police officers who would have even less incentive to see our children as anything other than criminals and threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes being terrified of these and other things really put me at odds with who I\u2019ve committed myself to being and, more importantly, who my community needs me to be? Can I be \u201csuper woke,\u201d someone who believes that liberation must be achieved by any means necessary, and still in this moment have thoughts about a Trump-free life in Ghana?\n\nI can. And anyone else who finds him- or herself conflicted in the aftermath of the election can, too. That\u2019s the beautiful and complicated thing about black consciousness and identity. Our experiences as people of African descent in this country are so laden with struggles, triumphs, fears, hopes, nightmares and dreams deferred that there\u2019s room for any and all feelings about our existence. They may not all be right or ideal for your circumstance, and they may not be in alignment with commitments you\u2019ve made, but they\u2019re OK, and they\u2019re yours to process how you see fit.\n\nFor me and others conspiring in this fight for racial justice and equality, leaving at this moment is not the right thing to do. In essence, this is what we\u2019ve been working for; this is the moment our ancestors have prepared us for. But for others, leaving now to explore other opportunities or experiences outside the U.S. might be what\u2019s best for their well-being and that of their family. And that\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I firmly believe that the organizing and building we\u2019ve been doing the past few years, connected with the legacy of our ancestors, will come together now as never before. The love and the shared passion and vision we\u2019ve seen manifest is transformative, and I\u2019m supposed to stick around and help where I\u2019m needed. So in the end, I answered my own question: Nah, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\n\nChelsea Fuller is a strategic communicator working in Washington, D.C.

Masterfully produced and directed by DuVernay, it is a poignant documentary detailing white America\u2019s continual, desperate and ever-changing attempts to maintain racial and legal domination over black people.\n\nWhat has emerged as common knowledge through the Movement for Black Lives is laid out clearly and plainly in the film: Mass incarceration and modern-day policing are mutations of American slavery that mean to maintain the economic, social, political and legal subjugation of black people to support the (white) American enterprise.\n\nHailed as one of the most important films of the year, 13th evokes the eponymous 13th Amendment, which simultaneously emancipated enslaved Africans and laid the groundwork for their continued confinement and the forced extraction of labor from their bodies through convict leasing, Jim Crow and, more recently, \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing and the war on drugs. The abolition of slavery, \u201cexcept as a punishment for crime,\u201d is an insidious loophole in the 13th Amendment that provides an instructive framework from which audiences can better understand today\u2019s crisis of mass incarceration: The U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and a quarter of the world\u2019s prisoners.\n\n13th boasts an impressive slate of organizers, historians, advocates, scholars and formerly incarcerated people who tell the origin story and contemporary impact of America\u2019s hypercriminalization of black people, including the power of media to create narratives about blackness that were so terrifying that even black America took up the mantle to cage and confine our kindred in the name of \u201claw and order.\u201d\n\nHowever, the film\u2019s power is tempered by a glaring omission: black women\u2019s stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring neither slavery nor Jim Crow nor the deceptively named war on drugs have black women been immune from the hypercriminality imposed on black people. In 2000, black women and men were incarcerated at 6 and 7.5 times (pdf) the rates of white women and men, respectively.\n\nA pivotal moment in the timeline presented by 13th is Ronald Reagan\u2019s ascendance to the presidency in 1981, when he launched his war on drugs, which was manufactured to decimate black communities and later became the foundation for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 doubly horrible crime bill.\n\nBut by centering the story of the criminalization squarely on black men, 13th invisibilizes the unique conditions that compound and give way to both cis and transgender black women\u2019s experiences in America at the intersections of racial and gender policing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, black women are the fastest-growing prison population, and this phenomenon can directly be tied into the disgraceful war on drugs that effectively criminalized people suspected of trafficking and using drugs as well as their partners, children and parents. Lest we not forget, Alberta Spruill, 57, was killed after New York City police officers broke down her door and threw a concussion grenade into her home while searching for guns and drugs that were not there.\n\n13th briefly mentions Sharanda Jones, a black woman serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a first-time drug offense, but her story is more common than is alluded to in the film. Black women are often swept into the carceral system either from being targeted by the war on drugs themselves or for little more than their relationship to partners who are being targeted by the state.\n\nSimilarly, when conversations about bail reform and the heartbreaking story of Kalief Browder\u2014a young black man who killed himself after being held for three years at New York City's Rikers Island jail for his inability to make bail\u2014emerged in the film, important insights into how black women are affected by the lack of access to fair bail hearings failed to be brought to light. Imagine being held in incarceration while waiting for trial because you can\u2019t make bail and being pregnant. Currently, 28 states still enforce \u201cshackling laws\u201d that require pregnant women to be \u201cshackled\u201d by the hands, feet, stomach or all three during childbirth\u2014a practice that has led to stillborn births, birth defects and maternal mortality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 13th remembers Reagan as the chief architect of the war on drugs, many black feminists also remember him as the creator and exploiter of the \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d a mythical black woman who defrauded the government for millions through public assistance. The welfare queen, and the conservative lore that surrounded her, gave way to a massive destabilization of welfare and the criminalization of those on public assistance.\n\nYes, black men are heavily criminalized and brutalized by police aggression, but so are black women.\n\nWe cannot talk about Trayvon Martin and not mention Renisha McBride. We cannot discuss Michael Brown and not say the name of Sandra Bland. Kayla Moore and Alfred Olango are equally important to understanding how black people are affected by state violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is critical that histories of white supremacy in America recognize that as long as there have been black women in America, the anti-blackness of the state has fashioned itself to eviscerate black women just as intentionally as it has black men.\n\nWe are more than a brief aside to black men\u2019s stories. We are, and have always been, under attack from the American carceral state. It\u2019s time to tell our stories, too. #SayOurNames.\n\nSamantha Master is a black-queer-feminist activist, educator and member of the Black Youth Project 100.

Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund was conceptualized \u201cto promote the education of deserving undergraduate students who enroll full time at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\u201d\n\nAs The Root previously reported, 15-year-old Jordan, two of his brothers and their friends were leaving a house party on April 29, 2017, when Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver pointed his rifle at the car full of teens and opened fire, fatally shooting Jordan in the head.\n\nOliver was eventually fired and indicted on murder charges, but not before Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber attempted to justify Jordan\u2019s extrajudicial killing. Haber initially claimed that the car in which Jordan was traveling was \u201cbacking down the street toward officers in an aggressive manner,\u201d which prompted Oliver to open fire.\n\nHaber later admitted during a press conference that he lied \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cAfter reviewing the video, I don\u2019t believe that [the fatal shooting] met our core values,\u201d Haber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan, a freshman honor student and athlete at Mesquite High School, dreamed of attending the University of Alabama and playing football for the Crimson Tide. Oliver ended those dreams with a single bullet, but Jordan\u2019s legacy will not die.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,\u201d the scholarship\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan. ... It will be the duty of the scholarship recipients to carry on a legacy of hope in Jordan\u2019s name, hope for a better, diverse tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen Brandon P. Bell, who plays the character Troy in Dear White People, heard Jordan\u2019s story, he connected with the teen on a visceral level and knew that he had to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was motivated by frustration. I\u2019m from Dallas, so I have that connection, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Bell said in an interview with The Root.\n\n\u201cI read about Jordan\u2019s story and was on the verge of tears. I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do it specifically for the family,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo I reached out to them to see how they wanted to honor Jordan\u2019s legacy, and they wanted to do that through education. Everything started from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarque Richardson, who plays Reggie on Dear White People, has been with Bell every step of the way in seeing this scholarship fund come to fruition. He also traveled with Bell to Texas to meet Jordan\u2019s family.\n\n\n\n\u201cUA was Jordan\u2019s dream school, but his life\u2014and the opportunity to realize his dreams\u2014was stolen from him and his family,\u201d Richardson told The Root.\n\nBoth Bell and Richardson said that the scholarship fund was created to give students the opportunity to live out their dreams because Jordan no longer can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the scholarship specifies that funds will be awarded to \u201cdeserving students,\u201d Bell made it clear that \u201cdeserving\u201d is about much more than grades and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concept of being deserving is so vast,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about how someone looks on paper, not just their GPA. But do they represent who Jordan was as a person? Do they understand\u2014or are they trying to learn\u2014about the systemic oppression that creates the environment where Jordan\u2019s death can take place?\n\n\u201cThe family created an essay question for the scholarship, and it really reflects the heart of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichardson agreed, adding that supporting students and helping them navigate a racist society is critical.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help pave the way so that our leaders of tomorrow have the tools they need to create the change we need,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to take it to the streets, but we also have to have people in positions to influence policy and legislation, to change the world on an institutional level. That\u2019s what this scholarship is about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to create space for our children to be supported in the fullness of their humanity,\u201d Richardson continued. \u201cWe have to do what we can do to help them reach their goals. They deserve that. This scholarship fund is an entity that will last forever, and it\u2019s one more tool that, at its core, can be used to keep our people alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The Root, civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt, who represents the Edwards family, said, \u201cThe murder of Jordan Edwards represented not only a tragic loss to his family, but his death robbed our community of a valuable resource of potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis scholarship fund is an ingenious mechanism for beginning to make up for that great loss, but it can\u2019t end here,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cWe are pushing to get police reform legislation passed in Jordan\u2019s name, a football stadium dedicated to his memory and above all a historical conviction in the Texas Criminal Courts for his murderer, Roy Oliver.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs college costs continue to rise, Bell said that it was also important to him to lift the economic burden from students\u2019 shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without the support of the community, cast, and Jordan\u2019s love of life guiding the way,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI have learned that we must rely on each other for support.\u201d\n\nClick here to donate to the Jordan J.

The statement closes with a solemn commitment and enduring promise to fight anti-blackness everywhere: 'We see you. We hear you. We stand with you.'\"\n\nRead the full #Arabs4BlackPower statement below:\n\n\n\nWe, the undersigned artists, academics, mothers, fathers, students, refugees, and community organizers with ties to Arabic\u00ad-speaking regions, declare our unwavering solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). We fully and wholeheartedly endorse the policy demands put forth by the US\u00ad-based Movement for Black Lives platform and its transnationalist vision for Black power, freedom and justice. We join you in reiterating the necessity of shared struggle and collective liberation of all oppressed and indigenous people globally. For liberation to be real and genuine, we all need to get free. The current iteration of the movement to end the war and genocide against Black people in the US is rooted in centuries of the Black freedom struggle. As we commemorate the month of Black August and its history of radical resistance, we as #Arabs4BlackPower commit to amplifying the rebellions of Black and indigenous people in the settler\u00ad-colonies of the Americas; and to joining in the fight against white supremacy, patriarchy, and hyper\u00ad-militarized late capitalism. Once again, Black people in the US are defending themselves from the violence inscribed in the Americas' settler colonialist regimes built on the backs of Indigenous, Black, and Brown people through the expropriation of indigenous lands, genocide, and slavery. Once again, Black freedom fighters are refusing colonial and imperial narratives that uphold white supremacy and are continuing to craft a language rooted in the struggle for justice. Once again, Black liberation movements are challenging systems of criminalization that dehumanize, incarcerate, and assassinate Indigenous, Black, and Brown people\u2014systems that simultaneously transcend and reinforce national boundaries through border-control complexes to terrorize people around the world under the umbrella of the global \u201cwar on terror.\u201d And once again, Black organizers in the US have put forth a vision to continue imagining and transforming these systems within and across borders. The U.S. empire violently exerts control over Indigenous, Black, and Brown communities internally and around the globe. People in predominantly Arabic\u00ad-speaking regions experience empire in locally specific material forms: bombings, drone strikes, forced disappearances, checkpoints, carceral wars, forced migration, indigenous displacement, starvation, the theft of natural resources, apartheid, and more. The geography of \u2018Ferguson to Palestine\u2019 is integral to #Arabs4BlackPower charting the structural connections, albeit different manifestations, inscribed by the US-\u00adled \u201cwar on terror.\u201d It connects anti\u00ad-Blackness as well as anti\u00ad-Muslim and anti\u00adArab racism in the US with global imperial wars in the rest of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cwar on terror\u201d rests on regional geopolitical alliances forged for the sole purpose of maintaining and furthering imperial and Zionist hegemony. It is situated within a genealogy of colonial legacies that have structured power in Arabic\u00adspeaking regions along the lines of gender, religion, ethnicity, skin color, language, and sexual orientation, to name a few. With these genealogies in mind, those of us struggling to rid all communities of the Maghreb and the Mashreq* from militarization and neoliberalism must center the lived experiences and aspirations of women, Black Arabs, Nubians, Imazighen, Kurds, Armenians, migrant workers, refugees, gender\u00ad-nonconforming individuals, queers, and others. We pledge to work against marginalization within our communities in all its forms and to continue examining the language we use as we continue dismantling colonial legacies. We must refuse and erase national boundaries created to divide us\u00ad\u00ad\u2014building with the oppressed from Palestine to Western Sahara, from Yemen to Syria, from Algeria to Sudan, from Tunisia to Egypt and beyond, as we come together in solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives. In pledging to resist and overcome, we as #Arabs4BlackPower unequivocally support the M4BL platform for reparations, invest\u00ad-divest, economic justice, community control and political power. We recognize, as did many before us, that only through joint struggle will we dismantle the distinct yet intersecting systems that both oppress Black and Indigenous people in the settler colonies of the Americas and institutionalize a war of terror from within US boundaries to the Mashreq, Maghreb, and beyond. To this end, we commit ourselves to combating anti\u00ad-Blackness wherever we find it in our communities\u2014both within the boundaries of the US as immigrant\u00ad-settlers complicit in white supremacy, as well as in Arabic\u00adspeaking regions where socio\u00ad-historically distinct forms of discrimination against Black Arabs intersect with other forms of marginalization along the lines of gender, religion, ethnicity, skin color, language, and sexual orientation to name a few. From Ferguson to Palestine: we will work for liberation. To everyone building towards the Movement for Black Lives: We see you. We hear you.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["hiring", "industry", "simply", "designer", "missing", "black", "action", "talent", "problem", "fashion", "chasemarshall", "designers"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

Issues around mass incarceration, health care and police funding were featured by the advocates. They also focused on the importance of voter registration and education. The groups emphasized that public policy is one part of a broader strategy they will be focused on.\n\nBYP100 National Director Charlene Carruthers and National Public Policy Chair Janae Bonsu led the group of about 30 young activists on Capitol Hill. They were also joined by members of the National Black Justice Coalition.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Over the past year, this movement has been working to translate our lived experience and collective needs into concrete policy proposals,\" Bonsu said of BYP100's advocacy efforts.

Danny Davis (D-Ill.), and Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). They also met with Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) for over an hour in a session broadcast on Facebook Live, as well as with Sen.

But the picture many saw told only one side of the story.\n\nPolice killed the woman, Korryn Gaines, and her 5-year-old son was wounded in the altercation. She had attempted to share her encounter with police using Instagram. The police urged Facebook, which owns Instagram, to deactivate her accounts. In response, Facebook cut Gaines\u2019 live stream from its feed.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. In July, Diamond Reynolds used Facebook Live to record the immediate aftermath of the horrific police shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile. Once footage hit 1 million views, Facebook temporarily removed the video. A Facebook spokesperson claimed this was due to a \u201ctechnical glitch,\u201d but many media reports suggest otherwise.\n\nFor many, Facebook has come to represent a public square\u2014a place where we can assemble with others, share information and speak our minds. But it isn\u2019t public. It\u2019s a private platform where everyone\u2019s rights to connect and communicate are subject to Facebook\u2019s often arbitrary terms and conditions.\n\nThe Constitution protects everyone\u2019s right to record police officers in the public discharge of their duties. But this right goes only as far as your smartphone. Once people decide to share the resulting videos\u2014including those that expose shocking police abuses\u2014the potential for state and private forces to censor the footage becomes very real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook claims to take down or block videos that glorify violence and says that it will grant law-enforcement requests to suspend accounts in cases where there is an \u201cimmediate risk of harm,\u201d but that\u2019s a vague and difficult standard to apply, and one that\u2019s subject to police discretion.\n\nThe Gaines and Reynolds videos remind us that social media companies like Facebook, Google (which owns YouTube) and Twitter ultimately control our ability to share the images that have fueled the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nThe fact that these companies can arbitrarily remove our speech, images and videos has serious consequences for those struggling to expose racial injustice to a wider audience. Earlier this week, more than 40 social justice and digital-rights groups sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter (pdf) urging the company to clarify its policy on honoring police requests to censor videos and other content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe groups, which include the Center for Media Justice, ColorOfChange.org, Daily Kos, Free Press and SumOfUs, also asked Facebook to restore Gaines\u2019 videos from her encounter with police so the public can decide whether the police violated her rights.\n\nIn the second half of 2015, Facebook received 855 requests from government and local authorities, including local police forces, for \u201cemergency\u201d action related to users\u2019 accounts. According to Facebook, these actions included the blocking of user access to accounts as well as the handover of user information. Over that time period, the company complied with nearly 3 out of every 4 such requests.\n\nThis raises several questions: Will police demand that Facebook cover up potential abuses that witnesses have recorded and then shared on the platform, even when there is no real risk of immediate harm? And how will it respond when the risk of harm comes from police violence itself? Shouldn\u2019t our right to record such interactions with law enforcement include our right to share these recordings with others?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook needs clear guidelines and processes that are transparent to users on how it determines whether to block someone\u2019s stream or deactivate an account. It shouldn\u2019t allow police to demand takedown requests to avoid scrutiny or cover up abuse. We need to know when and why Facebook and other social media platforms have granted these requests, with clear standards for the future.\n\n\u201cRisk of harm\u201d is a factor, but one could interpret that standard to justify censoring almost any interaction with law enforcement\u2014and especially those in which an interaction escalates because of a person\u2019s race.\n\nThe fight for racial equity in the media is often a fight against media monopoly, especially when these companies are white-owned and operated. And Facebook is a face of monopoly in the age of social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew gatekeepers like Facebook must make confronting racism a priority. Yes, Zuckerberg has been outspoken in his support for racial justice\u2014even hanging a Black Lives Matter sign outside company headquarters. But we must urge him to ensure that his company\u2019s actions match his words. Providing clarity and accountability on Facebook\u2019s policy for suspending accounts and blocking images of police encounters is a start.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nTimothy Karr is the senior director of strategy for Free Press, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for universal access to an open and affordable internet.

While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["students", "shooting", "gun", "aide", "stoneman", "far", "state", "school", "douglas", "parkland", "seeking", "right", "survivors", "used", "theories", "fla", "reform"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News.

One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun.

Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["celebrate", "nra", "gun", "rick", "yes", "gov", "scott", "school", "mental", "health", "law", "enforcement", "proposed", "weapons", "florida", "trump", "shouldnt", "ranks"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

I am at once in awe of and humbled by this youth resistance movement and its solidarity efforts, and yet almost indescribably devastated. This feeling of devastation goes beyond the tragic and preventable loss of life; it is connected to the loss of humanity that happens when we as a society choose to support some of our children while ignoring or even maligning others.\n\nWhy was it so easy to support the Parkland youths while the youths in the Movement for Black Lives were repudiated and disregarded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that the defense for enthusiastically supporting the young people in Parkland while remaining immovable on Black Lives Matter (the media\u2019s catchall term for all black organizers, regardless of actual affiliation) is that the latter supposedly had no actionable goals and no leadership.\n\nAnd yet the documented wins made possible through BLM\u2019s dedicated leadership, as well as the fearful hostility in the state\u2019s response, tell a different tale.\n\nFor the past four years, I have been part of a movement that has matured into the Movement for Black Lives, a collaboration of organizations that include groups like Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100 and the Dream Defenders. For years, these groups, largely led by young people, have been fighting for a better world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work has influenced changes to policies and legislation that endangered American lives. We have demonstrated against police brutality, created a policy platform that covers everything from tax reform to education, fought for the dignity of black people by pushing back against mainstream-media narratives, and engaged in electoral-justice projects that have led to more black people, and especially black women, running for office.\n\nSo much of this work began with the Dream Defenders, also started by students in Florida fighting gun violence. Dream Defenders fought the \u201cStand your ground\u201d self-defense law all the way to the state Capitol after it was used to defend the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. This fight is not a new one, but the Parkland students offer it a new face, one that was invited into the building instead of being forced to stage a 30-plus-day sit-in, as the Defenders did.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this isn\u2019t actually about whether or not the baseless assumptions of \u201cno goals or leadership\u201d were true\u2014clearly, they were not. It is about why so many people needed to believe it to be true in order to justify not supporting black youths.\n\nWe are not facing the real issue of what this country has done in constructing assumptions about race so deeply held as to be scarcely acknowledged. We believe that the youths from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, largely white and white-presenting, are innocent and therefore worthy of our sympathy and protection, whereas black youths and other black people are never considered truly innocent. There is always this societal narrative when it comes to the killing or persecution of black people that we somehow did something to deserve it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe widely held belief that black people \u201cdeserve it\u201d is so pervasive that it doesn\u2019t ever need to be said. It is embodied in every person who suggests that Trayvon Martin shouldn\u2019t have been wearing that hoodie; that Rekia Boyd shouldn\u2019t have been outside her house; that Michael Brown shouldn\u2019t have talked back; that Aiyana Stanley-Jones shouldn\u2019t have been sleeping in her bed; that Tamir Rice shouldn\u2019t have been playing in the park; that Sandra Bland shouldn\u2019t have been driving her car.\n\nThis hideously loaded conclusion is something that black children become aware of as soon as the outside world becomes aware of them. We are taught that our lives have less value and that people can both fear us and not be fearful of us, as we wield no real power of which to be afraid. We learn about our people and ourselves from anyone who does not look like us. We are not believed when we tell the truth. We are made to believe that we deserve poverty, food deserts and over-policed, treeless communities.\n\nIt is a terrible thing when people in a society accept that another group is beneath them; it is worse still to be those underfoot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it saddens me to say that this moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children. The rush of support for the Parkland youths from mainstream-media spots, to sizable financial contributions from celebrities, to high-powered activists helping to organize their march and amplify their work, is exactly what young people deserve\u2014and it\u2019s why the drastic difference in how Black Lives Matter was received is all the more apparent.\n\nM4BL made it possible for the Parkland resistance to exist as it does today. The Parkland students are interrupting politicians who refuse to speak to real issues. They are planning a march. They have multiple emerging faces of leadership. These are precisely the same tactics designed by the young people in M4BL when they were confronted with gun violence in their communities; the only difference of consequence is that the latter group is black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis moment serves to remind black youths that the world cares less about them than it does other children.\n\nIt is because of this reality that youths in M4BL had to do it alone, largely abandoned by society, and still managed to influence every societal level from culture to Congress. These young people were told repeatedly, from every side, that no one would assist them because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d If a dearth of leadership were actually the problem, wouldn\u2019t efforts to build up black leadership have appeared in the same ways that they are so readily available for Parkland youths now? Where were these efforts a few short years ago?\n\nTo be black in this world is to know that what is acceptable in the actions of other people is unacceptable in you. The double standard in protest is no exception when tactics informed by black resistance, like disruption, are celebrated unless black people are the ones doing the disrupting. Our attempts to wrest for ourselves the very basic dignities and rights that all human beings should enjoy results in our being hunted as \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the heart of the matter: There isn\u2019t one black person I know who isn\u2019t supportive of the Parkland youths, and who isn\u2019t also hurting from the constant reminder that we are undeserving of the same love and support.\n\nAs America tries once again to forge a new dream of itself, we cannot negate the reality that the very presence of those denied the dream only serves to destroy it. Black people cannot be treated as if the issues that impact us are ours alone when they are connected to the entire structuring of the Western world. If history has taught us anything, it is that no real progress is possible without the presence of black people. True progress begins when we show up for black youths who have the courage to fight for a world better than the one they inherited.\n\nJanaya Khan is a lecturer, author and co-creator of Black Lives Matter Canada.

We wanted nudes, too!\n\nWell, the pioneering brand heard our cry. On Thursday, Nubian Skin introduced a three-part-cup bra\u2014a cup cut and sewn in three parts, to better support fuller breasts\u2014available up to a 40G in its signature array of shades. In addition, it introduced a nonpadded underwire bra available up to a 40D and to DD in smaller sizes. Both are perfect for pairing with Nubian Skin\u2019s array of panty styles, which are available up to an XXL. As Nubian Skin\u2019s founder, Ade Hassan, explains in a press release:\n\nWe are very excited to be introducing this new range of bras and offering our customers more options in sizes. We\u2019ve been paying close attention to our [customers\u2019] needs. It is very important to be able to offer all women of colour our products, and we\u2019re hoping that expanding our size range will take us one step closer!\n\nObviously, this is thrilling news for those of us who have struggled to find nude lingerie in less conventional sizes. We applaud Nubian Skin for its responsiveness to its customer base\u2014it\u2019s a move we\u2019re sure will be mutually beneficial!\n\nThe Glow Up tip: Nubian Skin\u2019s full product range\u2014which includes bras, panties, hosiery, nightwear and even nude-toned leather shoes!\u2014is priced from $15 to $130.

Her job as a mouthpiece for the NRA is to shift the focus from looking at gun laws to looking at anything but gun laws.\n\nSeriously, she doesn\u2019t care if the focus goes from the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to the county sheriff\u2019s department, which she tried to accomplish during a CNN town hall. She doesn\u2019t care if the focus shifts to the FBI, the students or even the media, as long as it isn\u2019t on the NRA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s her job and she\u2019s doing it well. Because Loesch isn\u2019t just a paid talking head; she\u2019s a gun-loving nut, and I say this with all due respect.\n\nAccording to CNN, she\u2019s authored a book called Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America, in which she focuses on the history of the Second Amendment and explains what \u201cgun confiscation would mean to Americans\u2019 basic rights as citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd she even has a tattoo on her right forearm of a biblical verse from the book of Ephesians that is a call to Christians to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d in order to protect themselves from evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep. So it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Loesch said some really crazy shit.\n\n\u201cMany in legacy media love mass shootings. You guys love it,\u201d Loesch said Thursday. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not saying that you love the tragedy. But I am saying that you love the ratings. Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back [of the room].\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd notice I said \u2018crying white mothers,\u2019 because there are thousands of grieving black mothers in Chicago every weekend, and you don\u2019t see town halls for them, do you?\u201d Loesch asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the CNN town hall for Chicago? Where\u2019s the CNN town hall for sanctuary cities?\u201d\n\nAt this point, it would have been nice if someone from \u201clegacy\u201d media had snatched the microphone from Loesch and ordered the entire CPAC evacuated so that Loesch could have had her choice of several seats.\n\nSeriously, the Chicago gun thing is just a tired cacophony of racist dog whistles the NRA blows whenever there is a push to change gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root staff writer Michael Harriot explored the Chicago gun issue in an article last year:\n\nWe know that crime rates in Chicago are on par with those of most major cities in America\u2014until you factor in gun violence. When they try to figure out why cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and New York don\u2019t have as many gun deaths as Chicago, they point the finger at gangs and \u201cthugs\u201d and ignore the elephant in the room: the state of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws. Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA. In fact, Chicago ....\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, you\u2019re doing it.\n\nDoing what?\n\nMoving away from the issue at hand and trying to prove a point that has nothing to do with the actual topic, which is that kids were killed in Parkland because an 18-year-old can buy an assault rifle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamn, she\u2019s good.\n\nThat\u2019s how the NRA continues to shift the argument from guns to bump stocks. It\u2019s how the NRA shifts the blame from mass murder to the media. It\u2019s how the NRA makes a story about a mass shooter and how easy it was to get his hands on several weapons into a story about Chicago gun violence.\n\nDon\u2019t be tricked, America, and by \u201cAmerica,\u201d I mean all of us who didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. This is a long con game that\u2019s rolled out whenever a shooting happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will say anything to take the focus off guns, and I know it seems low, even for the NRA, to argue that the media loves crying white mothers just days after a tragedy, but nothing is off the table when it comes to preventing Congress from changing gun laws, and this performance from the soulless and deranged Dana Loesch is proof.", "keywords": ["mothers", "town", "gun", "nra", "white", "spokeswoman", "ratings", "shes", "love", "mass", "gold", "loves", "loesch", "shootings", "chicago", "media"], "polarity": 0.06412649850149849, "subjectivity": 0.4381139693639693},

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["celebrate", "nra", "gun", "rick", "yes", "gov", "scott", "school", "mental", "health", "law", "enforcement", "proposed", "weapons", "florida", "trump", "shouldnt", "ranks"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["notes", "white", "going", "listening", "school", "president", "teachers", "teacher", "violent", "remember", "victims", "house", "trump", "massshooting", "check", "care"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

Featuring model Amy Deanna, who has vitiligo, the cosmetics company takes an unconventional turn by not trying to cover up Deanna\u2019s skin, but enhancing its uniqueness.\n\nIn the 15-second spot, Deanna applies two shades of Cover Girl\u2019s truBlend foundation to match her contrasting skin tones. Choosing to cover some spots while matching others, she asks: \u201cWhy try to blend in, when you can choose to stand out?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a refreshing take on a condition that reportedly affects about 1%-2% of the population, and has only in recent years begun to receive positive attention.

But, mostly, as a light-skinned, nonbiracial, hopefully self-aware black woman, I felt painfully aware that conversations about colorism are still uncomfortable for me\u2014and, often, should be.\n\nThose aren\u2019t \u201clight-skinned tears\u201d\u2014or light-skinned guilt\u2014just a simple admission that I\u2019m occasionally challenged by how to honestly and effectively address privilege and oppression in the same space and breath. Because while I can readily acknowledge the many ways my privilege overrides my oppression\u2014including the \u201cpretty privilege\u201d that afforded me a modeling career (albeit as a plus model, which is another story)\u2014it\u2019s a balancing act to do so without throwing my own experiences under the bus. (Because contrary to the popular belief espoused above, light-skinned women aren\u2019t actually \u201cbroken down that easy.\u201d)\n\nBut it\u2019s necessary work and therefore, a discussion I continue to have with myself. I\u2019d hope (wish?) that white women would have similar discussions with themselves as they approach the intersection of racism and feminism, and that black men would do the same as they consider the benefits and functions of patriarchy, as well as cis-hetero white men in relation to ... well, everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so on, and so on. ... For instance, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re enjoying a first-world, net-neutral (for now) privilege, in and of itself. But the best way to deconstruct someone else\u2019s privilege and resulting pathology is to first make sense of your own. You know\u2014oxygen masks, and all that.\n\nAnd what better place to have that conversation than here at The Glow Up?\n\nVeronica Webb and I crafted this space with a mission: to represent, inspire and empower all iterations of black womanhood. How can we do that by ignoring the rainbow in the room? And no, that doesn\u2019t just mean simply addressing the issues and needs of our LGBTQ sisters, but the full spectrum of shades in which black women arrive, whenever and wherever they enter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not ignorant or dismissive of the optics: No matter how well-meaning or qualified, can two black women privileged in seemingly similar ways ensure that The Glow Up will be\u2014for lack of a less-clich\u00e9d word\u2014inclusive?\n\nThree weeks in, we\u2019re a work in progress, and I hope we always will be. Even during our brief tenure, we\u2019ve already faced concerns of elitism and being too \u201ckumbaya\u201d about colorism. So this video inspired me to initiate a conversation we all need to be more comfortable having. And before we continue, maybe it\u2019s best to start by saying what many of us wish had been said, in so many instances:\n\nI believe you.\n\nWhatever your experience with colorism is, it\u2019s not for me to explain away, or turn into something more comfortable for me to digest. I will not use denial to \u201cwhat about\u201d anyone into submission. My job\u2014especially here\u2014is to listen, observe, empathize when possible, act when necessary and to trust what I\u2019m hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe you. I hope you\u2019ll believe me, too.\n\n\n\nBecause while I\u2019m not \u201ckumbaya\u201d enough to think that belief alone is enough to heal the damage of colorism, I am humble enough to admit that I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019ve been fetishized because of my color more than I\u2019ve been rejected. I know I\u2019ve been rejected, in turn. I also know that I can\u2019t speak for anyone\u2019s experience but my own; but above all else, I know that this shit does a deep disservice to us all\u2014especially us women.\n\nWhen I shared this film with a few colleagues, one of them questioned its effectiveness, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this video is trying to do. It\u2019s just a bunch of insults while images of normal, attractive women stand around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, I agree. So, when I ask how a film like the one above makes you feel, it\u2019s because we need to know, and we need to talk about it. We need to be honest about where this ongoing issue sits in our bodies, and under our skins, individually and collectively. And then we need to believe one another. As a colored girl, I need to be able to speak, write and think openly about colorism\u2014and I still have much to learn.

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["probably", "students", "day", "shit", "arming", "going", "student", "teachers", "school", "policy", "class", "worst", "suggestions", "chris", "teacher"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

Unlike the National Rifle Association, the top gang thugs in Chicago don\u2019t have a multibillion-dollar lobbying wing that bought and paid for the Republican Party.\n\nThe entire gun culture in Chicago thrives off of Illinois\u2019 lax gun laws, and as such, guess who wins? The NRA.

Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald.

I also believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides us the right to gun ownership, and there is a need for commonsense gun legislation.\n\n\n\nI believe in the right to vote, but recognize that I must register and provide proof of identity. I believe in freedom of assembly, but I know that I can\u2019t organize a parade on the busiest intersection of my city without a permit. Every right afforded by the Constitution is regulated. While this may seem obvious, I point this out because someone will inevitably raise the idiotic argument that the ultimate goal of anyone in favor of gun control legislation is to kick in your door, snatch your weapons, drink the last bit of Kool-Aid and eat the big piece of chicken.\n\nAfter the most recent mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. (which may not be the most recent by the time I finish this sentence), some have theorized that one way to force gun control is to pit the intersecting groups in the Venn diagram of conservatism against each other. The argument is, if black people started purchasing firearms in bulk, conservative racists (or is it \u201cracist conservatives\u201d? I get confused sometimes) might get so outraged at the thought of gun-toting Negroes that racism might overwhelm their natural predilection for firearms and cause them to support gun-reform laws.\n\nThe argument is not without merit. I\u2019ve even said it before. White men have always been afraid of armed black people. The 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law, was passed, in part, because during Reconstruction, the South was inundated with newly formed groups dedicated to disarming blacks. The most famous of these organizations was a fraternity of men who called themselves the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia Gov. Ronald Reagan fought for gun control legislation after another group of black men called Black Panthers marched on California\u2019s Capitol carrying shotguns. California\u2019s Mulford Act eventually became the blueprint for the Gun Control Act of 1968, the law banning felons from owning firearms and outlawing Saturday night specials, cheap handguns associated with black communities.\n\nThis makes the math seem simple: If black people arm themselves, America always figures out a way to disarm them through legislation. While no one doubts the strength of the American brand of racism, the theoretical use of America\u2019s anti-black sentiment as a legislative, race-based Jedi mind trick ignores an important reality: It won\u2019t work.\n\nWhen people talk about commonsense gun legislation, we wrongly assume that rank-and-file Republican voters are against it. However, 70 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of all Americans favor banning assault-style weapons, according to an October 2017 Gallup Poll. A 2016 CNN poll (pdf) showed that 92 percent of white people favored universal background checks, and 89 percent of whites favored stopping felons and people with mental health issues from owning guns.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the prevailing narrative would have you believe that gun owners are against gun reform, they are not. There is only one entity preventing legislative gun reform, and it is not Republicans, white people or even gun owners.\n\nIt is the National Rifle Association.\n\nTo be clear, it is not the members of the NRA who oppose gun control. Data from Pew research shows that the majority of NRA members are in favor of universal background checks, closing gun-show loopholes and preventing the mentally ill from purchasing weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the NRA boasts 4.5 million members (a dubious claim that most researchers don\u2019t believe), the NRA\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t come from its member rolls. The organization\u2019s power comes from its ability to lobby lawmakers, essentially bribing them with barrels of cash. More important, the stacks of money don\u2019t come from dues; they come from gun manufacturers.\n\nThe reason there is not gun reform is that the NRA is not the mythical nationwide coterie of gun nuts that most people would have you believe. It represents gun manufacturers, and gun manufacturers wouldn\u2019t care if black people bought guns. In fact, they\u2019d love it.\n\nFor instance, there are millions of people who donate to the NRA who have no idea they are doing so. Sturm, Ruger manufactured more than 1.6 million guns in 2017 and gave $1 to the NRA every time it sold a firearm. The Taurus company buys a year\u2019s membership for every person who purchases one of its guns, about 92,000 in 2012, according to Shooting Industry. There are shooting ranges across the country that include an NRA membership in the cost of their visits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are millions of Nation Rifle Association members who have no idea they are in the NRA! Advertising, sponsorships and corporate donations account for most of the money received by the NRA. Less than half of the money the NRA rolls out to purchase the souls of politicians in exchange for the blood of children comes from membership dues.\n\nBecause of this, the NRA is not beholden to its rank and file. It has become the lobbying wing of the gun industry, and there is only one thing stronger than racism in America:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreed.\n\nThe prospect of black people armed to the teeth is actually a good thing for the NRA because it is the de facto supplier of America\u2019s addiction. Thinking that the NRA will ever be concerned about a 12-point rise in African-American gun ownership (the increase that would raise black gun ownership to 36 percent, the same as whites) is like expecting the cigarette industry to care about a rise in black smokers. It just means more money for them.\n\nEven if most white people were racists who were scared shitless because black people started buying AR-15s, the NRA would care as much about that as it cared about dead first-graders in Newtown, Conn., or high school freshmen in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nSo, yes, black people should exercise their right to gun ownership for a number of reasons. But doing so won\u2019t cause the NRA to stop its war against children, no matter how racist or fragile white America may seem.\n\nSadly, two things can be true at the same time.", "keywords": ["buy", "believe", "gun", "war", "wont", "nra", "white", "money", "members", "nras", "stop", "theres", "kids", "black", "theory", "control", "right", "guns", "ownership"], "polarity": 0.04240483654276759, "subjectivity": 0.489879832810867},

As people make custom content and mods, certain ones will rise to the top as particularly attractive or trendy. Right now, thousands of very trendy sims have vitiligo.\n\n\n\nPeople who have vitiligo lose the melanin in their skin\u2014Michael Jackson famously had the condition. The vibrant and very active Sims community on Tumblr is hard to navigate if you\u2019re not embedded in it, but as you scroll through pictures of fans showing off their sims, you start to notice trends. Full Kylie Jenner lips, tattoos, and now sims with the skin condition vitiligo. Giving your sims vitiligo is not an option in the base game, and these fan sims are using custom content. What\u2019s interesting is that one of the most popular vitiligo mods bears a striking resemblance to model Winnie Harlow. If you search \u201csims 4 vitiligo\u201d on YouTube, you\u2019ll get over 3,000 videos named some variation on \u201cVitiligo Beauty,\u201d many of them using the same skin.\n\nWinnie Harlow was once Chantelle Winnie, a contestant on America\u2019s Next Top Model. In her audition, she talks about how she was bullied for her skin as a child, called a cow, having people moo at her, and eventually leaving school. Now, Winnie has modeled for Diesel, Marc Jacobs and Swarovski, as well as making a cameo in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album Lemonade. As she was coming up as a model in 2015, some people were concerned that vitiligo would be seen as a fashion accessory. Some even went as far as to copy the pattern of her vitiligo for Instagram pictures. Winnie, for her part, did not seem all that bothered by it, and said she was pleased that people were \u201crecreating, loving and broadcasting something to the world that once upon a time I cried myself to sleep over.\u201d But even in her audition for ANTM, host Tyra Banks notes the unusual, symmetrical pattern the vitiligo has created on her face as particularly beautiful. The mildly fetishistic tone she has while referring to a skin condition that about 50 million people have is just a bit gross, to say the least.\n\nNot everyone who makes a sim with vitiligo is necessarily inspired by Harlow. There are, of course, simmers with the condition who just want to make sims that look like them, or simmers that want to make their games as diverse as the world is. YouTuber Xmiramira, who also runs a forum and Tumblr called The Black Simmer, says that she makes sims with vitiligo. \u201cThere are so many types of people that are severely underrepresented in The Sims community so I actually got hype when I found vitiligo [Custom Content],\u201d she said over Twitter direct messages. She said that she believes that vitiligo should be in the base game.

If you\u2019re making a sim and want it to be beautiful, then this particular skin seems like an obvious choice. At the same time, this is a very literal commodification of a human being. Vitiligo manifests differently for everyone who has it. Only making sims who resemble Winnie Harlow feels more about fashion than representation.\n\n\n\nIn the words of Xmiramira, \u201cPeople\u2019s skin condition shouldn\u2019t be treated like a trend.

You asked, and I got the answers on the best chemical peels and lasers for darker skin tones.\n\n\n\nDuring last week\u2019s \u201csnow bomb cyclone,\u201d I checked in with Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained New York City dermatologist, to talk about the latest offerings in her practice. As a black woman herself, she had plenty of advice to offer The Glow Up about using lasers and peels on melanin-rich skin.\n\n\u201cFor the darkest skin types, I like the Clear and Brilliant laser for resurfacing. I will also use the Fraxel laser with lower settings,\u201d Henry says.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used both of these treatments, and they do remove every line and every speck of discoloration on the skin. The doctor warns that the effects aren\u2019t permanent, though. \u201cA newer laser that is safe for all skin types is the Infini laser. It combines microneedling and radio frequency, so it tightens and corrects textural issues,\u201d she says.\n\nThis new generation of lasers allows the physician to tailor the treatment specifically to each issue on a patient\u2019s face, whereas previous generations of lasers obliged the doctor to treat the face with multiple processes. Including microneedling is part of that tailoring, using microscopic needles to puncture the skin, causing controlled wounding that stimulates the natural healing process and the production of collagen, which restores both radiance and elasticity to the surface of the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor specific tightening and toning, Henry says, \u201cI love using the Aerolase 1064 Laser for skin rejuvenation and laser toning in darker skin types.\u201d\n\nDesigned to deal with thicker areas of the skin, this laser is helpful for acne scars, stretch marks, spider veins, keloid revision and fungal issues with nails, among other things. Scars can thankfully now be permanently removed, commonly in about two to four treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the best peels for African-American skin? \u201cMy go-to peels are the Vitalize Peel and VI Peel. Both are very effective but safe for all skin types,\u201d says Henry. \u201cThe VI Peel is a deeper peel, so I use it for hyperpigmentation and textural issues.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve personally used peels, and they\u2019re generally quick and painless\u2014with the exception of a few minutes of stinging or tingling, depending on your level of pain tolerance. During treatment, a small handheld fan is often offered to reduce the temporary stinging sensation. Peels takes about 45 minutes in total, and the downtime is 24 hours without makeup. I\u2019ve yet to try either of Henry\u2019s favorite peels, but I\u2019m about due for one. Once I do, I\u2019ll let you know what the doctor orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, living life brings the fine lines back over time; the better you treat yourself with diet, hydration and exercise, the longer the smoothing effect lasts.\n\nTry to avoid factors like alcohol, junk food and sleep deprivation in order to preserve your investment in any treatment. Sun exposure and hormonal changes can trigger the return of discoloration on the skin. And no matter our skin tone, we should all use products with sun protection factor because cancer\u2014including melanoma\u2014doesn\u2019t discriminate. If you live right, you can get up to two years of lasting effects from these treatments.", "keywords": ["regular", "peels", "life", "laserandpeel", "redcarpet", "lasers", "types", "facetune", "treatment", "doctor", "laser", "using", "plastic", "peel", "surgery", "live", "henry", "skin"], "polarity": 0.21186278368096553, "subjectivity": 0.43090318772136954},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "dont", "terrorist", "nra", "gun", "directly", "second", "nras", "deaths", "right", "legal"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

It\u2019s been that way since I was a kid; now my daughters have those dry little white bumps on the backs of their arms and legs, too.\n\nIt\u2019s a harmless condition called keratosis pilaris, little white bumps that can resemble acne, caused by keratin deposits clogging the pores. About 40 percent of adults are affected by the condition, according to the Mayo Clinic. The effects of this chicken-skin-looking condition can appear more exaggerated in African Americans because we tend to have dry skin to begin with, making the contrast between the white bumps and darker skin more visible.\n\nBut never fear!

Goat\u2019s milk, shea butter, wheat germ and hempseed oil are some of the most moisturizing fats used in formulating natural soaps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAHAs are particularly high in unprocessed goat\u2019s milk and raw shea butters, as well as more expensive oils, like the wheat and hempseed oils mentioned above (which also have a shorter shelf life). The lactic acid contained in these ingredients helps to slough off dead skin cells by breaking down the chemical bonds that hold dead skin cells together. It also increases cellular turnover. Water-based soaps remove dead skin, too, but the ingredients are often chemical and can do more harm than good by causing irritation, resulting in even drier and more sensitive skin.\n\n\n\nBring Your \u201cA\u201d Game\n\nHempseed oil contains vitamin A, which a lot of us know as retinol, the hero ingredient in expensive face creams that fights everything from fine lines to acne\u2014and is also good for the mild relief of psoriasis. Besides that, hempseed oil is one of the most quickly absorbed and least sticky of all the vegetable oils, so it\u2019s great for soaps and cosmetics. Water-based and chemically formulated soaps can be artificially fortified with vitamins, but most aren\u2019t. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want my vitamins added to chemical crap. I want the real thing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreamy and Dreamy\n\nLet\u2019s get to the good stuff: These are my two favorite all-natural soaps, full of fatty goodness: Goat\u2019s Milk Stuff is a farm in Vermont that makes all of its products from raw, unprocessed goat\u2019s milk\u2014from cheese to soap. The soaps are chemical- and packaging-free\u2014a nice nod to keeping it green and clean straight down the line\u2014and the lather is divine.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence.

Featuring model Amy Deanna, who has vitiligo, the cosmetics company takes an unconventional turn by not trying to cover up Deanna\u2019s skin, but enhancing its uniqueness.\n\nIn the 15-second spot, Deanna applies two shades of Cover Girl\u2019s truBlend foundation to match her contrasting skin tones.

In fact, I\u2019ve been struggling with acne for the majority of my life. And as a soon-to-be a member of the Jackie Robinson Club (read: turning 42), my pimples were defending their reign, just as new fine lines started to etch themselves onto my face.\n\nAny product marketed for acne, I\u2019ve tried. Everything from Noxzema to acid peels, I\u2019ve used it. At the very best, some of these products worked for maybe two weeks. Most times, these products not only didn\u2019t work but made my acne worse. At the very worst, I had to resort to getting corticosteroids injected into my most painful pimples\u2014the ones that almost felt like welts underneath my skin.\n\nIn truth, this caused me to feel depressed\u2014it even jump-started my depression at times. And although I thought it was all in my head, as a psychiatrist, I also know that there actually has been a link found between acne and depression.\n\nMany frequent trips to my aesthetician and the dermatologist later, I discovered that prescription Accutane worked well\u2014but only after two different trials of taking the medication. And taking this medication also meant that I had to have monthly blood draws to make sure that my liver enzymes weren\u2019t elevated and that I wasn\u2019t pregnant\u2014since Accutane can cause birth defects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the last year, things thankfully seemed to finally calm down a bit, but I\u2019d still notice that I would always get at least one large pimple right before my period. That\u2019s when I decided to give oil cleansing a shot. The oil cleansing method is a natural, organic method that has been around for centuries and has its roots in Ayurvedic medicine.\n\nPimples are caused by excess oil\u2014or sebum\u2014that the seborrheic glands underneath your skin produce when your skin needs more moisture or when they\u2019re overactive. As counterintuitive as it may sound at first, oil cleansing seeks to restore this balance by providing the oil or moisture that your skin needs, thereby reducing the amount of sebum that your glands are compelled to produce. In theory, oil cleansing should decrease the amount and frequency of breakouts. In my experience, it\u2019s been a godsend.\n\nIn keeping with the natural and Ayurvedic route, I recently stumbled upon incorporating turmeric masks into my daily skin-care routine. According to my aesthetician, celebrity skin expert Tina K, when applied to your skin transdermally, the turmeric in the mask calms down any inflammation that your skin may want to manifest\u2014and there can be a lot, since we\u2019re constantly pounded by environmental toxins day in and day out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result? On several days, I\u2019ve actually been able to leave the house and go to work without wearing a lick of makeup, aside from my beloved lip glosses. And for all of you who want to make sure you truly are what you eat, the best part about turmeric masks is that they\u2019re actually edible, and an ingredient you can use inside and out.\n\nWe\u2019ve extolled the benefits of honey before here at The Glow Up, and adding honey to my masks keeps my moisturized levels at their peak. An extra added benefit is that as a proud, bald black woman for the past 20-plus years, I find that applying honey-and-turmeric masks to my head after I shave has eliminated my razor bumps. (Take note, fellow baldies.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experience as both a patient and a doctor, I\u2019ve always found that utilizing a combination of Western medicine and more-natural treatments has given me the best success when it comes to any conditions or ailments I might have. Acne can be a real pain to get rid of\u2014literally.

That said, I occasionally get my fix by drifting through its virtual aisles and living vicariously through friends\u2019 shopping sprees, which is why I was eager to know what Yesha Callahan, deputy managing editor of The Root, scored on a recent trip.\n\nAside from second-guessing an impulse-splurge on cult skin care fave T.L.C. Sukari Babyfacial from Drunk Elephant, she had one question: \u201cWhy is there a brand there that sells a $38 jar of coconut oil?\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I was intrigued; after all, it\u2019s also the season of peak moisturizing. I rushed to Sephora\u2019s site, determined to see for myself. And there it was: a 7-ounce, $38 jar of Coconut Melt, courtesy of Kopari Beauty, a Pacific-based brand that markets tropical beauty.\n\nSure that both Yesha and I had missed something, I checked the ingredients:\n\n\n\n\u201c100% Organic Coconut Oil\u201d\n\nJust to clarify, Kopari insists that this is \u201cnot your kitchen coconut oil.\u201d As detailed in its product description:\n\nKopari tested dozens of coconut oils from all over the world and discovered the most premium for use on both skin and hair. Like fine wine or olive oil, the quality of the fruit as well as where and how it is harvested makes all the difference. Kopari\u2019s coconut oil is sustainably sourced from small family farms in the Philippines and made from fresh, virgin, and 100 percent organic coconuts. The quality, texture, absorption, and aroma is unlike any other oil on the market.

But when it comes to coconut oil intended for external use, you generally just need to know two things: whether it\u2019s organic and unrefined, because these are the best qualities for topical use.\n\n\n\nBut just to make sure I wasn\u2019t tripping, I did a Facebook snap poll, garnering results from women of all races\u2014and a few men. For the sake of our core demographic here at The Glow Up, I\u2019ll just include the responses from black women:\n\n\n\n\u201c7oz?! Not when Costco got a gallon for less than that. I\u2019m judging ... I thought it was going to have some added ingredients for that price. Like unicorn tears or something.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a no from me. The organic (no coconut smell!)

It is difficult for Americans to come to a consensus on almost anything. Some people think Kevin Hart is funny.

(She isn\u2019t a white supremacist or anything, but she did say that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts are better than Krispy Kremes, which is kind of Hitler-ish, in my opinion.)\n\nIf there is one thing on which we can all agree, I have always assumed, it\u2019s that as a society, we all think murdering children is\u2014at the very least\u2014not a good look.\n\nApparently, I was wrong.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a baby-murdering white guy walked into a church and opened fire, killing people as young as 17 months old. In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time.

The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle go out in his truck and shoot [the gunman] and hit him and neutralize him,\u201d Trump said, referring to Stephen Willeford, the Texas man credited with shooting and chasing off the Sutherland gunman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nThis point\u2014a common conservative refrain\u2014is worth pausing on.\n\nShockingly, there is a bit of nuance that Trump inadvertently introduces. Per our current gun laws, Devin Kelley, the gunman in Sutherland Springs, should never have had a gun in the first place. Kelly\u2019s domestic violence charges were never entered into a national database, allowing him to pass background checks and buy firearms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is important to remember: We can have the right laws in place, but it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re not being enforced properly.\n\nStill, the focus on the \u201cgood guy with the gun\u201d being unable to purchase his firearm is ridiculous\u2014there is simply no way of knowing that for sure. News outlets are reporting that Willeford had a rifle and not the sort of semi-automatic weapon that would likely be subject to \u201cextreme gun vetting.\u201d (It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Willeford, as a former National Rifle Association instructor, was also a highly trained marksman, which is not true of many gun owners.)\n\nProclaiming that \u201chundreds\u201d more could have died, so we must be glad that only 26 lives were lost, is shameful and indicates how normalized mass murder has become in the U.S. As USA Today reports, 208 people have died in mass shootings this year alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, the reporter asked Trump whether he would consider any gun control policy.\n\n\u201cThe city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster,\u201d Trump answered, brandishing a favorite and demonstrably false response that, in fact, highlights the need for federal gun regulations.\n\nAs a recent NPR fact check noted, Chicago\u2019s gun laws, while tough, are certainly not the strongest in the country. And while the state of Illinois is tough on guns, its neighboring states, Wisconsin and Indiana, aren\u2019t. Guns, like people, can easily move across state borders, and evidence shows that a significant percentage of Chicago\u2019s guns are trafficked in from states with lax gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than talk about Chicago again, the dotard in chief could very well have used South Korea as an example. The last deadly shootings in the country happened in 2015, in two back-to-back incidents. Immediately following the shootings (quite literally, on the first business day after the last incident), the South Korean government moved to track all guns in the country via GPS.\n\nRead more at NBC News.", "keywords": ["shooting", "gun", "claims", "reporter", "south", "demented", "laws", "extreme", "difference", "vetting", "korea", "cheese", "mass", "grit", "control", "latest", "trump", "guns"], "polarity": 0.05356373256373256, "subjectivity": 0.5341286676286676},

What is to blame for this? Regarding the recent Texas church massacre, President Donald Trump stated that this was caused by a \u201cmental health problem.\u201d\n\nIn other words, guns don\u2019t kill people ... yeah, let me stop you there and dispel that myth. In 2015, suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States. A total of 22,018 people used a firearm to commit suicide. Adding to that number, with the 12,979 homicides that were carried out using a firearm, there were 34,997 total deaths caused by firearm in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only November, but 2017 has been considered the deadliest year for mass shootings in modern U.S. history. This despite the fact that the 1921 Tulsa, Okla., race riot; the 1923 Rosewood, Fla., massacre; and the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee, just to name a few, all had greater tragic losses of life in a single instance in this country.\n\n\n\nFor the record, the current federal definition of a mass killing (pdf) is \u201cthree or more killings in a single incident and must occur in a place of public use.\u201d So far, there have been 112 people killed and 531 people wounded in mass shootings this year. To put it bluntly, guns definitely kill people ... a lot of people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s answer to these violent events is a very convenient and plausible excuse for the population as it pertains to mental health because of two things: 1) the population doesn\u2019t know a lot about mental illness to begin with, and 2) they don\u2019t want to know about mental illness. So this seems like it would make sense.\n\nBut people who have more than just a cursory knowledge of mental illness will tell you that this likely isn\u2019t mental illness.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s line of thinking has been a popular excuse for people committing violent crimes and crimes in general. But mental illness is responsible only for 3 to 5 percent of violent crimes. This means that the people who are committing violent crimes are far more likely\u201419 times more likely\u2014not to have a mental illness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good rule of thumb for most things is to understand one main concept: There is a difference between mental illness and bad behavior.\n\n\n\nJust because someone does something that is unusual or not normal to you does not mean, by default, that someone is mentally ill. I get it\u2014these events cause shock, disgust and make you feel sick. However, if there is no evaluation, you should probably err on the side of bad behavior. If the shooter was killed, there is little else to go off of other than family members, who might suffer from recall or responder bias, which makes any evaluation ultimately unreliable.\n\nA person who has not previously been diagnosed with a mental illness and who commits a violent crime is likely not suffering from mental illness and is probably just evil. Yes, I know, there is no Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 designation for being evil. Which is why being a bad person isn\u2019t a mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is more likely that these are horrible people with poor coping skills ... and access to firearms. Don\u2019t believe me? OK, consider this: If someone shot and killed your relative, what are you thinking of first? That the shooter had a mental illness or that the shooter was simply a horrible person? Exactly.\n\n\n\nNeed another example? OK. What if your roommate was secretly poisoning you and posting on Instagram step-by-step everything she or he did to you? Would you think that your roommate had a mental illness or that your roommate was a horrible person? Too easy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you noticed that with respect to people who commit a violent crime, the benefit of the doubt about whether they\u2019re suffering from mental illness is inversely proportional to the amount of melanin in their body?\n\n\n\nIf you have a lot of melanin, you are considered a thug, a terrorist and un-American. However, if you have very little melanin, you are mentally ill and are worthy of people suggesting that you had an undiagnosed, and unknown, mental illness, personality disorder or any number of other maladies, and you deserve some compassion.\n\nAfter all, why else would someone with privilege commit a crime? Affluenza, anyone?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not caping for terrorism, foreign or domestic.\n\nHowever, the selective framing and cognitive dissonance that seems to dominate the narrative of these types of incidents makes the optics of perceptions of mental illness and mental health look bad, and it is the wrong way to address these events.\n\n\n\nThe ramification of using mental illness as a scapegoat increases the stigma that is attached to mental illness. This stigma makes people far less likely to seek out professional help to improve their mental health. Not to mention it also increases the criminalization of mental illness, when, in fact, people who have mental illness are 10 times more likely to be the victims of violent crime, not the perpetrators of crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t expect Congress to do anything about it. It did nothing when the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shootings occurred in Newtown, Conn. Hell, members of Congress were actually shot at and kept right on going like nothing happened.

They are dealing with mental health challenges as they struggle to understand why their loved ones were tragically taken away and why the government repeatedly fails to prevent these senseless losses of life caused by people behaving badly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough, if this is a mental health problem, perhaps Trump is to blame, because he did sign into law a bill that rolled back an Obama-administration measure that had made it harder for people with mental illness to procure firearms.\n\n\n\nBut when you have shock, disgust and emotion, who needs facts?\n\n\n\nTerrance McGill, M.D., MPH, specializes in preventive medicine, mental health and addiction medicine.

According to The New York Times, this amounts to some 7% of the town\u2019s population. While details are still unspooling, the county sheriff told The Washington Post that a large number of the victims\u2014somewhere between 12 to 14 of the people who were killed and injured\u2014were children. According to state officials, a child as young as 18 months was among the dead.\n\n\n\nThe massacre in Texas is the deadliest mass shooting of children since Sandy Hook. People will mourn the loss of these young lives as a wake-up call for gun control. But while the shooting in Texas was undeniably gruesome, it was not a unique incident for children in this country. The fact is that in America, more children are shot on a daily basis than the number that were shot in Texas on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study on children and firearm injuries, published in the journal Pediatrics in June by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas, approximately 19 children a day die or receive emergency treatment for a gunshot wound in the United States. The study, which is one of the most comprehensive of its kind, found that in total, between 2012 and 2014, an average of nearly 1,300 children died and 5,790 were treated for gunshot wounds every year.\n\nAnother analysis by The Washington Post using more recent data from 2015 found that on average, 23 children were shot each day that year. This is a uniquely American problem\u2014one study published in the American Journal of Medicine found that in 2010, among high-income countries, 91 percent of children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms came from the United States.\n\nChildren are shot on a daily basis, but the epidemic largely gets swept under the rug outside of the shock of mass shootings like those in Texas and Sandy Hook. This might have to do with the racial disparity of which children are affected by gun violence\u2014according to the Pediatrics study, black children have the highest rate of firearm mortality overall, at 4.1 per 100,000 versus 1.5 per 100,000 for white children. While white and American Indian children have higher rates of death by firearm suicide, the disparity mostly results from black children having higher rates of death by firearm homicides. A huge proportion of these children who die from firearms overall\u201482 percent\u2014are male, and most are older, between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened in Texas is horrifying. But as we go through the ritualistic steps of processing the massacres that have become woven into the fabric of American life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we simply can\u2019t talk about gun violence without addressing the fact that children, disproportionately black boys, are dying every day. And those who survive gun violence face ongoing trauma.\n\n\u201cWhen the physical wound is repaired, there\u2019s still another wound\u2014one that can be lifelong,\u201d Arthur Lurigio, a clinical psychologist, told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cOnce a child has been shot, their illusion of safety is completely and utterly shattered.\u201d\n\nAccording to another CDC report, increased risk for youth violence and crime is associated with many factors, including concentrated poverty, unemployment, crowded housing, and neighborhood violence and crime. When looking at the problem of gun violence and children as a whole, it\u2019s clear that tighter gun laws are an important, but only partial, solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout putting this reality at the front and center, the gun control debate has too much potential to err on the side of increasing the policing of minorities rather than fixing the root problems that engender gun violence. For example, as Patrick Blanchfield pointed out in an essay for n+1 last year, the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was part of the larger crime bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that produced many of the frameworks for mass incarceration, like harsh sentencing guidelines and billions in funding for new prison construction. Blanchfield writes:\n\nGiven that today\u2019s Aversive Minimalists include many white liberals whose primary concerns vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cgun violence\u201d more or less boil down to making high-profile rampage killings disappear from their newsfeeds, the possibility that they will embrace measures that gesture at solving that problem while doubling down on militarized policing, surveillance, and America\u2019s overcrowded prisons is depressingly easy to imagine. As many critics have observed, we would be na\u00efve to think that heavy-handed gun control measures would not involve the same disproportionate racial targeting and police violence we rightly condemn in the War on Drugs and in everyday encounters in places from Baltimore to Ferguson to Cleveland to Oakland.\n\nThe gun control debate often swirls around the trends illuminated by the massacre of the month. By failing to focus on the overall issue\u2014one that is inextricably linked with poverty, segregation, and racism\u2014children will continue to suffer. That somewhere around a dozen children were shot in Texas on Sunday is a tragedy, but it\u2019s also one that families face across the country every single day.\n\n", "keywords": ["day", "gun", "shot", "american", "firearm", "children", "number", "kids", "violence", "america", "control", "texas", "study", "killed"], "polarity": 0.05063679288362833, "subjectivity": 0.4107891756625934},

But this isn\u2019t a guns situation,\u201d he added.\n\nTime notes that Trump made his comments after a reporter asked about gun-control measures in light of another mass shooting in the U.S. during a joint press conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. However, Trump brushed the question off, saying it was \u201ca little bit soon\u201d to be discussing guns, despite the recent proliferation of mass shootings across the country and the thousands who lose their lives each year to gun violence.\n\n\u201cFortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction; otherwise it [wouldn\u2019t] have been as bad as it was \u2026 it would have been much worse,\u201d Trump said, referring to a local man who grabbed his own rifle and chased the shooter after the carnage at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, despite Trump\u2019s claims, it currently remains unclear if the shooter, identified as 26-year-old Devin P. Kelley, showed any signs of mental illness, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nKelley did, however, receive a bad-conduct discharge from the Air Force three years ago after he was court-martialed and convicted of assaulting his spouse and their child.\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times:\n\nFederal law prohibits a person who has been dishonorably discharged from buying a firearm. Whether Kelley\u2019s discharge would trigger the law was not immediately clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times also notes:\n\nThe 1968 Gun Control Act made it unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell a weapon to a person with a dishonorable discharge or for such a person \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d\n\nKelley was sentenced to 12 months in custody.\n\nAfter his prison stint, Kelley was reduced in rank until he was ultimately released from the military on a bad-conduct discharge in 2014, the Washington Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthorities found several weapons in Kelley\u2019s vehicle after he died, although it is not clear how he got them.\n\nIf the law should have prevented Kelley from getting his hands on firearms, it definitely sounds like there\u2019s a lot more going on than a mental health issue. But we know how the dialogue goes. More and more people die, there are no safe places, and the finger is pointed everywhere except at the smoking gun.", "keywords": ["shooting", "gun", "person", "mental", "kelley", "discharge", "law", "mass", "problem", "lot", "trump", "texas", "health"], "polarity": -0.02006578947368422, "subjectivity": 0.39583333333333326},

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut by then it was already too late. Beauty influencers like Jackie Aina, Makeupshayla and Alissa Ashley took to their social media accounts and promptly got to roasting. It was so delicious, I almost stopped the videos to go grab marshmallows from the kitchen (every good roast has marshmallows).\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s sad, really. Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it. We\u2019re not only vocally speaking out, but we\u2019re also speaking with our dollars. We\u2019re supporting brands that support us, because companies will continue to think it\u2019s OK to underrepresent WOC until we show them otherwise. And we can show them otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["brand", "makeup", "going", "excluding", "color", "launch", "beige", "fenty", "brands", "tarte", "shades", "50", "beauty"], "polarity": 0.045807165376130894, "subjectivity": 0.5063292518464932},

It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked. Internships are a critical part of the process for successful careers, and Fashion Tech Connects is there to provide qualified candidates with both education and, for those who rise to the top, entree into coveted fashion internships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we look at the current landscape of technology and fashion leadership, there is an obvious lack of women of color,\u201d says Horton, whose new executive role at Alexander Wang was reportedly the inspiration behind this season\u2019s fashion show, featuring models dressed as an army of high-powered female executives.\n\nIf Horton has her way, squads of black female power brokers are about to be on the next runway to reality 2.0.", "keywords": ["business", "stephanie", "horton", "york", "alexander", "wang", "women", "doesnt", "soars", "tech", "marketing", "fashion", "vogue", "executive"], "polarity": 0.19978698550127125, "subjectivity": 0.4454098811241669},

If she has her way, the power and impact of African-American contribution to fashion design will be eternal.\n\nTo that end, Henderson gathered together a powerhouse crew of New York\u2019s most influential black bloggers, editors and journalists for the first Black Fashion History Dinner on the eve of New York Fashion Week 2018. Famed restaurant Red Rooster of Harlem was the venue for a panel discussion featuring star guest Dapper Dan, among others, moderated by veteran fashion journalist Teri Agins, who is the author of the insider fashion books The End of Fashion and Hijacking the Runway.\n\nThe discussion opened with Agins declaring that \u201ccollaboration is the future of fashion!\u201d Dapper Dan\u2014now collaborating with former fashion foe Gucci from a newly refurbished townhouse in Harlem that\u2019s Gucci branded from stoop to roof\u2014dove right in on the subject:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe difference between me and a designer is that they create from their [own] minds,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people need a say in how they look.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome say that Dapper Dan, through his early-\u201980s remixing of logo brands like Gucci, MCM and Louis Vuitton into one-of-a-kind pieces for the hip-hop and elite street hustlers, defined a golden era of fashion. There was a time when Dan was known as the \u201cKing of Counterfeit\u201d for reworking motifs of European heritage designers infused with an uptown swagger\u2014most recognizably his custom leather tracksuits hand-screened with LV and Gucci logos that caused the conglomerates to sue him out of business 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do knockoffs; I do knock-ups,\u201d he told the crowd\n\nCollaboration is the cornerstone of Dan\u2019s business, from his customers\u2014\u201cAlthough sometimes I do have to tell people what they have in their mind won\u2019t work in reality,\u201d he says\u2014to huge corporations like Gucci. He kept the Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row crowd laughing and learning, especially when it came to the subject of business. His multiyear deal with luxury powerhouse Kering\u2014underwriters of Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent, among other labels\u2014is one that he held out for in negotiations, saying, \u201cI wanted a partnership where I can be on the same trajectory, producing with the same dignity and respect as Tom Ford or Marc Jacobs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Dap advised younger designers that \u201ctechnology is the palette of the future,\u201d his closing wisdom was about preserving our legacy: \u201cHarlem has a global [design] currency that we need to hold on to, not let it go like we let Harlem go with gentrification.\u201d\n\nPost-panel, Omar Salam, a relative unknown, yet one of the most skilled and exciting designers now showing, gave a knockout presentation of his Sukeina line. Salaam killed it with marabou-trimmed cocktail dresses, structured jackets and sleek sheaths with embroidered bodices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarlem\u2019s Fashion Row gave us a very bright glimpse at black fashion\u2019s future built on our fashion legacy. The evening\u2019s mission? To harness our collective power to share information and make black-owned businesses grow.\n\nSharing information is exactly how Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row began. By chance, Henderson met Lois Alexander Lane, the fashion historian who founded the now defunct Black Fashion Museum, who at the time was compiling a book project on the history of African-American designers, called Fashion in Color. It was a labor of love, which, upon her death, Lane passed on to Henderson to continue.\n\nHenderson found her calling, and on this evening, with some of black fashion\u2019s most important influencers gathered in one room, she made her mission clear: Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row exists \u201cto present opportunities to expand a designer\u2019s visibility by having them show their collection at events with fashion influencers. Moving forward, our goal is to connect designers with revenue-generating opportunities with large brands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve presented over 50 designers\u2014including CFDA winner Telfar Waraire Boswell\u2014to buyers, press and fashion professionals. Henderson, now profitable through a combination of speaking engagements, corporate-sponsored events and selling designers on her site, developed by Harlem\u2019s Fashion Row, has an even bigger endgame in mind.\n\n\u201cI want to create a label that allows us to work with designers of color across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to use the label to launch the designer with HFR x Designer collaborations that would provide revenue for designers.\u201d\n\nSo what can we do to support the future of black fashion design? \u201cTalk about it. Even if you can\u2019t buy it, talk about it!\u201d Henderson says. Which makes sense: Gucci is not famous in our community because we all buy it but because we all talk about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other thing we can do is support our own legacy. Henderson says: \u201cWe would love people to download our new book, Fashion in Color, on our website. It\u2019s free!

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more.

As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered.

Aliche asks me, if I were to cash them in today, do I know the value of my jewelry or individual retirement account and insurance policies? Admittedly, I don\u2019t.

You asked, and I got the answers on the best chemical peels and lasers for darker skin tones.\n\n\n\nDuring last week\u2019s \u201csnow bomb cyclone,\u201d I checked in with Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained New York City dermatologist, to talk about the latest offerings in her practice. As a black woman herself, she had plenty of advice to offer The Glow Up about using lasers and peels on melanin-rich skin.\n\n\u201cFor the darkest skin types, I like the Clear and Brilliant laser for resurfacing. I will also use the Fraxel laser with lower settings,\u201d Henry says.\n\nI\u2019ve personally used both of these treatments, and they do remove every line and every speck of discoloration on the skin. The doctor warns that the effects aren\u2019t permanent, though. \u201cA newer laser that is safe for all skin types is the Infini laser. It combines microneedling and radio frequency, so it tightens and corrects textural issues,\u201d she says.\n\nThis new generation of lasers allows the physician to tailor the treatment specifically to each issue on a patient\u2019s face, whereas previous generations of lasers obliged the doctor to treat the face with multiple processes. Including microneedling is part of that tailoring, using microscopic needles to puncture the skin, causing controlled wounding that stimulates the natural healing process and the production of collagen, which restores both radiance and elasticity to the surface of the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor specific tightening and toning, Henry says, \u201cI love using the Aerolase 1064 Laser for skin rejuvenation and laser toning in darker skin types.\u201d\n\nDesigned to deal with thicker areas of the skin, this laser is helpful for acne scars, stretch marks, spider veins, keloid revision and fungal issues with nails, among other things. Scars can thankfully now be permanently removed, commonly in about two to four treatments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the best peels for African-American skin? \u201cMy go-to peels are the Vitalize Peel and VI Peel. Both are very effective but safe for all skin types,\u201d says Henry. \u201cThe VI Peel is a deeper peel, so I use it for hyperpigmentation and textural issues.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve personally used peels, and they\u2019re generally quick and painless\u2014with the exception of a few minutes of stinging or tingling, depending on your level of pain tolerance. During treatment, a small handheld fan is often offered to reduce the temporary stinging sensation. Peels takes about 45 minutes in total, and the downtime is 24 hours without makeup. I\u2019ve yet to try either of Henry\u2019s favorite peels, but I\u2019m about due for one. Once I do, I\u2019ll let you know what the doctor orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, living life brings the fine lines back over time; the better you treat yourself with diet, hydration and exercise, the longer the smoothing effect lasts.\n\nTry to avoid factors like alcohol, junk food and sleep deprivation in order to preserve your investment in any treatment. Sun exposure and hormonal changes can trigger the return of discoloration on the skin. And no matter our skin tone, we should all use products with sun protection factor because cancer\u2014including melanoma\u2014doesn\u2019t discriminate. If you live right, you can get up to two years of lasting effects from these treatments.", "keywords": ["regular", "peels", "life", "laserandpeel", "redcarpet", "lasers", "types", "facetune", "treatment", "doctor", "laser", "using", "plastic", "peel", "surgery", "live", "henry", "skin"], "polarity": 0.21186278368096553, "subjectivity": 0.43090318772136954},

She\u2019s built a successful and evolving brand that started on the strength of one product: her best-selling \u201cLip Whip.\u201d Famed for smudge-free saturation in no fewer than 45 shades (and counting), the day-to-night finish is vegan, nontoxic and 100 percent cruelty-free ... and so tough to budge that it requires its own remover.\n\nAccording to Cashmere Nicole, it was a formula built out of necessity:\n\nI think Beauty Bakerie introduced a lifestyle change; a complete makeover or face-lift to how the makeup-application process works, and how we should approach that overall. Putting on makeup is exhausting\u2014I think we just need to be real. ... And then, you want to pile on the layer of being a parent, or the layers of the 9-to-5, or all of the other different obligations that we have as individuals ... And I think that was a big component to me: How do I make this easier for myself? How can I make it through my day without having to be completely flatlined by the makeup-application process?\n\nIt was an instinct that paid off. In six short years, the CEO has guided the brand from a solo venture to a staff of 30, and from lips to full-face glamour. Her Flour setting powders offer the same all-day dependability as her lip colors, and a line of concealers are on deck for 2018. Meanwhile, her eye shadow palettes fly off the shelves of both her online and San Diego Beauty Bakerie boutiques\u2014especially her \u201cCoffee & Cocoa\u201d palette, created for her teenage daughter and emblazoned with her personal and professional motto: \u201cBetter, not bitter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough successful, the past six years have been bittersweet for Cashmere Nicole. Soon after launching Beauty Bakerie in 2011 at the age of 27, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, a recurring prognosis that would eventually require a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. Now 33, she remains optimistic and forward-thinking:\n\nYou know, I often tell people that I\u2019m living in my afterlife, after just going through maybe 10 years of feeling as though a lot of things weren\u2019t working out the way that I would want them to; just setback after setback. So, I think in that process you become a bit conditioned to say, \u201cI\u2019ve got to expect the worst but hope for the best.\u201d And in hindsight, I don\u2019t particularly like that way of thinking. It worked for me at that time, but after going through a life-changing experience with cancer and looking back now, I would say that it\u2019s just better to focus on the things that are working for you\u2014the things that you know you can do for sure\u2014and do away with things that you can\u2019t change.\n\nAnd she\u2019s definitely changing the makeup game. In her own evolution from a teenage mother putting herself through nursing school to socking away every spare dollar to start Beauty Bakerie, and recently garnering a $3 million seed investment from Unilever Ventures, Cashmere Nicole is redefining what a beauty mogul looks like. And while she\u2019s a self-confessed \u201cserial entrepreneur from the age of 12,\u201d she admits that she\u2019s learning as she grows her business:\n\nI think I am pretty tough, just based on feedback from some of the people around me, but sometimes I even question that. So, I think you have to have a delicate balance of knowing when to be sugar and when to be shit, a little. And I think I\u2019m still learning how to balance both of them; and [that\u2019s] the tough part about being a CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith pending expansion into retailers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Beauty Bakerie\u2019s growing international presence on home-shopping giant QVC, and a daughter heading off to college soon, it looks like Nicole\u2019s balancing act is going to get quite a workout. But she\u2019s more than up to the challenge:\n\nYou know, walking out of a doctor\u2019s office and being told you have cancer; you can cry, but what do you do? Go dig a grave for yourself and lay in it? I mean, you have to keep going; and that applies to everything. ... My best advice for staying power is that when the whole world and all of your friends might tell you that the easiest thing is to turn around and go back, you should do the exact opposite. You should keep going forward, because in that walk and in that journey of staying, you do become powerful, and you become stronger. And you will fall, and you will hurt yourself, and you will cry.

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["probably", "students", "day", "shit", "arming", "going", "student", "teachers", "school", "policy", "class", "worst", "suggestions", "chris", "teacher"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

Cue the chorus of \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman.\u201d\n\nI met Napier three years ago, when she approached me on the street outside the Makeup Show in New York City. I thought she was going to ask me for modeling tips, but it was she who schooled me in the \u201cthe beauty of taking it all off.\u201d She placed a simple, black foil packet in my palm with her name written on it, smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m Lauren.

The impression she left stayed with me\u2014I knew she\u2019d be one to watch.\n\nI tossed the packet into my bag and retrieved it a few days later, to remove heavy on-camera makeup.

Napier suddenly saw a white space in the crowded and competitive luxury-cosmetics market. \u201cWomen spend a lot of time and effort on prestige makeup, and you want the same quality of experience when you\u2019re taking your makeup off, as well,\u201d she says.\n\nNapier called it. The market was ready for her product.\n\nAlong with entrepreneurship, glamour is in Napier\u2019s blood. Growing up between Las Vegas and Texas, Napier drew equal inspiration from the showgirls on the Vegas Strip and Ann Richards, then the governor of Texas. \u201cShe had that Southern-belle charm. Southern gusto. You always knew who she was,\u201d Napier says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a go-getter who gets it done her way is in her blood, too. It\u2019s a spirit that informs everything behind her brand.\n\n\u201cI felt like if I was going to put my name on a product, it had to have the same kind of integrity that I carry myself with in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially in these times, it\u2019s important that underserved communities are being employed. I was heavily influenced by Obama\u2019s administration to make a positive impact, socially and environmentally.\u201d\n\nPutting that influence into action, Napier uses solar-powered manufacturing facilities owned by a Chinese-American female immigrant. During our interview, Napier is speaking from the floor of the co-packing company she uses, specifically chosen because it employs \u201chandi-capable\u201d workers, who are either mentally or physically impaired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose are two communities who are often overlooked or underserved, and I wanted to make sure they were included,\u201d she says. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to be a huge brand one day. Doing good is a big part of my story.\u201d\n\nNapier\u2019s ideas and inspiration weren\u2019t backed up by formal business training or an angel investor. In fact, her dream literally almost went up in smoke before she even began.\n\nKnowing that she wanted to create some kind of beauty business, Napier had adhered to a strict financial plan to clean up her credit from college loans. And then, close to meeting her startup goal, her house burned down\u2014and her insurance company refused her a payout. Recovery took another seven years, and finally saving $4,000, which she combined with a tax refund and an American Express card that \u201cmade things happen a lot faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNapier says, \u201cI never let the fact that I have no formal business education scare me.\u201d Her antidote to fear? \u201cPick up the phone and ask questions. I don\u2019t fear rejection.\u201d\n\nIt shows: Napier does all her own marketing and press, landing herself in both the storied pages of Vogue and the hallowed halls of Net-a-Porter, which she initially tagged on Instagram. \u201cI just had to be there,\u201d she says. Then comes a somewhat stunning revelation from a woman who seems\u2014well, so naturally perfect:\n\n\u201cBeing bullied made me fearless,\u201d she shares. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. I always encourage people who are going through it to look inside and find themselves. I\u2019m the same person now; I just look different.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer voice becomes supercharged with a kind of elegant authority: \u201cAnd one day, I won\u2019t look like this, either; but I\u2019ll still have the same wisdom and personality.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for Lauren Napier? \u201c J. Crew just put me in the store for their holiday beauty collection,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m right at the register.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Napier\u2019s capable hands, the business built on taking it all off is definitely taking off:\n\n\u201cBeing in business is like wearing a heart monitor: You\u2019re up, and then your down.

McClatchy High School\u2019s fourth annual science fair featured a project entitled \u201cRace and IQ.\u201d The student who designed the project, described as a boy of Asian descent, is a participant in the accelerated Humanities and International Studies Program, or HISP, which was created to promote cultural awareness and sensitivity.\n\nThe project featured excerpts from five texts, including The Essential Kafir, a book published in 1904 that supported apartheid by arguing that black South Africans were intellectually inferior to whites. The related term \u201cKaffir\u201d has long been derided as the South African equivalent of the n-word.\n\nThe student asked a handful of his fellow students to take an online intelligence quiz and used his results to justify why there were so few blacks and Hispanics in the HISP program. The school district says that the program currently has 508 students enrolled, including 12 African Americans, 80 Hispanics and 104 Asian Americans. The student researcher concluded:\n\n[T]he lower average IQs of blacks, Southeast Asians, and nonwhite Hispanics means that they are not as likely as non-Hispanic whites and Northeast Asians to be accepted into a more academically rigorous program such as HISP. Therefore, the racial disproportionality of HISP is justified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConnecting race and IQ through science has a long history that stretches back to the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which used eugenics to turn the \u201cone-drop rule\u201d into law. More recently, white supremacists have used Charles Murray\u2019s scientifically discredited The Bell Curve to justify a relatively unknown movement called the \u201calt-right.\u201d You\u2019ve probably never heard of it, but trust me, it\u2019s going to be huge.\n\nTo understand this phenomenon, one must understand that the \u201cintelligence quotient\u201d does not measure smarts. It measures a certain kind of intelligence. Ironically, the creator of the scale that is most used to measure intelligence, Alfred Binet, believed that these tests were an inadequate way to measure intelligence because they don\u2019t factor in emotional intelligence or creativity.\n\nScientists know that the results of these tests are skewed in favor of certain socioeconomic groups and have nothing to do with genetics. For instance, studies show that kids adopted by rich parents score 15 points higher on IQ tests, and family income is one of the more accurate predictors of SAT scores, a test that was created to exclude certain minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to be clear that at McClatchy High School we promote and embrace an inclusive environment and way of thinking which excludes any form of discrimination,\u201d wrote Peter Lambert, principal of McClatchy High, in an email to parents. \u201cMany of you have asked me what our school is doing in response to this incident. I want you to know we are taking this incident very seriously and we will be reviewing the incident and implementing all measures as appropriate to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo be clear, the idea that race is connected to intelligence is not a fringe idea. More than a decade ago, another California high school student wrote that a number of his classmates \u201clacked basic English skills\u201d and there were \u201cvery few, if any,\u201d Hispanic students in his honors classes, \u201cdespite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat student eventually graduated and went on to become a prominent figure who helped craft the current presidential administration\u2019s travel ban and immigration policy and is credited with creating Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d slogan.

This, despite her appearance as Lourdes \u201cLuLu\u201d Blackmon in Netflix\u2019s recent series reboot of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It; a scene-stealing supporting role that has literally sent Hollywood calling (as evidenced by the feature-film audition she\u2019d sent off just prior to our conversation).\n\nPersonally asked to audition by Lee himself after attending an open studio event at 40 Acres and a Mule, Benitez took a chance and went for it, attending a series of castings and screen tests before landing the role of Lourdes, Mars Blackmon\u2019s Santeria-practicing sister. (Fun fact: Hamilton alum Anthony Ramos was the first cast, as a now Puerto Rican Mars.) On-screen, Benitez was a natural, radiating equal parts high-strung Brooklyn Boricua and shamanic grace in her acting debut.\n\nBut Benitez\u2019s first on-screen experience was a bit more spontaneous as she juggled both a blind date and a mystery basket on Food Network\u2019s hit show Chopped\u2014and walked away with the win.\n\nThe chef\u2014who holds diplomas in both culinary and culinary management from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York City\u2014initially found her calling while stationed in Germany with the Air Force, having also grown up an Air Force \u201cbrat,\u201d born in England and raised in California, Panama, Texas, Turkey and Washington, D.C., before starting her own military career.\n\nAnd, like the military, cooking is in her blood:\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve always been into cooking; my mom\u2019s a bomb cook, her mother is ... food has always been a big part of my life. But moving [to Germany] and living 30 minutes from the French border, going to get wine and cheese and all kinds of foods from different markets, that made me think about food in a more gourmet sense. ... I grew up always eating really good food, but living there put me in the mind frame of elevated food: the presentation, the markets and the whole culture around food there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, she\u2019d intended to channel that passion into food writing, starting a Tumblr in 2010 called I\u2019ll Cook Like Your Mother, the title inspired by a Badu lyric. Today, I\u2019ll Cook Like Your Mother is a full-fledged business and blog, offering catering, events and culinary education from Chef Santana herself. A scroll through her food gallery is a seriously sensual experience; and while Benitez is well-versed in a variety of cuisines, when asked for her favorite, her response was just as sexy: \u201cI really like Asian flavors\u2014I like the umami: that tart, that sweet, that spicy that Asian food brings.\u201d\n\nOn the day of our interview, Benitez stuffed 200 empanadas for a nonprofit organization empowering women, a service she happily renders whenever a cause resonates with her. But left to her own devices\u2014or in collaboration with fellow chef and friend Jade Verette as newly minted culinary team For the Culture Catering\u2014she likes \u201clots of colors, lots of flavor, and just, you know ... fun shit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer heritage is equally colorful, as the third of four daughters of a black-and-Italian mother and Puerto Rican father raised in nearby St. Croix. For her, it\u2019s a type of mixed heritage that too often goes ignored:\n\nWhen people think of \u2018mixed\u2019 [people], a lot of times, their heads just go to half-white, half-black. As a mixed woman, I don\u2019t relate to [that], because my family\u2014on both sides\u2014are black ... and it\u2019s like, the culture is different, but the same. I don\u2019t have a \u2018white side\u2019 of my family; it\u2019s just different brands of black, on both sides.\n\nWhen she is asked what her \u201cblack on both sides\u201d holiday will look like this year, Benitez\u2019s answer is delicious: \u201cIt looks like a lot of coquito, pastelillos, roast pernil [pork shoulder], arroz con gandules, prime rib, ham, greens, mac and cheese. ... It\u2019s all just one big, beautiful mesh of good-ass food.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHell, yeah.

She\u2019s a woman who would know, given her degree from Harvard in ninth- to 14th-century Arabic literature and diplomacy. For nine years, Akkad has held the position of senior vice president of local and cultural innovation at Est\u00e9e Lauder, overseeing multiethnic innovation for some 25 brands under the Lauder umbrella, including La Mer, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. But Akkad\u2019s journey to the top of the beauty business had an unlikely beginning: It began at age 19, when she went off to do a semester abroad at the American University in Cairo in 1984.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous, sunny afternoon in New York City, and Akkad and I are having lunch at Freds in Barneys New York on Madison Avenue, where fashion folk gather to see and be seen. Over salads and crab cakes (we split the fries), Akkad recounts her student days in Egypt.\n\n\u201cEgypt wasn\u2019t conservative at all at that time; women were in Western dress, and the caf\u00e9 at the American University was the big expat hangout for students and diplomatic hopefuls like myself,\u201d she says, adding a caveat that adds significant intrigue. \u201cEvery spy in the world was crawling the campus and lounging in the caf\u00e9 looking for recruits.\u201d\n\nThe American University Caf\u00e9 was also where Susan spied the love of her life: fellow student and theater major Ahmed Akkad. The two have now been married for over 30 years.\n\nEgypt is also where she began what would become a lifelong love affair with beauty and fragrance. In the age of the pharaohs, men and women alike wore statement eyeliner and fabulous wigs; to this day, fragrance in Egypt remains a daily multilayered ritual where everything from hair to furniture is perfumed like the wearer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrushing aside dreams of a diplomatic career, Susan relocated with her new husband to New York, where they placed their priorities on making a living\u2014no obvious feat, with two very esoteric degrees (his is in comparative literature and theater). While Ahmed launched a fashion line, Susan found a job as assistant to the sportswear editor at American Vogue, which paid $15,000 a year in 1986. In need of more money, she quickly moved on to a (slightly) better-paying job as a public relations assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder. Starting salary? $16,000.\n\nLanding a job in beauty after dreams of a diplomatic career may seem odd, but in the buttoned-up multinational corporate world of luxury beauty, it was once de rigueur to hire the wives of State Department officials in public relations and similar roles in international business. Their experience organizing official dinners, navigating the social and international worlds, and connections to wealthy society made them the organic influencers of that time.\n\nAs an entry-level assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder, Susan was allowed the chance to watch and learn from all departments. She laughs as she recalls getting dry-cleaning and throwing birthday parties for a boss\u2019s cat as part of her duties. What she learned was what it takes to work every rung of the corporate ladder; but most important, she learned that she loved the beauty biz\u2014especially fragrance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ahmed\u2019s fashion line took off as a global luxury brand, Susan left the corporate world to work in her husband\u2019s company. In 1995, Ahmed sold the fashion brand to his manufacturers to start interiors, accessories and other businesses. Susan was now unemployed, and through some recommendations from friends, she found her way to Lanc\u00f4me as director of fragrance.\n\nSusan Akkad was soon recruited back to Est\u00e9e Lauder, where she served in various global marketing positions for almost 10 years before being installed in her current post as senior VP of local and cultural innovation, responsible for multiethnic innovation. What exactly does multicultural innovation entail? In this role, Akkad partners with the many brands under Est\u00e9e Lauder to advise on multicultural strategy and the best ways to tailor products and communication to be more meaningful to women of color.\n\nHer post at Lauder affords her a global view of the beauty of black and brown women, who, she tells me, are more confident about their looks than their white counterparts. As a culture, we black women historically have primarily based our self-esteem surrounding our looks on the opinions within our community, rather than on mainstream media standards. Akkad recounts being asked why certain products advertised as corrective were not appealing to black women. To which she would answer, that\u2019s because \u201cwhen you market a product to black women as if there is something wrong with them that needs fixing, black women simply don\u2019t relate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking me straight in the eye, Akkad lightly brushes back one of her naturally ink-black curls and straightens the peaked lapel of her black Junya Watanabe tuxedo suit.

Ayana Smith\u2019s goal with her new line of statement tees was not to make a statement at all but, rather, to issue a call to action, to incite and inspire conversation on topics that can be hard to talk about in mixed company.\n\nSpeaking of mixed company: that interracial dinner for 50 she was talking about? It happened\u2014debatably by design or accident\u2014when she volunteered her home to host whoever signed up through Day of Dinners, a national charity with partners as diverse as Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Black Lives Matter and the ACLU. The topic Smith chose for discussion was \u201cBridging the Gap Between East and West of the River.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith counts herself as not only a resident but also an advocate for education and economic development in D.C.\u2019s Ward 7. Smith\u2019s neighborhood, where she lives with her husband and two kids, is an area known for the highest levels of poverty and reported crime east of the Anacostia River. Even though the Smiths\u2019 Escape Lounge is located on a trendy street west of the river, Ayana Smith chose to open their home on the economically challenged East Side because she \u201cwanted to showcase all the good that\u2019s happening here east of the river.\u201d\n\nLooking back on the dinner and her chosen topic, Smith tells me, \u201cWe never even got to the topic.\u201d The people who showed up were predominantly white, and Smith says she was shocked by how much they cared and wanted to talk about issues that affect the black community. After that first gathering in July, she began having regular #AskMe group dinners to further the dialogue. The resulting conversations prompted the concept for the tees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe explains: \u201cHearing \u2018That\u2019s not a community you want to go into unless you\u2019re looking to get shot\u2019 is a [common warning] that white people in our #AskMe group encountered when they shared that they were coming to my home. We help each other understand ways to deal with and how to respond to questions about race that can be awkward to approach or difficult to answer.\u201d\n\n#AskMeTees was born out of that personal frustration; not only from assumptions made about her neighborhood but from other offenses\u2014like strangers walking up to her kids and touching their hair. As Smith recounts, \u201cMost other people are teaching their kids not to let strangers touch them, so why do you think it\u2019s OK to walk up and start touching my kids?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the impetus behind the \u201c#AskMe Why You Can\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d shirt. \u201cLiving while black\u201d was another motivator for launching this T-shirt line\u2014only 10 days old as of press time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t assume anything about me,\u201d Smith says. \u201cAsk me!\u201d\n\nFor instance, Smith hates rings and doesn\u2019t wear a wedding ring.

This was the first reunion of any sort\u2014high school or college\u2014that I had any interest in going to. And not because high school and/or college were particularly difficult times for me. I had as much fun in school as an introverted eggheaded nigga with the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League\u2019s best left-to-right leaning crossover could. I just didn\u2019t care enough to go. There\u2019s no strain of conversation that bores me more than school-specific nostalgia, and I had no interest in reliving or remembering the shit I did when Caribbean Rhythms still aired.\n\nThe 20th high school reunion, however, is the first major reunion where you\u2019re more than twice as old as you were when you graduated. Which applies a convincing veneer of importance, like \u201cHOLY SHIT I WAS 18 AND IT\u2019S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE I WAS 18 WHICH MEANS I\u2019VE LIVED LIKE A WHOLE NEW ENTIRE LIFE SINCE HIGH SCHOOL!\u201d And so, when I received a Facebook invite a few months ago, I began to look forward to attending. Just so I could scratch it off of the bucket list I\u2019d carry if I believed in carrying buckets or lists.\n\nAnd then, an hour into the reunion Saturday night, I began to wish I had stayed home and watched Shark Tank.\n\nTo be fair, the people who put the event together did a great job. There were free Reese\u2019s Cups. White women distributing plates of yellow cake. A DJ who, for the first couple hours of the night, played nothing but shit from the late \u201990s and early aughts. (I thought I\u2019d go my entire life without hearing Sunshine Anderson\u2019s \u201cHeard It All Before\u201d again. I was mistaken.) There were even reunion crashers\u2014people who graduated the year before or the year after who came either because all of their homies were there or because they were just really confused. But the act of reunioning itself just didn\u2019t move me much, for a number of reasons that I\u2019ll distill to four.\n\n1. Facebook has made reunions obsolete.\n\nThe old classmates you encounter at reunions are usually spilt into four groups:\n\nA) People you still keep in touch with\n\n\n\nB) People you don\u2019t keep in touch with, but you\u2019d still like to know how they\u2019re doing\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC) People you forgot even existed, and then you see them and say \u201cOh yeah. This person exists!\u201d\n\n\n\nD) People you gave no fucks about in high school and give even less fucks about now\n\n\n\nPerhaps reunions mattered more before the internet. Because aside from the people you talk to/see in person, you\u2019d just have less opportunity to keep tabs on your old classmates. But Facebook already allows you to stay connected with A and B. And if a person isn\u2019t an A or a B, there\u2019s really no reason to ever see them again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. It forces you to relive high school.\n\nEasily the most interesting part of the night was watching how people became their old selves when placed back into that 20-year-old environment and surrounded by the same people. Gregarious litigators and salesmen who were more introverted in high school became wallflowers again. The high school \u201cbad bitches\u201d who, well, may have seen better days were the center of attention again, while the late(r) bloomers went back to being the Michelle Williams to the bad bitches\u2019 Beyonc\u00e9s. The football players and the cheerleaders danced and took pictures together like they were at some sort of geriatric prom.\n\nI even succumbed to that, too. Twenty-four hours earlier, I was in New York City celebrating VSB\u2019s acquisition and new partnership and meeting with my book editor. But at the reunion, all anyone wanted to talk to me about was basketball. Probably because all I wanted to talk about was basketball. It was weird. I\u2019m weird.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. It makes you a liar.\n\nNumber of times I said or heard \u201cYo, we definitely need to get up next week or something!\u201d Approximately 20.\n\nNumber of people I actually plan to get up with this week? Maybe one.\n\n4. It\u2019s like going to a wax museum, except the wax figures can move and talk and take selfies and drink Fireball.\n\nThe surreality of seeing these facsimiles of people you remember as 18-year-olds but don\u2019t really remember remember 20 years later is jarring. Like, you know how it feels to watch one of those Legends games where your favorite former pros look somewhat the same and are out there \u201cplaying\u201d their sport but really just trying not to tear an achilles? Where the idea of the game is better than the game itself? Well, a 20-year reunion is like watching and playing in that game. But with no spectators.

While I\u2019m none too fond of female leaders being posited as the fallback plan for a dysfunctional patriarchy, rather than the highly qualified corrective measure, recent research\u2014including a Gallup poll\u2014seems to agree with our 44th president.\n\nAs reported by CNBC Make It., a recently updated 2012 study by leadership-development firm Zenger Folkman revealed that \u201cwomen scored higher than men in 13 out of the 16 leadership competencies Folkman\u2019s research measure for, tying only for their tendency to be innovative.\u201d\n\nAlso notable is that the study also considered women an \u201cuntapped resource,\u201d despite our prevalence in the workforce. Company president and psychometrician Joe Folkman explained that this could likely be an issue of confidence\u2014on the part of not just working women but also the companies that employ them.\n\n\u201cIn organizations where women don\u2019t feel like second-class citizens and they don\u2019t feel abused, they actually feel empowered. They feel like they\u2019re taken seriously and like they have a future there,\u201d Folkman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain: Ya think?\n\nWhile it\u2019s unknown whether the Zenger Folkman leadership research went further, polling the same categories along racial lines, it\u2019s worth considering that black women are currently the highest-educated group in the United States\u2014and are therefore presumably the most qualified for leadership positions. And yet a 2016 study produced by the American Association of University Women (pdf) indicates that black women occupy a mere 8 percent of private-sector jobs, and only 2 percent of leadership roles.\n\nSo while the leadership potential is there, it remains untapped.

There are many women and men like my mother with successful side hustles, who lack access to support networks, educational resources or capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThrough Rising Tide we offer programs such as our Community Business Academy, Business Acceleration Services, Credit to Capital and the Start Something Challenge to help people, like my mother, gain the tools they need to transform their side businesses into sustainable and profitable ventures,\u201d she says.\n\nSo why New Jersey?\n\n\u201cAlex is from New Jersey, and so, when we graduated from Harvard, we spent a lot of time there, getting to know Camden, Trenton, Newark and Jersey City. We realized we did not have to go far to help those in need. We also recognized that the entrepreneurial spirit in each community could answer the community\u2019s own needs, so we decided to start Rising Tide Capital in Jersey City.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo who does Rising Tide Capital work with?\n\n\u201cThe average RTC entrepreneur is a 40-year-old single mother of two children, earning less than $35,000 a year,\u201d she explains. \u201cNinety percent of our entrepreneurs are minorities and 70 percent are women. Eighty percent of RTC entrepreneurs are low- to moderate-income, and 27 percent are unemployed at intake.\u201d\n\nWith the help of philanthropists like multibillionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s son Peter, who is co-president of the NoVo Foundation, Demmellash plans to expand the program nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWithin the next five years, we see the build-out of our replication program and the emergence of a national community of Rising Tide Capital entrepreneurs,\u201d she says. \u201cAs Rising Tide Capital has grown, we\u2019ve had requests from many communities for our programs.

Rising Tide Capital exists to give underserved entrepreneurs the same access to financial and support networks\u2014to build those boats.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo participate in Rising Tide Capital\u2019s Community Business Academy, you must be over 18 years old with an idea or talent that you would like to grow into a viable business, and have some experience in the industry in which you want to grow your business.

Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Jackie a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u2018don\u2019t look good on you\u2019 or \u2018you can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u2019 I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u2018she doesn\u2019t work very hard, because she doesn\u2019t have to\u2019\u2014[it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Jackie is no stranger to hard work. She says \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, that want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she says. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say \u2018You\u2019re too pretty, how could you be in the army? Whatever that means\u201d\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Jackie seems to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable. \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s okay to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounts in her voice as she tells me she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative, we are multi-faceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable, people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She points to prejudices surrounding beauty like the now-defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive/unattractive a woman really is. Aina says:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Jackie has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Jackie also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d Aina explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not only just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African-American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level everyday\u2014that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina says:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel - if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier. When people see more than black they see mass market appeal, [and] are more willing to give you a chance. People look at me, and they only see Black. It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, Jackie actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Jackie has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but to learn what\u2019s on the market and get further inspiration on what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nIn February 2018, Jackie Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor. She tell us, \u201cYou know, I never thought that social change could come about through makeup.

Not only did Donald Trump become president, but he went about shoring up white supremacy as swiftly as possible.\n\nUnder his leadership, hate groups have grown and protections for marginalized people have been eagerly dismantled by the administration. And people of color, women and anyone who can be identified as \u201cother\u201d on a census form became even more obvious targets of overt prejudice, racist violence and blatant sexism.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. A February American Psychological Association poll found that 57 percent of Americans feel \u201csignificant stress\u201d thanks to today\u2019s political climate. We\u2019re also more anxious, more restless and extra sensitive in familiar surroundings. It\u2019s like we\u2019re drifting away on a wave of sadness.\n\nBut there might be an antidote to this languishing emotional recession.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that supporting and encouraging women of color to start their own businesses can give all of us a jolt of new energy and help us slow the descent into the psychological black hole that is the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay with me.\n\nWe need women of color to start their own businesses\u2014en masse\u2014for a few reasons. First, the rest of us can go work for them! (Explaining why that would be beneficial requires its own article.) The rest of us can support their creativity while experiencing what it\u2019s like to be valued and respected. We\u2019d also get a collective break from white supremacy at work (pun intended).\n\nAnd right now, we need a break.\n\nIn 2017 we\u2019re going to therapy more, with online therapy company TalkSpace reporting a jump in new patients this year, especially among people targeted by Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric. We\u2019re also self-medicating more, as evidenced by the spike in drinking among women of color and other groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s also face the fact that under Trump, women of color probably encounter even greater obstacles in getting promoted and earning what they\u2019re worth in traditional work environments. Trump governs by toxic masculinity and white supremacy. And he is taking a sledgehammer to opportunity and protective programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Title IX and Obama-era measures that would require companies to disclose how much they pay workers in order to address the gender pay gap.\n\nAccording to the research group Catalyst, women of color often lack the support (pdf) needed to move up the ranks in their workplace. They also face challenges for \u201csticking out\u201d and in trying to \u201cblend in.\u201d The report concluded that \u201c[b]ecause corporate environments typically do not reflect the behavioral norms common to the cultural backgrounds of women of color, these women may have to go to great lengths to adjust to the corporate environment and to network effectively.\u201d\n\nSo the rest of us have to step up and support women of color so that they can work in environments that utilize skills, perspectives and experiences that are not always fully expressed or nurtured in white-dominant workplaces. Two words: Ava DuVernay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe visionary filmmaker recently explained that instead of trying to break the glass ceiling, she is focused on \u201cbuilding my own house.\u201d\n\nWe need more Ava DuVernays. And Shonda Rhimeses. And Issa Raes. And Maria Hinojosas. But the rest of us have to put in work so that these gifted women among us can start their own enterprises\u2014to maximize and monetize their talents and possibilities\u2014and set the country on a better path as we prepare to become a majority-minority country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, women of color have already mastered so many of the requisite skills. From their work leading extended intergenerational families to organizing PTAs and church groups and running informal beauty and catering businesses from home, women of color have the human resources acumen to run successful enterprises and to empower employees to do their best work. They delegate, supervise and orchestrate major events like weddings, annual family gatherings, quincea\u00f1eras and large Greek-life gatherings.\n\nFrom these private and public experiences, women of color also emerge with a hard-won emotional intelligence, which a recent study shows is already more abundant in women. Experience shows that women of color have borne the burden of being de facto social workers, group therapists and conflict mitigators at work and school whenever racial tensions and intersectional misunderstandings flare up. The rest of us need to make sure they capitalize on those so-called soft skills.\n\nWe can start supporting women of color right now.\n\nPatronize their online stores and brick-and-mortar restaurants. Support their crowdfunding campaigns. Hire them for corporate projects. Donate to their nonprofits and join as volunteers. Buy their books, artwork and clothing lines. There are many opportunities in our daily lives to be intentional about finding and supporting a woman of color. We just have to seek them out.", "keywords": ["supremacy", "work", "white", "need", "rest", "support", "women", "presidency", "color", "running", "trump", "businesses", "start"], "polarity": 0.18249082141487202, "subjectivity": 0.4527170438562844},

The message and image caused both Harvard-Westlake campuses to shut down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast evening, we learned of an internet post that mentions Harvard-Westlake by name,\u201d the school said in a statement viewed by the New York Post. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, and because the safety of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority, we made the decision to close school today.

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

Howard, 19, originally of Keller, Texas, pleaded guilty Friday in a Twin Falls, Idaho, courtroom to injury to a child. According to the news site, Howard will likely be sentenced to two to three years of probation, which he may be able to complete in Texas. Prosecutors will reportedly recommend that Howard serve 300 hours of community service.\n\nStill, the 19-year-old will completely avoid prison or jail time for his part in the brutal October 2015 attack of a black, mentally disabled teammate after a football practice at Dietrich High School. According to the Times-News, he may even ultimately be able to have his conviction dismissed if he completes his probation without any issues and without committing any more crimes.\n\nAccording to the Times-News, as part of the deal, Howard submitted an Alford plea, which allowed him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that prosecutors would most likely have won a conviction if the case had gone to trial. A judge will only order prison time if Howard violates his probation. The maximum punishment that could be meted out in such a case would be 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Casey Hemmer acknowledged during the hearing that Howard's actions were \"egregious\" and caused the victim \"a lot of suffering,\" but then went on to say that it was not a sex crime and that that was why the attorney general's office reduced charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for Mr. Howard to suffer the consequences of a sex offender,\u201d Hemmer said. \u201cBut he still needs to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nHemmer agreed with Howard's attorneys' claim that the \"victim was not at any time pinned down, raped or pinned down and subjected to any sort of forcible penetration,\" citing evidence.\n\nWhen asked by the judge whether prosecutors intended to argue that the attack was racially motivated, Hemmer said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour honor, based on what we\u2019ve had, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say that there are things that we found going around that school and that locker room involving a lot of the parties here that had racial undertones. But it\u2019s not our belief that this was a racially motivated crime. This was more of a vulnerable-victim-motivated crime. I think it probably would have happened to anybody that was in the same kind of circumstances and mental state as the victim here.\u201d\n\nAs the Times-News notes, despite the court rulings, a $10 million civil lawsuit filed by the victim is being processed through U.S. District Court. The lawsuit charges that the attack on the victim was a culmination of months of \"severe and pervasive harassment, racial discrimination, mental and physical assault and battery,\" of which the district, school administrators and football coaches were all aware or should have been aware.\n\nHoward is not a defendant in the lawsuit, but the document did describe him as \"as a large and aggressive male who had been sent to live with his relatives in Idaho due to his inability to keep out of trouble in Texas.\" The suit accused him of bringing \"with him from Texas a culture of racial hatred toward\" the victim, adding that his bullying was ignored by administration and coaches \"at least in part due to his athletic ability and community connections.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, the suit claims that Howard humped the victim while taunting him during football practices. The 19-year-old allegedly forced the victim to learn a Ku Klux Klan song and knocked him unconscious during football camp while other teammates and coaches cheered and called the victim racist names such as \"Kool-Aid, chicken-eater, watermelon and [n\u2014ger].\"\n\nSentencing is scheduled for Feb. 24.\n\nRead more at the Times-News.\n\n", "keywords": ["high", "disabled", "white", "player", "crime", "howard", "prosecutors", "teammate", "sex", "idaho", "jail", "timesnews", "rape", "football", "victim", "texas", "attack", "school"], "polarity": 0.01846237551155584, "subjectivity": 0.42315638823835544},

Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Jackie a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u2018don\u2019t look good on you\u2019 or \u2018you can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u2019 I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u2018she doesn\u2019t work very hard, because she doesn\u2019t have to\u2019\u2014[it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Jackie is no stranger to hard work. She says \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, that want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she says. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say \u2018You\u2019re too pretty, how could you be in the army? Whatever that means\u201d\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Jackie seems to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable. \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s okay to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounts in her voice as she tells me she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative, we are multi-faceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable, people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She points to prejudices surrounding beauty like the now-defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive/unattractive a woman really is. Aina says:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Jackie has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Jackie also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d Aina explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not only just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African-American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough.

It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, Jackie actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Jackie has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but to learn what\u2019s on the market and get further inspiration on what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nIn February 2018, Jackie Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor.

While it\u2019s great to have discussions on how important the film is to the African Diaspora and even the film industry, it can be just as important and fun to talk about certain aspects of it that shed light on how careful and successful director Ryan Coogler was in communicating the many messages that he used Black Panther to deliver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I enjoy talking about film, and in particular this one, so much, I invited my friend and fellow writer Clarkisha Kent to chat with me about Black Panther and its characters. Below is part of our discussion, which I hope you will enjoy and use it to generate more dialogue with other fans.\n\nCarolyn Hinds: For me the duality within Black Panther is first noticeable with M\u2019Baku and Erik. In the beginning of the film, we\u2019re shown M\u2019Baku\u2019s Jabari ancestors walking away from the other Wakandan tribes because the Jabari were afraid of where technology would take Wakanda, whereas Erik came to Wakanda not only for revenge against T\u2019Challa but to use his country\u2019s tech against him and the rest of the world and create what he calls an \u201cempire\u201d (boy, please).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkisha Kent: But, unlike his ancestors, M\u2019Baku isn\u2019t strictly against the use of technology\u2014he\u2019s just wary of it taking precedence over tradition. And fears that if that were to happen, Wakanda and her people would lose their way.\n\nCH: During the challenge ceremony, M\u2019Baku chastises Shuri (because what he sees as a child who is in charge of all the tech in Wakanda and thereby the future of Wakanda) for showing disregard for traditions that T\u2019Challa himself is taking part in. What I also appreciated about that scene was when T\u2019Challa told M\u2019Baku to yield, he did because he realized that his people still needed his leadership.\n\nNow, what Ryan Coogler did so brilliantly with the challenge scene is that at the climax of the film, T\u2019Challa and Killmonger are practically in the same situation, but instead of yielding Killmonger chooses death later on over instead of yielding to T\u2019Challa. When he said that he\u2019d rather be thrown into the sea instead of being in bondage, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut and started to cry because that imagery and history is so real to me that I didn\u2019t pick up on his other reason. Over time, I came to realize that in his mind, Killmonger would rather be dead than owe T\u2019Challa anything\u2014including a life. He chose death over possibly being locked up for what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: This shows that while M\u2019Baku and Killmonger provide very useful foils to T\u2019Challa, M\u2019Baku is willing to put pride aside in regards to T\u2019Challa for the greater good of Wakanda. This is not the case for Killmonger, who shows more and more throughout the movie that not only does he not care for Wakanda and sees it as a means to an end, but he is only in it for himself. Killmonger allegedly operates under the guise of liberation for what audiences assume to be black people all around the world, but we figure out right away that he\u2019s really not for the people when he burns the fricking mystical herb.\n\nEven with their tech, Wakanda is still very in tune with the traditional, the mystical and their ancestors in particular. What he did hurt me because it reminded me of Legend of Korra, where the Avatar at the time (Korra) screws up the whole cycle to where she severs the connection between her and the past Avatars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn burning the heart-shaped herb, Erik does a few things that establish who he really is as a person and what his true motives are: 1) It lets you know right away that he doesn\u2019t respect Wakanda or any of its traditions; 2) It shows us that what M\u2019Baku and his elders feared would happen did, that in a sense the connection to the ancestors would be lost; and 3) By doing what he did, Erik also showed that he doesn\u2019t even care about his own future and lineage.\n\nCH: Yes, it makes you question what kind of leader would someone like Erik be when he has no clear goal for his own personal future? How is he going to create an empire when revenge against T\u2019Challa (for something that had absolutely nothing to do with, by the way) him is all that Erik cares about? While the heart-shaped herb gives powers to whoever takes it, I also see it as a literal symbol for their lineage. As we have family trees\u2014Wakandans have the heart-shaped herb, each bloom representing a branch in the royal family. By burning it, Erik is literally saying that \u201cthe family line ends with me; I\u2019m the last.\u201d\n\nHis actions also show that Erik isn\u2019t thinking about the future of Wakanda; he was essentially saying that Wakanda as it was would end with him and when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an empire,\u201d I was thinking, \u201cIn order to have an empire you have to be thinking about the future.\u201d As the old saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t understand your future unless you understand your past.\u201d Erik didn\u2019t want to understand or respect Wankanda\u2019s past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the differences of M\u2019Baku and Killmonger, there is a similar duality that occurs between Nakia and Okoye. In my opinion Nakia is the better version of Erik in that she advocates for using Wakanda\u2019s tech and capabilities to help the world and those who have been disenfranchised. On the other hand, Okoye, like M\u2019Baku, is about tradition. She\u2019s for respecting and defending the throne with the Dora Milaje.\n\nCK: I\u2019m just fascinated with them because they mirror each other. For Okoye, her love manifests as what she considers to be her duty; to paraphrase her: \u201cI am loyal to the throne, loyal to the country and give my service to the throne no matter what.\u201d You can put a cactus on the throne, and Okoye would yield to the cactus [for] this reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Now, I had to question what Okoye said. How can you swear fealty to someone just because they\u2019re sitting in a chair, especially when it\u2019s obvious they are possibly unhinged? Yes, the throne is important, but it\u2019s what it symbolizes that really matters.\n\nThis particular plot point reminded me of Donald Trump, and as I sat there in the cinema, all I could think was, \u201cDon\u2019t be like the GOP, Okoye.\u201d You have to see the person you\u2019re serving for what they really are, especially when they\u2019re not fit for the position, and thankfully she saw Killmonger for what he was in the end.\n\nFor Nakia, her love manifests in helping everyone. Whereas to me the Dora Milaje is about helping one, while Nakia\u2019s personal philosophy is \u201cone for all,\u201d and the perfect example of this was shown in our introduction to Nakia. In showing her helping young girls who were held hostage in a caravan by men (who I believe were representative of Boko Haram), we learn that she will put her own life on the line to help others who are in danger, even if they\u2019re not Wakandan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a line that Okoye says after T\u2019Challa \u201cdies,\u201d that her \u201cduty is to serve Wakanda,\u201d and Nakia said her \u201cduty is to save Wakanda,\u201d and I said, \u201cLadies, it is literally one and the same.\u201d But to Okoye and Nakia, they saw saving and serving at two separate actions.\n\nCK: This comes to a head when Okoye sees T\u2019Challa is still alive later in the film and she thinks that that is enough that for everyone to realize the challenge is not over and that everyone would yield to that tradition. But when Erik basically says that he ain\u2019t \u2019bout that challenge life, she sees that tradition isn\u2019t going to be enough in this situation to fix it because this fool doesn\u2019t care about tradition. And she then decides that \u201cI\u2019m gonna save my country, too.\u201d\n\nWith all of the talk about claiming and protecting thrones, I drew parallels to Game of Thrones. People who love Game of Thrones will make the connection between the dilemma that Jamie faced when the Mad King was on the throne. It\u2019s one of these things where technically, as the king\u2019s guard, he should\u2019ve been 100 percent down with the Mad King no matter what, but after seeing all that the Mad King was doing, he just said, \u201cFuck it, you\u2019re corrup,t so you gotta die.\u201d So with that in mind, I wondered what would\u2019ve happened in the middle of the movie if Okoye just said \u201cfuck it\u201d as well prior to finding out T\u2019Challa was alive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Following on the GoT reference. Killmonger reminds me of Cerci; they both want the throne but actually know nothing about ruling. Cerci has proven on multiple occasions that she\u2019s not fit to rule, doesn\u2019t respect the position and also doesn\u2019t engender respect from others.\n\nCK: Cerci literally blamed the Dothraki for the lack of food her people had, and I wanted to know how they were even connected and what do they have to do with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Essentially, she pulled a Donald Trump\u2014blame everybody but yourself, which is again like Killmonger, and that\u2019s one of my biggest issues with him. Killmonger wants to rule, he \u201cwants it all,\u201d but my question was: What\u2019s his endgame? How are you going to improve the economy? Once the wars he helps to start are over, people will be starving and will need aid? What is his plan to provide food?\n\nHe says he wants to liberate, which is what people are getting all caught up in, but you can\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d unless you have a plan of what your end goal for liberation is. There\u2019s a line from a Bob Marley song that goes, \u201cRelease yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds,\u201d and to me, Erik has himself so enslaved mentally with the idea of revenge that he can\u2019t see past it.\n\nOn the contrary, with T\u2019Challa, I\u2019ve been seeing people say in tweets that he discredited what Nakia was saying, but then listened to what Killmonger said. But that\u2019s simply not true. The way I see it, T\u2019Challa understood what Nakia was saying, but initially he just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to deal with what she was asking. I\u2019m not sure how often T\u2019Challa leaves Wakanda, but in the MCU, the first time we see him outside Wakanda, T\u2019Chaka dies, and when Nakia is telling him that the world needs help, T\u2019Challa is still grieving for his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: Wakanda has been so insular for so long, and the moment that his father tries to get involved in the outside world, he dies. I can understand why T\u2019Challa is like, \u201cYou know what? The ancestors had the right idea all along. Maybe there are benefits to staying isolated.\u201d He then goes from burying his father to dealing with the whole Klaue situation, so he hasn\u2019t had time to breathe. Give the man a break. He\u2019s been through a lot, and it\u2019s why his anger at T\u2019Chaka is so palpable.\n\nPhoto: Marvel\n\nCH: That\u2019s why I love what Rachel Morrison did with the visuals, because she translated T\u2019Challa\u2019s emotions beautifully. When T\u2019Challa first sees his father in the ancestral plane, everything is all hazy and dreamlike, with the shades of blues and purples, the colors synonymous with Black Panther. But then when T\u2019Challa becomes disillusioned with the mythology of the former panthers, he took off his purple-tinted glasses\u2014so to speak\u2014and sees his ancestors for what they were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you notice in that scene, they\u2019re in their human forms, and this took place during the daytime, so he finally sees them for who they were and not mythological panthers, as in the first scene. I have to give credit to Rachel for that because it was subtle, but very powerful. The way I see it, what was done in the night was revealed in the light. T\u2019Challa no longer saw them as being on a pedestal; they were level and on the same ground as him.\n\nCK: And perhaps, those ancestral scenes in themselves function as the perfect extended allegory for the film. With all the dichotomies at play in the film, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in hidden and/or deeper meanings. But in the end, this film at every level functions as an example that there is always going to be a different way of looking at things or a different way of doing things. And oftentimes, things that we may see as oppositional may, in fact, be two sides of the same coin. Of course, this would mean that both Black Panther, life and blackness at large is layered and ultimately complex.

Turns out it\u2019s not as hard to make a woman happy as you might think\u2014we want more beauty in our lives! (And cash, but that\u2019s another story.) From twinkling eye shadows to top facial treatments, here are my top five recommended treats that will make someone you love feel like a star when she finds them under the tree!\n\n1. Eye Shadow Palettes\n\nWhen it comes to dazzling color that\u2019s easy to wear for the holiday season, the eyes have it. Personally, I love long-wearing shades and a lot of variety\u2014it adds up to a lot of options at a nice price. This is a cute video on how to use one of my favorite palettes from ColourPop, available for $30.\n\n2. Serum\n\nEveryone loves a serum\u2014or they should\u2014because those precious elixirs slide into your skin\u2019s thirsty pores like a saving grace. In fact, if you haven\u2019t already, try this beauty hack: Mix in a serum to customize any brand of liquid or cream foundation. Not only does it make controlling the application easier by blending together the foundation\u2019s suspension base of water, oil or silicone and pigment more throughly than just shaking the bottle, but it also turns your makeup into a treatment for your face.\n\nMy latest fave is SkinCeuticals B5 Serum ($82). Oil-free formulas are your best bet when it comes to making sure your foundation doesn\u2019t jailbreak itself from the serum in a mere few hours, since oil-based and water-based products don\u2019t mix. You ever notice makeup that looks like it\u2019s separating or melting? That\u2019s why. This gel formula nourishes with hyaluronic acid, which is the body\u2019s natural defense against dehydration.\n\n3. Night Cream\n\nWhen I turn the lights out at night, I say, \u201cMake it rain!\u201d I\u2019m a believer in slathering on night cream and waking up looking like a daisy. Knowing what kind of skin you have\u2014oily, dry, normal or combo\u2014dictates what you need to feed your face. Dr. Shirley Madhere, a New York City-based holistic plastic surgeon, advises that nighttime is the \u201coptimal moment for the skin to regenerate.\u201d In her opinion, there are three primary modes of regeneration, and these are the corresponding ingredients that maximize results:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepair with antioxidants: I like Herbivore\u2019s Moon Fruit Superfruit Night Treatment ($58).\n\nProtect with refined essential oils, like those found in Acure Organics Seriously Glowing Facial Serum ($19.99).\n\nHydrate: Hyaluronic acid-based moisturizers work to rehydrate the skin on a cellular level, restoring plumpness and luminosity, like Tata Harper\u2019s Illuminating Moisturizer ($105). This organic product has diamond dust in it and can be mixed into foundation for more radiance, or layered on top for strobing. Or bring out the RiRi in you, and shine bright like a diamond even when you wear it to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Face Masks\n\nOnce a week, take it all off. Winter weather and holiday parties kill your skin. Between the layers of dry skin building up from freezing temperatures outside and dry heat inside and the harsh effects of holiday cocktails and lipid-zapping party food, your pores are like microscopic firehoses trying to shoot out toxins as fast as they can.\n\nBottoms up! Sheet masks are a great way to get your drink on for thirsty skin in need of tightening, plumping or hydrating. Dr. Jart\u2019s Rubber Mask series\u2014besides it\u2019s totally intriguing packaging\u2014is not as Westworld as it looks. The combination of slippery red algae and calcium is cold to the touch and feels super sleek and sexy on the skin. And at $12 per mask, there\u2019s something for everyone!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the very affordable Dr. Jart masks above, Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained dermatologist and plastic surgeon, shared her list of favorite masks: SK-II Facial Treatment masks ($95-$135) and Sisley Black Rose Mask ($89) are her top picks for hydration during long-haul flights, and Cle de Peau\u2019s Intensive Brightening Mask helps fight hyperpigmentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Facial Devices\n\nGet lifted! I can tell you firsthand that micro-current technology works to tighten and lift your skin. I\u2019ve paid fortunes for micro-current treatments at corner nail salons and five-star spas alike, because they work. When these handheld devices came to the market for home use four years ago, I was first in line, and I still use mine weekly to tighten and lift my face and neck and smooth my forehead.\n\nThe mild electric current that passes through the silver orbs, conducted though a layer of ultrasound jelly (or even aloe vera, if you\u2019re on a budget), is like an elliptical machine for facial muscles. The current can sting slightly\u2014especially where skin tends to be thinner around the brow bone and under the eyes, while there\u2019s almost no sensation on the cheeks, neck and jawline. But a little discomfort is worth it in the under-eye area, where micro-currents do wonders to get rid of dark circles and puffiness in minutes by increasing circulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe devices, which are cordless and FDA approved, range in price from to $20 to $200, meaning that everyone can afford to get in the game. (Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up Managing Editor Maiysha Kai swears by her NuFace Mini.)\n\nSo, I say plug and play this Christmas, and give your skin a bright and shiny New Year!", "keywords": ["skin", "christmas", "gift", "buy", "facial", "best", "masks", "lists", "mask", "night", "holiday", "dr", "treatment", "thats", "serum", "beauty"], "polarity": 0.22825216450216457, "subjectivity": 0.5446139971139972},

I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\u201d (video)\n\nTime to Recast World of Decision-Making Machines\n\nFirst, the futurist Amy Webb told the audience of journalists, librarians and foundation managers that they could easily be duped by the ever-growing purveyors of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImages of their faces could be affixed to others\u2019 bodies, their voices to impostors. Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks. Right?\u201d said the author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream: Forecast and Take Action on Tomorrow\u2019s Trends, Today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could spend an entire day showing you examples of all kinds of places in which machine-learning algorithms don\u2019t recognize darker faces, where if you . . . are a non-Native English speaker, it\u2019s difficult for you to be understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary data sets that was used to train a lot of the voice recognition systems came from Philadelphia from the 1990s; there was a series of I think 700 recoded phone calls. If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined. Based on a Knight Foundation survey of 20,000 respondents:\n\n\u201c45% see a great deal of bias in media coverage today, compared to 25% in 1989\n\n\u201c66% say media doesn\u2019t do a good job separating fact from opinion, compared to 58% who thought the media DID do a good job of that in 1984\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLess than half of Americans can name an objective news source\n\n\u201cAnd yet 84% see the media as key to our democracy\n\nPhoto: George Dalton Tolbert IV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe people are saying, \u2018News and information are important, but we don\u2019t think you are doing it well.\u2019 This is a place where I believe foundations of all sizes can make a difference. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAt one of the breakout sessions, \u201cCommunity-Focused Journalism: Inspiration and How-to for Funders,\u201d Paul Waters of the Democracy Fund and Molly de Agular of the News Integrity Initiative outlined the role foundations can play in shaping community conversations and how funders can influence news operations. No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues. Through collaboration, the journalists had more impact because they discovered new stories and reached new audiences. . . .\u201d\n\nJason Alcorn, MediaShift: Knight Media Forum Focuses on Non-Profit News, Impact and Danger of Algorithms\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranda Bogen, medium.com: Artificial intelligence will force us to confront our values (Sept. 22, 2016)\n\nEditorial, Hartford Courant: The State Of Journalism Today\n\nFuture Today Institute: 2018 Tech Trends For Journalism and Media\n\nLogan Koepke, medium.com: Pre-trial algorithms deserve a fresh look, study suggests (March 30, 2017)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Larson, Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., ProPublica: How Machines Learn to Be Racist (Oct. 19, 2016)\n\nSandi Miller, MIT News: Calculating the cost of tech-fueled discrimination (Dec. 13, 2017)\n\nAnna Orso, billypenn.com: Can Philly\u2019s new technology predict recidivism without being racist?

While it\u2019s great to have discussions on how important the film is to the African Diaspora and even the film industry, it can be just as important and fun to talk about certain aspects of it that shed light on how careful and successful director Ryan Coogler was in communicating the many messages that he used Black Panther to deliver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I enjoy talking about film, and in particular this one, so much, I invited my friend and fellow writer Clarkisha Kent to chat with me about Black Panther and its characters. Below is part of our discussion, which I hope you will enjoy and use it to generate more dialogue with other fans.\n\nCarolyn Hinds: For me the duality within Black Panther is first noticeable with M\u2019Baku and Erik. In the beginning of the film, we\u2019re shown M\u2019Baku\u2019s Jabari ancestors walking away from the other Wakandan tribes because the Jabari were afraid of where technology would take Wakanda, whereas Erik came to Wakanda not only for revenge against T\u2019Challa but to use his country\u2019s tech against him and the rest of the world and create what he calls an \u201cempire\u201d (boy, please).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkisha Kent: But, unlike his ancestors, M\u2019Baku isn\u2019t strictly against the use of technology\u2014he\u2019s just wary of it taking precedence over tradition. And fears that if that were to happen, Wakanda and her people would lose their way.\n\nCH: During the challenge ceremony, M\u2019Baku chastises Shuri (because what he sees as a child who is in charge of all the tech in Wakanda and thereby the future of Wakanda) for showing disregard for traditions that T\u2019Challa himself is taking part in. What I also appreciated about that scene was when T\u2019Challa told M\u2019Baku to yield, he did because he realized that his people still needed his leadership.\n\nNow, what Ryan Coogler did so brilliantly with the challenge scene is that at the climax of the film, T\u2019Challa and Killmonger are practically in the same situation, but instead of yielding Killmonger chooses death later on over instead of yielding to T\u2019Challa. When he said that he\u2019d rather be thrown into the sea instead of being in bondage, I felt like someone had punched me in the gut and started to cry because that imagery and history is so real to me that I didn\u2019t pick up on his other reason. Over time, I came to realize that in his mind, Killmonger would rather be dead than owe T\u2019Challa anything\u2014including a life. He chose death over possibly being locked up for what he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: This shows that while M\u2019Baku and Killmonger provide very useful foils to T\u2019Challa, M\u2019Baku is willing to put pride aside in regards to T\u2019Challa for the greater good of Wakanda. This is not the case for Killmonger, who shows more and more throughout the movie that not only does he not care for Wakanda and sees it as a means to an end, but he is only in it for himself. Killmonger allegedly operates under the guise of liberation for what audiences assume to be black people all around the world, but we figure out right away that he\u2019s really not for the people when he burns the fricking mystical herb.\n\nEven with their tech, Wakanda is still very in tune with the traditional, the mystical and their ancestors in particular. What he did hurt me because it reminded me of Legend of Korra, where the Avatar at the time (Korra) screws up the whole cycle to where she severs the connection between her and the past Avatars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn burning the heart-shaped herb, Erik does a few things that establish who he really is as a person and what his true motives are: 1) It lets you know right away that he doesn\u2019t respect Wakanda or any of its traditions; 2) It shows us that what M\u2019Baku and his elders feared would happen did, that in a sense the connection to the ancestors would be lost; and 3) By doing what he did, Erik also showed that he doesn\u2019t even care about his own future and lineage.\n\nCH: Yes, it makes you question what kind of leader would someone like Erik be when he has no clear goal for his own personal future? How is he going to create an empire when revenge against T\u2019Challa (for something that had absolutely nothing to do with, by the way) him is all that Erik cares about? While the heart-shaped herb gives powers to whoever takes it, I also see it as a literal symbol for their lineage. As we have family trees\u2014Wakandans have the heart-shaped herb, each bloom representing a branch in the royal family. By burning it, Erik is literally saying that \u201cthe family line ends with me; I\u2019m the last.\u201d\n\nHis actions also show that Erik isn\u2019t thinking about the future of Wakanda; he was essentially saying that Wakanda as it was would end with him and when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an empire,\u201d I was thinking, \u201cIn order to have an empire you have to be thinking about the future.\u201d As the old saying goes, \u201cYou can\u2019t understand your future unless you understand your past.\u201d Erik didn\u2019t want to understand or respect Wankanda\u2019s past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about the differences of M\u2019Baku and Killmonger, there is a similar duality that occurs between Nakia and Okoye. In my opinion Nakia is the better version of Erik in that she advocates for using Wakanda\u2019s tech and capabilities to help the world and those who have been disenfranchised. On the other hand, Okoye, like M\u2019Baku, is about tradition. She\u2019s for respecting and defending the throne with the Dora Milaje.\n\nCK: I\u2019m just fascinated with them because they mirror each other. For Okoye, her love manifests as what she considers to be her duty; to paraphrase her: \u201cI am loyal to the throne, loyal to the country and give my service to the throne no matter what.\u201d You can put a cactus on the throne, and Okoye would yield to the cactus [for] this reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Now, I had to question what Okoye said. How can you swear fealty to someone just because they\u2019re sitting in a chair, especially when it\u2019s obvious they are possibly unhinged? Yes, the throne is important, but it\u2019s what it symbolizes that really matters.\n\nThis particular plot point reminded me of Donald Trump, and as I sat there in the cinema, all I could think was, \u201cDon\u2019t be like the GOP, Okoye.\u201d You have to see the person you\u2019re serving for what they really are, especially when they\u2019re not fit for the position, and thankfully she saw Killmonger for what he was in the end.\n\nFor Nakia, her love manifests in helping everyone. Whereas to me the Dora Milaje is about helping one, while Nakia\u2019s personal philosophy is \u201cone for all,\u201d and the perfect example of this was shown in our introduction to Nakia. In showing her helping young girls who were held hostage in a caravan by men (who I believe were representative of Boko Haram), we learn that she will put her own life on the line to help others who are in danger, even if they\u2019re not Wakandan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a line that Okoye says after T\u2019Challa \u201cdies,\u201d that her \u201cduty is to serve Wakanda,\u201d and Nakia said her \u201cduty is to save Wakanda,\u201d and I said, \u201cLadies, it is literally one and the same.\u201d But to Okoye and Nakia, they saw saving and serving at two separate actions.\n\nCK: This comes to a head when Okoye sees T\u2019Challa is still alive later in the film and she thinks that that is enough that for everyone to realize the challenge is not over and that everyone would yield to that tradition. But when Erik basically says that he ain\u2019t \u2019bout that challenge life, she sees that tradition isn\u2019t going to be enough in this situation to fix it because this fool doesn\u2019t care about tradition. And she then decides that \u201cI\u2019m gonna save my country, too.\u201d\n\nWith all of the talk about claiming and protecting thrones, I drew parallels to Game of Thrones. People who love Game of Thrones will make the connection between the dilemma that Jamie faced when the Mad King was on the throne. It\u2019s one of these things where technically, as the king\u2019s guard, he should\u2019ve been 100 percent down with the Mad King no matter what, but after seeing all that the Mad King was doing, he just said, \u201cFuck it, you\u2019re corrup,t so you gotta die.\u201d So with that in mind, I wondered what would\u2019ve happened in the middle of the movie if Okoye just said \u201cfuck it\u201d as well prior to finding out T\u2019Challa was alive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Following on the GoT reference. Killmonger reminds me of Cerci; they both want the throne but actually know nothing about ruling. Cerci has proven on multiple occasions that she\u2019s not fit to rule, doesn\u2019t respect the position and also doesn\u2019t engender respect from others.\n\nCK: Cerci literally blamed the Dothraki for the lack of food her people had, and I wanted to know how they were even connected and what do they have to do with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCH: Essentially, she pulled a Donald Trump\u2014blame everybody but yourself, which is again like Killmonger, and that\u2019s one of my biggest issues with him. Killmonger wants to rule, he \u201cwants it all,\u201d but my question was: What\u2019s his endgame? How are you going to improve the economy? Once the wars he helps to start are over, people will be starving and will need aid? What is his plan to provide food?\n\nHe says he wants to liberate, which is what people are getting all caught up in, but you can\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d unless you have a plan of what your end goal for liberation is. There\u2019s a line from a Bob Marley song that goes, \u201cRelease yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds,\u201d and to me, Erik has himself so enslaved mentally with the idea of revenge that he can\u2019t see past it.\n\nOn the contrary, with T\u2019Challa, I\u2019ve been seeing people say in tweets that he discredited what Nakia was saying, but then listened to what Killmonger said. But that\u2019s simply not true. The way I see it, T\u2019Challa understood what Nakia was saying, but initially he just wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to deal with what she was asking. I\u2019m not sure how often T\u2019Challa leaves Wakanda, but in the MCU, the first time we see him outside Wakanda, T\u2019Chaka dies, and when Nakia is telling him that the world needs help, T\u2019Challa is still grieving for his father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCK: Wakanda has been so insular for so long, and the moment that his father tries to get involved in the outside world, he dies. I can understand why T\u2019Challa is like, \u201cYou know what? The ancestors had the right idea all along. Maybe there are benefits to staying isolated.\u201d He then goes from burying his father to dealing with the whole Klaue situation, so he hasn\u2019t had time to breathe. Give the man a break. He\u2019s been through a lot, and it\u2019s why his anger at T\u2019Chaka is so palpable.\n\nPhoto: Marvel\n\nCH: That\u2019s why I love what Rachel Morrison did with the visuals, because she translated T\u2019Challa\u2019s emotions beautifully. When T\u2019Challa first sees his father in the ancestral plane, everything is all hazy and dreamlike, with the shades of blues and purples, the colors synonymous with Black Panther. But then when T\u2019Challa becomes disillusioned with the mythology of the former panthers, he took off his purple-tinted glasses\u2014so to speak\u2014and sees his ancestors for what they were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you notice in that scene, they\u2019re in their human forms, and this took place during the daytime, so he finally sees them for who they were and not mythological panthers, as in the first scene. I have to give credit to Rachel for that because it was subtle, but very powerful. The way I see it, what was done in the night was revealed in the light. T\u2019Challa no longer saw them as being on a pedestal; they were level and on the same ground as him.\n\nCK: And perhaps, those ancestral scenes in themselves function as the perfect extended allegory for the film. With all the dichotomies at play in the film, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in hidden and/or deeper meanings. But in the end, this film at every level functions as an example that there is always going to be a different way of looking at things or a different way of doing things. And oftentimes, things that we may see as oppositional may, in fact, be two sides of the same coin. Of course, this would mean that both Black Panther, life and blackness at large is layered and ultimately complex. And what is blackness if not complex?", "keywords": ["killmonger", "erik", "throne", "film", "wakanda", "panther", "okoye", "double", "black", "tchalla", "nakia", "consciousness", "mbaku", "duality"], "polarity": 0.08965443121693119, "subjectivity": 0.46354048563869993},

Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club. Judging by Eve\u2019s look on Sunday night, Christine is the pretty-curl expert.", "keywords": ["glow", "gorgeous", "wanted", "eves", "look", "grammys", "eve", "goods", "deep", "star", "weve", "used", "christine", "working"], "polarity": 0.24634356528887766, "subjectivity": 0.5758182139041513},
{"url": "https://io9.gizmodo.com/black-women-are-black-panthers-mightiest-heroes-1823205912", "title": "/black-women-are-black-panthers-mightiest-heroes-", "text": "Photo: Marvel\n\nAs more and more of the public flocks to theaters to catch a Black Panther screening, much of the conversation\u2019s been dedicated to comparing and contrasting T\u2019Challa and Killmonger\u2019s opposing views on the role Wakanda should be playing\u2014and should have played\u2014outside of its borders. But the reality is that Black Panther\u2019s female characters are engaged in a much more nuanced, and ultimately more interesting, dialogue about the film\u2019s ideas.\n\nThough he\u2019s the film\u2019s titular hero, T\u2019Challa is, in a lot of ways, kind of a cipher for the audience throughout most of the film. We\u2019re introduced to Wakanda through his eyes at a point in his life where he\u2019s unsure of exactly who he is, both as a hero and as a king; these are pieces of his identity that he looks to the women closest to him to help him work through and understand. In that very first scene where we meet Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), T\u2019Challa\u2019s quite literally gone out of his way to interrupt her mission abroad specifically because he needs her support in the wake of his father\u2019s recent death and his impending coronation.\n\nWhile Nakia and T\u2019Challa\u2019s romantic past undoubtedly factors into why he seeks her out, it\u2019s important to read somewhat deeper into T\u2019Challa\u2019s impulse to immediately reach out to Nakia, given her ideas about what role Wakanda plays in the world in the wake of T\u2019Chaka\u2019s death.\n\nUnlike Killmonger, who comes to argue in favor of a radical, expansionist Wakanda that subjugates the rest of the world for its own good and as a kind of payback for centuries of black disenfranchisement, Nakia champions a more complicated and humanitarian sort of diplomacy. It\u2019s telling that Nakia is the person we see T\u2019Challa conferring with at such a pivotal moment in Wakanda\u2019s political history, because by the end of the film, it\u2019s her perspective that T\u2019Challa chooses to see things from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, because T\u2019Challa is something of a cipher, he doesn\u2019t exactly spend much of the film trying to argue against Nakia. Rather, he listens to what she has to say, takes her words to heart, and asks that she stay close to him as they embark on Black Panther\u2019s larger epic adventures around the globe. Here, it\u2019s T\u2019Challa\u2019s respect for Nakia (and all of the women around him) that makes him strong and introduces us to the chorus of powerful voices that do, in their way, clash with Nakia\u2019s.\n\nThe ideological gap between Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the general of the royal bodyguard/special forces unit the Dora Milaje, is without a doubt the source of Black Panther\u2019s most narratively-fascinating and well-thought-out debate. In them, we see the merits of both sides of the argument about whether Wakanda should reveal itself to the world. Nakia, who spends time out in the larger world because of her duties as a Wakandan spy, intimately understands the potential her nation has to become a transformative agent of empowerment and liberation for countries in need. Okoye (and to a lesser extent Queen Mother Ramonda, played by Angela Bassett) is the staunchest of traditionalists whose beliefs represent the reality that Wakanda\u2019s might is the direct result of their isolationism. Where Killmonger sees Wakanda as having committed an unforgivable sin by closing itself off from the world, Okoye understands the fundamental necessity of the country\u2019s secrecy.\n\nThough it\u2019s easy to argue that Wakanda could and should have intervened in the world\u2019s affairs long before the events of Black Panther, the difficult truth of the matter is that Wakanda was not always and perhaps still isn\u2019t entirely invulnerable. There\u2019s no way of knowing at which point in history Wakanda leapfrogged the rest of the world in terms of technology, or when it could have safely revealed itself and potentially gone to war with other nations. The ancient vibranium pickaxe Klaue and Killmonger steal from the fictional British museum is invaluable, but it\u2019s a snapshot of where Wakanda was at the time. The weapon was undoubtedly formidable, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Wakanda was in a position to wage open war with the world with any hope of emerging as the victor. In shrouding itself in secrecy, Wakanda was able to become the formidable force we know it to be, and Okoye keenly understands that. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that that stance is the morally right one\u2014and we see Okoye coming to grips with the difficulty of that truth when she\u2019s torn by her compulsion to remain loyal to the throne after Killmonger takes it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe scene toward the end of the film when Okoye and Nakia voice their ideological differences is self-contained, but it\u2019s also an encapsulation of the debates that T\u2019Challa has been subtextually party to throughout the entire film. Their discourse is the foundation upon which T\u2019Challa\u2014and by extension, the rest of Wakanda\u2014builds his new ideology. What\u2019s most profound about the split between the two women is that the film goes out of its way to make sure the audience understands that neither of them is really in the wrong and that their parting of ways ends up being the right decision. Were it not for Nakia, Ramonda, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman), T\u2019Challa would without a doubt have been murdered. But Okoye staying close to the throne with the other Dora Milaje ends up putting her in the perfect position to rally her troops to rise up against Killmonger in Black Panther\u2019s climactic battle.\n\nBlack Panther wants us to listen to its women both because it\u2019s the right thing to do and because that\u2019s part of the egalitarian political society that it depicts Wakanda as being. A number of the other tribes that make up Wakanda\u2019s ruling elites are shown as being led by women, and Nakia herself is the appointed champion of the River Tribe who, should they choose to do so, would challenge T\u2019Challa in ritual combat for the throne. T\u2019Challa has faith in Nakia because of his personal relationship with her (and because she\u2019s right), but no matter what, Wakanda\u2019s culture still would have elevated her as a rightful potential claimant to the throne because she\u2019s the woman for the job.\n\nEven outside of Wakanda\u2019s politics or Black Panther\u2019s message about Wakanda\u2019s responsibilities, the women in the film are the force that propels the story forward. Shuri is the not only the scene-stealer of the film, but she\u2019s also the driving force behind Wakanda\u2019s most recent technological innovations. These end up not only saving her brother\u2019s life, directly and indirectly, on multiple occasions, but also all of Wakanda; without her, T\u2019Challa (and Ross) would be dead, Killmonger would rule Wakanda, and the entire world would be engulfed in vibranium-powered conflict. Meanwhile, the warriors of Okoye\u2019s Dora Milaje are the primary force that keeps Wakanda from collapsing entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut simply, it\u2019s the voices of Black Panther\u2019s women that ultimately make the movie so dynamic and help the movie lay a larger groundwork for future additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

And we can\u2019t breathe one word about that evening\u2019s red carpet without acknowledging our current and forever #Fave, Yara Shahidi. Like, we may have to come up with a concept stronger than #Goals to explain how we feel about her.\n\n\n\nWhen the 17-year-old shining star stepped on that SAG Awards red carpet, we collectively gasped\u2014and haven\u2019t taken a breath since. She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup. After doing some gushing about the magic they created, I was able to tease out step-by-step instructions on how to re-create the textured tresses and flawless makeup from the red carpet\u2014product details and all!\n\n\n\nHairstylist to the stars Nai\u2019vasha Johnson is the real deal, having magnified the manes of many of our celebrity faves, including Zendaya, Uzo Aduba, songbirds (and Yara\u2019s Grown-ish co-stars) Chloe x Halle, Dear White People\u2019s Logan Browning and Chewing Gum\u2019s Michaela Coel. Represented by Exclusive Artists Management, this celebrity hairstylist is a master, whether working with wigs and extensions, braided works of art or textured tresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all of this talent, Johnson is more than just a hair expert. She has often spoken up in support of female-focused platforms, as well as addressing some of the pressures put on black women to alter their hair for cultural approval. For this mother of two daughters\u2014one who has decided to keep her hair natural and another with a relaxer\u2014the priority is on healthy hair and a woman\u2019s right to choose and not feel pressured to conform. Her focus is healthy hair, in whatever form that means for any woman she is working with.\n\nTo achieve Yara\u2019s showstopping look last Sunday, Johnson used products from natural-hair-care maven Taliah Waajid. Johnson says: \u201cThe inspiration was glamorous Diana Ross. I wanted her beautiful texture delicately brushed out.\u201d\n\nJohnson graciously gave us a detailed step-by-step on how she created Yara\u2019s blown-out brown bombshell style for the SAG Awards:\n\nSaturate damp hair from root to tip with the Taliah Waajid Green Apple and Aloe Nutrition Leave-In Conditioner. Brush hair thoroughly with a boar-bristle brush to evenly distribute the product. Dry hair with a diffuser. Add a quarter size of Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream to define curls and add shine.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness.

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut by then it was already too late. Beauty influencers like Jackie Aina, Makeupshayla and Alissa Ashley took to their social media accounts and promptly got to roasting. It was so delicious, I almost stopped the videos to go grab marshmallows from the kitchen (every good roast has marshmallows).\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s sad, really. Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it. We\u2019re not only vocally speaking out, but we\u2019re also speaking with our dollars. We\u2019re supporting brands that support us, because companies will continue to think it\u2019s OK to underrepresent WOC until we show them otherwise. And we can show them otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["brand", "makeup", "going", "excluding", "color", "launch", "beige", "fenty", "brands", "tarte", "shades", "50", "beauty"], "polarity": 0.045807165376130894, "subjectivity": 0.5063292518464932},

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["probably", "students", "day", "shit", "arming", "going", "student", "teachers", "school", "policy", "class", "worst", "suggestions", "chris", "teacher"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly.

He is one of the premier makeup artists in the industry, and one of the few African-American artists to publish beauty books: Fine Beauty and Fine: The Basics of Beauty. His work epitomizes artistry and glamour, as evidenced on famous faces like Vanessa Williams, Iman, Queen Latifah, Gabrielle Union and Paula Patton.\n\nBut perhaps Sam is most famous for his eyebrow technique, which has become the industry standard and #BrowsOnFleek goals for just about every woman I know. But the rise of beauty vlogging and Insta-fame has also given rise to a lot of brow looks that, frankly, aren\u2019t for everyone. So on behalf of The Glow Up, I consulted with the expert for the ultimate how-to-eyebrow guide.\n\nThe Glow Up: What do the magic eyebrows do for the face?\n\nSam Fine: Everyone understands that brows bring great presence to the face. It\u2019s the one thing that is part of \u201cnatural beauty,\u201d whether you do makeup or no makeup at all. My mom would not be caught dead without putting on her brows to frame her face. Especially as women age, it\u2019s that one thing that brings back youth. Look at Instagram: Brows are very important again; they\u2019re that one facet that never leaves. Think of brows through the ages: Cleopatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Brooke Shields, you in the early \u201990s ...\n\nTGU: Kid and Play!\n\nSF: Shut up! You have to decide how much time you have to dedicate to brow maintenance. A lot of women don\u2019t have full eyebrows to work with; I think tweezing and threading are the best ways to remove unwanted hair and make ... even a very faint brow appear more substantial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Because it gives the brow a crisper line?\n\nSF: Women with thin brows are in awe when I do that, because they already didn\u2019t have \u201ca brow\u201d to begin with. But everyone has eyebrows; you just have to learn how to define it.\n\nTGU: Who should bleach and who shouldn\u2019t bleach, Sam?\n\nSF: Before we get to bleaching: pencil over powder. I prefer pencil. We\u2019re so blessed to have so many cosmetic lines, from Kevyn Aucoin to Anastasia to Hourglass and Troy Surratt. Using an angled pencil really helps you find the arch and the direction of the brow to help you fill it in fully, or you can use very thin pencils that are like individual pencil leads for a manicured approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnastasia has pomades where you can draw it in very heavy with an angled brush for a more Brooke Shields or early-\u201990s Veronica Webb brow. People who have very faint brows need something that\u2019s going to cover more territory, like those angled brushes, used with pomades, or an angled pencil, which are blocky, but they give you a faster stroke, and they\u2019re a bit faster to put on and fine-tune later.\n\nTGU: Where are you on, like, braided brows?\n\nSF: I hate you. Honestly, we\u2019re in an era of \u201cbeauty-tainment.\u201d A lot of what\u2019s going on in beauty is entertainment. You don\u2019t even find a lot of what\u2019s going on on Instagram even being sold at Sephora\u2014a lot of this stuff does not translate to the 9-to-5. Makeup is a personality. Women aren\u2019t taking these types of faces to work. So it\u2019s important to find a brow shape and a technique that speaks to your lifestyle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: \u201cBeauty-tainment.\u201d The same stuff that\u2019s happening with food on cooking shows. You can\u2019t eat half of it. It\u2019s just entertaining to watch.\n\nSF: I always compare makeup to food because of the preparation. I mean, most people are really Rachael Ray meals. They want 15- to 20-minute meals. I don\u2019t think women want to spend 90 minutes on makeup every morning.\n\nTGU: Give me advice for talking to the aesthetician if someone is going to get their brows done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSF: Now, you have brow and lash bars, kiosks in malls and salons that offer services. You really want to convey your personality. Ask them to draw them in, or show them the shape before you tweeze, thread or wax. I\u2019m not a fan of using razors on the brow. The brow grows back much faster, much more stubbly, than if you use other methods.\n\nAsk how long it\u2019s going to last between visits, and put your next appointment on the calendar. [Then] get the guidelines on how to fill in your brows and ask what are the best tools for your texture and brow shape; whether it\u2019s clear brow gel to hold the brow in place for a very dense eyebrow, or pomades, foundation or concealer to go around the brow.\n\nThat\u2019s not my thing, but they do offer really great pencils that make it easy for laymen to highlight underneath the brow area. I would choose an eye shadow that\u2019s a little bit more second skin, a little bit more natural looking, but the concealer pencils may help for people to understand what their brow is supposed to be. But they have to realize that they need a lesson and it takes practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do you still do the tutorials?\n\nSF: I have a DVD. It\u2019s at samfine.com. It\u2019s the basics of beauty. It\u2019s almost 10 years old, before we had a lot of \u2026\n\nTGU: You were YouTube before YouTube ...\n\nSF: You\u2019ll see a lot of my natural brow techniques. Some of what we\u2019re seeing on Instagram is more drawn on. I\u2019m not a fan of doing concealer around the brow, [though] it\u2019s very popular nowadays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: I tried it.\n\nSF: It can be very telltale if you\u2019re not an artist. What\u2019s happened today with Instagram is artists are showing their perspective in a way that\u2019s not always consumer-friendly. When you unleash these techniques on consumers, they\u2019re bound to be very telltale.\n\nMy goal, with having done my book and DVD Fine Beauty (also available on YouTube), is always to empower real women [so] that they can apply makeup in a seamless, effortless manner. If you give too much of a trend, it\u2019s very hard to follow. That\u2019s what we makeup artists do every day. That\u2019s not the consumer\u2019s strong suit; women are just trying to put their best face forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Thanks for helping us do that, Sam.

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["fans", "movie", "white", "work", "going", "wakanda", "panther", "look", "video", "internets", "finally", "black", "colston", "friends", "favorite", "lowe", "talk"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it?

To date, Kardashian and her merry band of familial pirates have stolen black women\u2019s hips, asses, lips, eyelashes, men, style, behaviors, ethos, attitude and demeanor, and, then, with the audacity of Rachel Dolezal, Kim, the point guard of the family, had the nerve to subtweet black women who pointed out to her that she was wearing cornrows, not some dumbass \u201cBo Derek braids.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand the idea of wanting to dismiss Kim and the Kardashian clan, including the one fully white one who now looks Armenian, but I also understand the historical plight of black women who\u2019ve been erased from history.\n\nMonday night\u2019s Twitter trolling of black women wasn\u2019t some new low (for Kim, the spoon has been stirring in this tea cup for some time), the subtweet actually signified a larger undoing\u2014she really doesn\u2019t give a shit. And the issue with this is that this silicone-injected butt with a working mouth has gone rogue, very rogue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is Kanye.\n\nKanye West is Kim\u2019s black husband and therefore her guide into black life. It\u2019s his job to explain to his wife why what she\u2019s been doing and continues to do is not only wrong, it\u2019s also hurtful, to black women. But don\u2019t expect Kanye to say anything anytime soon because we\u2019ve lost Kanye to a fate that has ruined many a black man before him: \u201cthe sunken place,\u201d aka Kim Kardashian\u2019s vagina. Reggie Bush, Kris Humphries, one of the little Jackson boys, some producer dude and Ray J have all fallen victim.\n\nReggie Bush could\u2019ve been the next Walter Payton. Kris Humphries could\u2019ve been the next Karl Malone. That little Jackson boy probably wasn\u2019t going to hit it big, and neither was that producer dude. But Ray J was not supposed to be the comical moped owner. Need I remind y\u2019all of this?\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure how to tell the brothers who fall for this act what\u2019s what, but adding a fake butt onto a regular woman is like putting nice rims on a Honda Accord. Yet the Kardashians remain modern-day quicksand for certain black men, and no matter how many times black women warn them that a Kardashian move isn\u2019t a good look; no matter how many men come out of the wringer more worse for wear, there\u2019s another black man standing off to the side like, \u201cHold my warmup jacket.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor these men, who routinely choose an obvious trap, the value-add has to be the white gaze. For them, the acceptance of their white plastic counterpart is like bitcoin; they don\u2019t fully understand it, but they know that they value it more than hard cash. They long for it.\n\nSad to say, but Kanye has been fawning for white approval for some time now. He wants desperately to be seen as the modern-day Steve Jobs and Walt Disney. He wants desperately to be accepted by the major fashion houses like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. He longs to be categorized among America\u2019s great whites, so much so that he\u2019s allowed himself to become the fawned-over black addition to the Kardashian circus.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen Kim\u2019s impact on Kanye\u2014the recluse who\u2019s had a nervous breakdown, yet also produced a fat-dad clothing line called \u201cCalabasas\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve not seen Kanye\u2019s impact on Kim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is partly because the Kardashian machine never changes. It runs on likes and retweets and other vapid forms of approval. It is all the stuff that all the psychologists have ever written about the id and the superego, all snapshot into one Instagram post. The machine stays the machine; the only changes happen to those who fall within its purview.\n\nIf you expected the bullish and outspoken Kanye to change the Kardashian template to look like an original forward-thinking woman who stopped pillaging the soul of black women, then you were wrong.\n\n\n\nWhile Kanye, an actual master craftsman masquerading as a genius, adds a legitimacy to Kim\u2019s Frankenstein-esque concoction, he doesn\u2019t seem to add a voice. I don\u2019t know where he is while his Armenian-and-white wife openly trolls black Twitter. I don\u2019t know what happened to the self-proclaimed mama\u2019s boy raised by a strong black woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier Kanye rapped, \u201cWhen he get on, he\u2019ll leave your ass for a white girl,\u201d and later Kanye did just that, but I didn\u2019t expect him to lose his voice.\n\nWhere\u2019s the gangster Kanye who stormed the stage to silence Taylor Swift with praise for Beyonc\u00e9? Where is the Kanye who said, \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d? Where is the Kanye who once claimed, \u201cKim doesn\u2019t understand what a blessing I am to her\u201d?\n\nThen bless her, Kanye, with the knowledge of appropriation. Bless her with the history of the slave trade. Tell her about the time Venus Williams had a point taken from her during the 1999 Australian Open because the beads from her braids kept falling onto the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I know that I\u2019m asking a lot.

That led to meeting Eileen Ford, the legendary owner of Ford Models. At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite.

Supermodel Cheryl Tiegs was in that picture.\n\n\n\nTGU: The path from model to actress seems to have been easy for you.\n\n\n\nDMR: I was a curious, adventurous woman. I had no qualms about walking through another door. My career and life have been luck, guided by a higher power.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What is the biggest life lesson modeling taught you?\n\n\n\nDMR: Modeling taught me about self-love, and to separate work from real life.

Chris was your typical badass: a little older than the rest of us, a little less interested in shit than the rest of us, basically coming to school because what the fuck else did he have to do while the rest of us were being educated? Chris was one of those students that teachers found impossible, and one teacher in particular\u2014we\u2019ll call her Mrs. Doe (her actual name escapes me, though I have THE most vivid memory of her face)\u2014was always being bothered by him.\n\nNearly every day, Mrs. Doe, who was extremely demure and passive, would plead with him to stop doing whatever he was doing and pay attention or she\u2019d send him to the principal\u2019s office. Chris\u2014who might have started the whole \u201cNo fucks to give\u201d movement single-handedly\u2014would always beg her to do it, with some invisible threat lingering between the two of them.\n\nOne day she did. He said he wasn\u2019t going. She yelled at him to get out of the classroom. He said \u201cno\u201d and sat there. She then decided she was going to go GET the principal to have him removed from her class. So she took off out of the classroom. Chris got up and followed her.\n\nHer classroom was on one end of the building and the principal\u2019s office was on the other. She stormed off toward the office with Chris hot on her heels. At some point, he either got too close for her comfort or she FELT like he got too close for her comfort because she took off running down the hallway with fear on her face. Chris took off running after her.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what was going on in Chris\u2019 head and why he thought ANY of this behavior would be the move. As was typical, after the dust settled, Chris was put out of her class and likely dished another suspension or a week\u2019s worth of in-school suspension\u2014at my school, that shit involved manual labor like cutting grass, weeding, cleaning up shit, etc. We all went back to our lives and the teacher went back to teaching whatever math or science class she was teaching. Chris came back to school. Wash, rinse, repeat (minus chasing teachers down the hallway).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were lots of students and teachers who came into the hallway to watch the melee unfold, since Mrs. Doe and Chris were yelling at each other on the way to the principal\u2019s office. Nobody died that day. Nobody was in danger of dying that day. But it\u2019s not hard to imagine that story having an ENTIRELY different ending had any of the teachers involved been toting a gun.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a reach to see this young man chasing a teacher and think that her life was in danger. And if someone had made a split-second decision with the belief that a student was putting a teacher\u2019s life in danger, Chris could have been killed in school by a teacher because he was being rowdy and acting inappropriately. Did he deserve to get shot because for that? Of course not. There\u2019s no excuse for his behavior, but is the death penalty a reasonable punishment?\n\nThat was the first story I thought of as I read opinions and heard lawmakers toss out the idea of arming teachers in schools in hopes of staving off future school shootings\u2014or at the very least minimizing the carnage. Yet my VERY first thought as a black man and black parent was that these folks will end up killing black boys and girls out of fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard being a public school teacher is. I have several friends who\u2019ve taught and are currently teaching in schools across America. I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like when a student threatens a teacher who digs into their bag of de-escalation tricks hoping that the situation resolves itself.\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not your only recourse? What if you have a gun nearby at all times and a student gets in your face? Do you pull the gun on them? Hell, the POLICE are trained in de-escalation tactics as a rule and fuck up plenty. It\u2019s their job. Somehow teachers, generally wanting to do nothing more than teach, are going to be better at NOT playing judge and executioner in the most damning way possible?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that all teachers would end up shooting students, but to think it wouldn\u2019t happen AND that armed teachers would discourage school shootings is stupid. Teachers are on the front lines of dealing with our kids. They\u2019re doing the Lord\u2019s work and trying their best to impart knowledge. Yet lots of students simply don\u2019t want to be there and make it difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my senior-year AP calculus class, several of us made it IMPOSSIBLE for our teacher, Ms. Tarter, to effectively teach us how to take all those damn derivatives. We\u2019d climb out of the window and let our feet dangle against the building. We\u2019d shine lights in her eyes. I remember once, I held up the class until everyone sang camp songs I felt like singing. Entirely inexcusable behavior, I know.\n\nSure, we\u2019d eventually pass our AP exams and get that college credit, but some of us were unruly, making it hard for other students to learn for no reason. And we were the \u201cgood\u201d kids, the kids that teachers nominated for awards.\n\nOn top of the obvious idea that a student would get shot by a teacher given the \u201cfear of my life\u201d benefit of the doubt, does anybody NOT think that some student would get ahold of a teacher\u2019s gun and shoot another student? All this student has to do is get past a teacher. Kids get into fights, beefs and scuffles every day. A kid who knows where a gun is and is hell-bent on shooting another student for whatever reason is going to make that happen. Nothing about arming teachers has any upside\u2014nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, no thoughtful body would ever pass any laws suggesting as much. It would be an entirely stupid and MORE dangerous offering than attempting to make it harder to get guns in the first place. But I guess lawmakers and presidents like to throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nWhile I know the NRA probably thinks that arming everybody is the best way to make sure fewer people get shot\u2014logic be damned\u2014I\u2019d hope that more levelheaded people would realize that teachers are there to teach, not to be an armed line of defense.\n\nOtherwise students like Chris, who need suspension or detention, could get buried instead.", "keywords": ["probably", "students", "day", "shit", "arming", "going", "student", "teachers", "school", "policy", "class", "worst", "suggestions", "chris", "teacher"], "polarity": 0.0061076817558299076, "subjectivity": 0.4876464824612973},

Killmonger definitely isn\u2019t \u201cgood,\u201d but he isn\u2019t entirely \u201cbad,\u201d either.\n\nHe\u2019s human, and he\u2019s got a motivation and perspective that Black Panther wants you to sit with and contemplate long after the second post-credit scene sequence ends. Killmonger is a very much a narrative villain who does the sort of things that bad guys do, but at the same time he\u2019s a person you can see yourself in all too clearly when you put yourself in his shoes.\n\nKillmonger has a perfectly understandable reason for harboring a deep resentment for the Wakandan royal family and, to a point, the country itself. Early in the film, we learn through a flashback that Killmonger\u2019s father N\u2019Jobu, a Wakandan prince-turned-spy embedded in Oakland, California, chose to betray Wakanda.\n\nBy partnering with Ulysses Klaue to steal vibranium from Wakanda, N\u2019Jobu strongly believed that he would have been able to set off a revolution designed to bring an end to Wakanda\u2019s isolationist politics, something he felt was for the greater good. To N\u2019Jobu, Wakanda\u2019s culture of secrecy and its noninterference in the affairs of other countries were a kind of social negligence that contributed to the oppression of black people across the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepending on how you look at it, N\u2019Jobu has a very, very good point. While present-day Wakanda is meant to be something on the order of 20 to 25 years ahead of the rest of the world, the implication is that in the past, the country was centuries ahead of its peers and thus was in a position to change the course of history\u2014especially as it relates to the African diaspora. N\u2019Jobu impressed these ideas upon his son and told Erik about the technological might of his home country, and the origins of their family tree. T\u2019Chaka\u2019s ultimate decision to execute N\u2019Jobu for his treason is understandable, but so too is the rage that his father\u2019s death sparks in Erik\u2014a rage amplified by the fact that T\u2019Chaka abandons his young, newly-orphaned nephew behind in America.\n\nImagine knowing that you were descended from the royalty of an African country that had the power to upend the racial hierarchies that brutalized other black people across the world. Not only that, but when presented with the opportunity to go back to that country, your very own family made a point of rejecting you in an effort to protect itself. You would feel hurt and lost, and most likely filled with a deep-seated rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik\u2019s predicament is the perfect crystallization of the inevitable tragedy that comes with fantasizing about a place like Wakanda where black people are truly free and unburdened by the impacts of institutionalized racism. Wakanda\u2019s very existence means that, for Erik, there\u2019s always a place where he could and would thrive in ways that he can barely imagine, but rather than being welcomed there, he\u2019s cast out and left to fend for himself. Erik is a stand-in for all of us who want to be part of Wakanda, even though Wakanda doesn\u2019t want part of anything else but itself. That\u2019s the harsh, canon reality of the Wakanda from Marvel\u2019s comics. The country is better off than the rest of the world and it is the kind of place where black people could flourish and prosper, but the Wakandans choose to keep to themselves, albeit for a number of obvious and valid reasons.\n\n\n\nThe enthusiasm with which we (and by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean black people) celebrate Wakanda is, in a way, somewhat at odds with the painful realities that would come along with the existence of such a country\u2014like the fact that they simply don\u2019t welcome outsiders. But there are heavier questions at hand as well. Where was Wakanda during the centuries when Western countries institutionalized the enslavement of Africans from other nations, during the Civil Rights era, or when other movements focused on the agitation for black equality?\n\nFrom both N\u2019Jobu and Killmonger\u2019s perspectives, the whole history of black pain and suffering at the hands of those who see us as less than is something that Wakanda could have changed if it chose to, but it didn\u2019t. Those who suffered and suffer have a right to be angry, and if you were in the same position as they were, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019d feel the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther poses these questions to its heroes in such a way that makes clear that the film doesn\u2019t wholly see Killmonger as a villain. He\u2019s grappling with a multigenerational grief over what could have been, both for him and black people as a global community; it makes sense that he would see seizing the throne as an opportunity to begin righting the wrongs that have hurt him so deeply.\n\n\n\nAs a concept, Wakanda\u2019s a vastly different place than when it was first introduced in Marvel\u2019s comics back in 1966. As more and more black fans and comics creators have come to love and create new stories for the Black Panther, Wakanda\u2019s become so much more than a thought experiment about what an African country would be like if it\u2019d been untouched and unconquered by colonizers. The Wakanda we celebrate in our excited conversations about Black Panther is a love letter to the African continent, those of us who carry it with us in our blood, and wear it on our skin. It\u2019s the Wakanda that N\u2019Jobu likely told Erik stories about when he was a young boy\u2014a wondrous place where his talents and potential would never be squandered or extinguished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger\u2019s story is tragic, but Black Panther expertly frames it as the ideal opportunity to confront the difficult questions we\u2019ve all asked ourselves about Wakanda. He\u2019s far from perfect\u2014indeed, he\u2019s a vicious killer. But he isn\u2019t exactly a villain, either. He\u2019s human and fragile and trying to work through a constellation of difficult, agonizing feelings. He\u2019s all of us.", "keywords": ["killmonger", "place", "erik", "wakanda", "panther", "black", "panthers", "love", "country", "loves", "hes", "didnt", "njobu", "wakandas"], "polarity": 0.07748868998869003, "subjectivity": 0.5189931164931162},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

I\u2019m here to ask for blessings for the rapper Post Malone. I know you are the creator of all things\u2014even this man who looks like the result of Pippi Longstocking fucking a semidomesticated billy goat. I read an article today about him in GQ where he was asked, \u201cDo you, Post Malone, ever feel anxious about working in a primarily black-identified genre of music?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer, Bijan Stephen, even noted his own feelings about Malone\u2019s hypocrisy when he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m black. I\u2019m young. I\u2019ve been put off by some of the things he\u2019s said about distancing himself from rap, from R&B, from anything, really, that\u2019s musically black-identified.\u201d\n\nStephen went on to explain: \u201cI enjoy Post\u2019s music, but I\u2019m skeptical: What\u2019s worse than appropriating a black sound without giving appropriate credit is doing that and not realizing why that might be wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Lord, you are the alpha and omega, and being that you are the only one in heaven or on earth who pledged two fraternities, I\u2019m sure you already knew this, our bright and morning star. In your omnipotence, I\u2019m sure you are aware of Post Malone\u2019s response, but Imma just type it out so the copyedit team won\u2019t ask me for the quote, Almighty One. Oh, ye Giver of Life, Death and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Post Malone said:\n\nI definitely feel like there\u2019s a struggle being a white rapper. But I don\u2019t want to be a rapper. I just want to be a person that makes music. I make music that I like and I think that kicks ass, that I think the people who fuck with me as a person and as an artist will like.\n\nOh, Lord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to still this slapping spirit that is rising in my heart and tingling in my palms!

I felt the same thing when I read that quote from Post Malone, and I need you to eject this reneging spirit from my soul, Most High!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, Big Poppa (yes, I\u2019ve heard the gospel hymn when you said you love it when we call you that), take Post Malone\u2019s hand and guide him through the misery of being a millionaire and being white. I know it must be hard for him to exist in a world where he has every societal advantage that comes with whiteness while simultaneously getting to wade in the pool of black culture.\n\nI imagine it tastes like fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good, Evil and White Privilege. Yea, though Post Malone walks through the valley of the shadow of cultural appropriation, comfort him with your rod and staff. Or beat him.\n\nPlease beat him.\n\nAnd forgive him, Your Highness.\n\nForgive him, for he knows not what he\u2019s doing when he makes millions from an art form created by black people while distancing himself from the individuals and the struggle that birthed the art by stiff-arming anything remotely related to blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive him for dabbling in the outlaw-thug stereotype while not recognizing the privilege of not having every aspect of himself associated with the oppression and danger that goes along with his inverted shucking and jiving.\n\nOh, my Good & Plenty higher power, I know some will say that he is not guilty of cultural appropriation, but if hip-hop is a culture, and the definition of appropriation is \u201cthe deliberate reworking of images and styles from earlier, well-known works of art\u201d without attribution or acknowledgment, and Malone doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that he is a rapper, then I don\u2019t know what else to call him, dear Lord.

Although I sat right in the middle of the theater rocking a heather-gray sweatshirt with T\u2019Challa emulating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute, a couple of white film critics must not have noticed me and proceeded to have quite the interesting exchange that I ear-hustled. It went a little something like this \u2026\n\nCritic A: I\u2019m really sick of the hype.\n\nCritic B: I know, it\u2019s been a lot.\n\nCritic A: You think it\u2019s going to live up to the hype?\n\nCritic B: If it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to be that guy who writes the bad review.\n\nCritic A: I know. With all of the \u201cmovements\u201d going on, even if it isn\u2019t that good, you can\u2019t write a bad thing about it.\n\nCritic B: Exactly.\n\nOnce the credits rolled, a sense of pride swelled in my chest considering that, in my humble opinion, Black Panther lived up to the hype. However, I couldn\u2019t help eavesdropping on the film critics who spoke before the film to get their thoughts.\n\nUltimately, they thought the movie was good but not great, and ranked it somewhere in the middle of the 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that have been released since 20o8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI left the movie theater wondering how many other film critics felt the same way about Black Panther but refused to be those critics. After all, everyone saw how Irish Independent\u2019s Ed Power was raked over the coals on social media after his negative review apparently broke Black Panther\u2019s 100 percent-positive Rotten Tomatoes rating. Is a bad review of a movie with so much hype and cultural relevance to a community worth the perceived backlash?\n\nAnd with that, does that mean that Black Panther has been graded on a curve?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it wasn\u2019t necessarily the fact that Power gave the film a negative review. Instead, it was the rationale behind the review (T\u2019Challa didn\u2019t beat up enough bad guys) that drew the ire of fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there may be other critics like the ones I overheard at the theater who think that black folks aren\u2019t willing to accept a critical review, and will therefore grade the film on a curve for fear of being attacked on social media. That method of thinking reduces African Americans to an irrational collective that is of the same mind. And that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nNot everyone in the African-American community loved Black Panther, for a variety of reasons, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nSurely, one scan of your social media timeline will find many debates regarding whether or not the movie lived up to the hype. It\u2019s what makes Black Panther such a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that we can debate about a blockbuster superhero movie with a predominantly black cast, a black lead and a black director bears a great deal of significance. Don\u2019t get it confused: We can accept a negative review from a nonblack film critic as long as the words back up the grade.\n\nOn the flip side, there are contrarians for the sake of being contrarians in the African-American community who made their decision long ago that they wouldn\u2019t like the film. One black film critic who tore the film to shreds was the National Review\u2019s Armond White (cinema\u2019s Jason Whitlock, if you will).\n\nFor the uninitiated, White has long been considered a contrarian troll in the film-critic community. He\u2019s responsible for the first review to break Get Out\u2019s 100 percent-positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and has served up negative reviews for universally acclaimed films including The Dark Night and Toy Story 3, while praising other lowly rated films such as Jonah Hex and Grown Ups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut Oedipal conflict is too serious for the Marvel Comic Universe, so careerist [Ryan] Coogler gets distracted from his real subject and creates a kind of ideological retreat in which Afrocentricity becomes an opportunistic folly,\u201d White writes of Black Panther. \u201cUnlike biracial Vin Diesel\u2019s The Chronicles of Riddick, which translated racial and political awareness into a quasi-classical drama, Black Panther marginalizes its white characters: \u2018Another broken white boy for us to fix,\u2019 a Wakanda scientist rhetorically spears a CIA outsider. Its focus is on what masculinity means for heartbroken black boys.\u201d\n\nYou read that right. He compared Black Panther to The Chronicles of Riddick in terms of how those films dealt with the subject of race.\n\nUntil there are more African-American movie critics who are part of the Rotten Tomatoes algorithm to balance out nonsense like this, there will remain a curiosity as to whether these reviewers are being 100 percent honest about a mainstream film that is by and about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome white critics may not be able to relate to the themes presented, and the movie may not resonate with them. Also, it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that some white critics might have racial biases that affect how they critique a film. But that\u2019s pretty much how black folks have felt about the vast majority of films to which we cannot relate, but upon which are heaped tremendous praise by film critics.\n\nHopefully, a balance will eventually be struck between the racial makeup of films and the writers who critique them. Fortunately, Black Panther has received its fair share of praise by the people who needed that escapism in a world where Donald Trump\u2019s hate-filled rhetoric routinely infests our news broadcasts.

According to the Associated Press, Ibrahim Gaidam, the governor of the Yobe state, initially set the number of girls who were missing at 84, but family members quickly rejected the tally and issued a list of missing daughters, totaling 105.\n\n\u201cThis list did not come from the school management or any government source but collated by us from the parents of the girls,\u201d said Bashir Manzo, who is heading up the efforts to locate the stolen students. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, the governor is still being fed with fake information about these poor girls.\u201d\n\nFormer, But Still My President Barack Obama sent troops to Chad after the militant Islamic group kidnapped 200 Nigerian girls in 2014. While Obama was criticized for his delay in sending help, Chad became a U.S. ally in the fight against Boko Haram and its military is considered one of the most capable and stable in the region. The country had dedicated more than 2,000 troops to the war against the extremists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2015, Boko Haram controlled territory in West Africa the size of Belguim, but a combination Nigerian and Chadian forces gained almost all of it back. Boko Haram had almost been totally defeated in the region. The country\u2019s military also played a huge role in cooling tensions in Mali and was most prominently fighting terrorists in Niger.\n\nAnd then, Donald Trump issued his travel ban.\n\nAlthough geopolitical experts couldn\u2019t figure out why the executive order included Chad, the Trump administration pointed out that there were a number of terrorist groups in the area, which is exactly why you don\u2019t piss off the people most capable of fighting them! Others speculated that Trump\u2019s decision might have something to do with Chad being a majority Muslim country. And a black country.

After it dropped, Lena Waithe hit the tweets to ask folks what they thought about it. Those opinions ranged, but it didn\u2019t seem like anybody was ready to call for a boycott of Netflix over its release. And if you watched it, there\u2019s a very good reason for this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStep Sisters is absurd, ridiculous, cute, bad, good, kinda funny, cringeworthy-level unfunny, stereotypically stereotypical, paint-by-number, a knockoff Bring It On Pitch Perfect Stomp the Yard Don\u2019t Be a Menace, entirely unbelievable, unrealistic, heartwarming and curiously WTF. The script needs all the work and it needs all the injections of humor. But it\u2019s also kind of enjoyable at times.\n\nDo you remember Jumping the Broom, the T.D. Jakes-helmed movie about bringing together two families from opposite sides of the track for the wedding of the girl who had it all and the guy who had it rough, starring Laz Alonzo and Paula Patton? It seemed like an attempt at making a more respectable Tyler Perry movie. Except for the first time ever, I wished that Perry had been part of a project, since it would at least have been funny. Scripts matter and levity works. Throwing tropes on-screen doesn\u2019t mask bad writing and a thin premise.\n\nWelcome to Step Sisters.\n\nThe first 15 minutes of Step Sisters were possibly some of the worst 15 minutes of a movie I\u2019ve watched in a long time. Nuance? Fuck nuance. Let\u2019s just overdo shit. Jamilah (Megalyn Echikunwoke), the movie\u2019s star and member of black Greek-letter organization Theta Chi Phi, really wants to go to Harvard Law School and join her super-woke caricature white boyfriend, Dane (played by Matt McGorry), who sends ankh emojis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut her parents, both Harvard alums, refuse to write her the recommendation that is the only impediment to her acceptance. So let me get this right. A black family REFUSES to help their only child get into Harvard so that she learns how to do shit on her own, even though they know it will help her get where she\u2019s trying to go in life? And she\u2019s a good student and model sorority member and is active with her community work.\n\nThat is literally the jumping-off point. The only thing that helps here is that Jamilah\u2019s mother, played by Sheryl Lee Ralph, absolutely hates Michelle Obama, and they make it a running joke. That? Funny. Who hates Michelle Obama?\n\nOne of the white chicks in Sigma Beta Beta, a white sorority, gets caught banging a dude in a bush at a party, and their charter is up for revocation unless they get an image makeover. Enter a super-inappropriate dean of student affairs who guarantees Jamilah\u2019s entry to Harvard by providing the recommendation she so badly needs if she fixes that shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how this goes from here. The SBBs are apprehensive, but they take her up on the offer to teach them how to step to enter a charity step show and rehab their image. Except Jamilah has to hide this from her sorority sisters, who are understandably against the idea of white girls stepping. Also, oddly, the head of the SBBs has a brother who is black who ends up wooing Jamilah with zombies and the Cars. Yes, the rock group. They go from zero to 100, nigga, real quick.\n\nThe SBBs, of course, fuck up their first foray into stepping, kind of like how the Barden Bellas fucked up their first attempt at a show in Pitch Perfect. But they decide to give it another go and finally start to understand sisterhood. Which is when Jamilah\u2019s life goes to shit. She loses her job, her sorority sisters, her mother and Harvard and decides to leave school to finish her degree through a correspondence course. It\u2019s like Randolph and Mortimer Duke from Trading Places decided to ruin her life. For a dollar.\n\nThe white girls (and one SBB black girl) get it together eventually, step in a regional comp and get jobbed by the judges even though they placed but didn\u2019t win, and Jamilah\u2019s soror and SBB\u2019s biggest critic, played by Naturi Naughton, comes to their defense to make sure they get their just due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we all smile and shit. One friend of mine even said she shed tears. Truth is, the script isn\u2019t terrible. It\u2019s not good, either. The execution is nowhere NEAR as good as it could be. The script needed more humor and we had to suspend too much reality. How is it possible that this super-popular black head of her sorority is able to attend SBB events and help these white chicks learn to step, and her entire sorority has no idea EVEN though she enlists the help of other black fraternity members? Nobody talks??? And again, the whole \u201cMy parents who love me and realize how awesome I am decided they want me to earn my stripes the old-fashioned way\u201d premise makes no sense.\n\nMegalyn is good in her role. And the white chicks (and the black one) are interesting as her test cases. They are likable. And Lyndon Smith as Danielle, the leader of the SBBs, plays a good foil for Jamilah. Yes, this is a movie about white women appropriating stepping culture and getting some credit for being white doing black stuff, but it doesn\u2019t feel too white. Admittedly, the second time I watched\u2014that\u2019s how much I love you people; I\u2019ve watched it more than once\u2014I found myself liking it more than I did the first time. To be fair, I also liked Tupac\u2019s song \u201cJust Like Daddy\u201d after repeated listenings, too, so there\u2019s that.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for this movie to be anything more than a tale of white girls falling over themselves trying to compete at a black art\u2014and why would you be?\u2014you\u2019ll actually be disappointed. It isn\u2019t deep or going to truly illustrate anything about campus race relations among Greeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s a decent movie about relationships in general and overcoming adversity and not giving up. And the SBBs do a good job in the final step show, as opposed to the PURE ASS they are in the first step show, where they tried to prove to everybody else that they could do it. If you\u2019re looking for a ridiculous movie where white chicks fall all over themselves but then come together and the black lead character is awesome and does a good job with the material she\u2019s given, this is your jammy jam.\n\nCan I recommend it? Eh. If you have nothing better to do with your time and are tired of watching any of the Fast and Furious movies that seem to run ad nauseam, then it\u2019s a good respite. It\u2019s not the worst movie you\u2019ll ever see at all. I assure you that you\u2019ve seen worse movies. And it is enjoyable in parts. And most important, it does get better, even though I did want to throw my iPad out of the window because of the final competition. But I also expected them to lame out and have the white girls win, and since they didn\u2019t, I have to give some credit.\n\nSo if you like movies with black people and your Netflix queue tells you that You Got Served is popular on Netflix? Step Sisters is your lane. If not, don\u2019t worry; P did that so hopefully you don\u2019t have to go through that.", "keywords": ["movie", "shit", "white", "best", "netflixs", "times", "sorority", "sisters", "black", "step", "watched", "worst", "good", "sbbs", "harvard"], "polarity": 0.11269323671497584, "subjectivity": 0.5883183804922933},

Kennedy\u2019s number of 11 appointees, according to Time magazine.\n\nWhat also sets Trump\u2019s nominees apart is their relative youth, inexperience and, most important, their whiteness. Federal appeals court judgeships are lifetime appointments, and the average age of Trump\u2019s nominees is 48 years old. Compare that with the average age of Obama\u2019s appointees during his first term, which was 53, Slate reports. This means that Trump\u2019s judges will probably sit on the bench longer, pleasing his conservative base.\n\nMany federal judges work well into their 80s, meaning that the new young judges could serve through seven presidential terms (when the Sasha Obama-Blue Ivy administration takes office). Tim Head, executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said thanks to Trump and Senate Republicans: \u201cThe federal judiciary is being reshaped for an entire generation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee how that works?\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, 53 of Trump\u2019s 58 nominees are white, and only one is African American. Trump has not nominated a woman of color. That stands in stark contrast with Obama, who made a point of diversifying the federal bench. Only 31 percent of Obama\u2019s first-year appointees were white men. More than two-thirds of Trump\u2019s appointees are white males.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we know that Trump has an affinity to mediocre white men, not only are Trump\u2019s picks white and young\u2014they are unqualified. A full 8 percent of Trump\u2019s picks have been rated \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, a mark not seen since the 1960s, according to CNN.\n\nThis number includes Leonard Steven Grasz, who was confirmed to the 8th Circuit despite the fact that no judge with a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating has been confirmed since the Lyndon Johnson administration. It also includes Trump nominee Brett Talley, even though he had never served as a judge, argued a motion or tried a case. And then there was Matthew Petersen, who did this:\n\nEven the nominees who are qualified adhere to the Trump clique\u2019s unique brand of diet racism displayed by Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions. Take Thomas Farr, for instance, whom civil rights leader the Rev. William Barber II called a product of the \u201cmodern white supremacist machine.\u201d Farr began his career working for segregationist and former Sen. Jesse Helms. While employed by Helms, Farr sent postcards to black voters warning them about voting illegally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFarr has spent the last decade traveling around the country defending voter restriction and voter-ID laws passed by Republican legislatures. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said that North Carolina\u2019s voter-ID laws targeted black voters \u201cwith almost surgical precision,\u201d it was speaking directly to Thomas Farr. So what is Farr\u2019s punishment for losing that case?\n\nHe is the current nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\nDespite their shortcomings, racism and whiteness, Senate Republicans are confirming Trump\u2019s nominees at breakneck speed. The Hill reports that GOP lawmakers are considering a change to Senate rules that shortens the amount of time senators can debate a judicial nominee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does all of this mean for black people? It means that even if Trump is impeached or decides not to run, he may have inextricably changed the judiciary for the next five years. These changes are reflected in how justice is carried out across the country. Voter-ID laws were struck down by federal courts. A federal court ruled against his travel ban.\n\n\n\nI bet you\u2019re wondering why Trump would nominate someone to the bench who was as unqualified as these men. Especially someone as obviously incapable as Matthew Petersen, who was nominated to fill the empty seat in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Why does this matter to Trump and, more important, what does he receive in return?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, if the grand jury returns an indictment against Donald Trump, Jared Kushner or any of the people being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s FBI investigation, that case will be heard in\u2014you guessed it\u2014the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nSee how it works?", "keywords": ["works", "supremacy", "district", "white", "court", "nominees", "bench", "judges", "quietly", "number", "trumps", "administration", "trump", "fight", "winning", "shows", "federal"], "polarity": 0.08110957261692556, "subjectivity": 0.45513278796367035},

Not because her distinct sound of music sounded as if one of God\u2019s angels drank a fifth of gin and figured out a way to plug an extension cord into its harp. It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["woman", "rock", "roll", "music", "sister", "gospel", "queer", "invented", "recorded", "black", "tharpe", "n", "little", "rosetta"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

I remember when Drumline: A New Beat (effectively Drumline 2) came out on VH1 (and was terrible), black folks had a field day tearing it to shreds. But this shit right here? This shit right here, my nigga? I almost feel like I need to stretch, smoke a cigarette and drink some yak with Shannon Sharpe before I open up Twitter when this movie releases, and I only do one of the three aforementioned things ever (spoiler alert: It\u2019s drink yak minus Shannon Sharpe).\n\nLet\u2019s break down the premise, based on the just-released trailer (above): White chicks need saving. Black woman gets extorted, ends up saving white chicks with art. It\u2019s like reverse Freedom Writers, minus the extortion plotline. That\u2019s the short version. Here\u2019s the long version (from IMDb):\n\n\n\nJamilah has her whole life figured out. She\u2019s the president of her black sorority, captain of their champion step dance crew, is student liaison to the college dean, and her next move is on to Harvard Law School. She\u2019s got it all, right? But when the hard-partying white girls from Sigma Beta Beta embarrass the school, Jamilah is ordered to come to the rescue. Her mission is to not only teach the rhythmically-challenged girls how to step dance, but to win the Steptacular, the most competitive of dance competitions. With the SBB\u2019s reputations and charter on the line, and Jamilah\u2019s dream of attending Harvard in jeopardy, these outcast screw-ups and their unlikely teacher stumble through one hilarious misstep after another. Cultures clash, romance blossoms, and sisterhood prevails as everyone steps out of their comfort zones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty much the prequel to this Washington Post story about the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga.\n\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m going to watch this. Some may decide it\u2019s not their ministry. I\u2019m not one of them; I\u2019m going to church. I watch enough terribly produced movies to grant myself some grace here and watch a well-produced potential train wreck. So if you refuse to watch, that\u2019s cool, I got you. With that being said and based on the trailer alone, here are 10 reasons I plan to watch Step Sisters on Jan. 19:\n\n1. Because it exists.\n\nIf you have a bad movie featuring black people, I will watch it. I\u2019m not even embarrassed by my Netflix \u201cPopular on Netflix\u201d list or Amazon Prime-recommended movies anymore. I only wish they\u2019d suggest shit that had better production value. Point is, if it exists and there are black people, there\u2019s a better than 99 percent chance that I will press play. It turns out that there\u2019s a thin line between supporting black folks and masochism at times, and the black cinematic arts sometimes prove this to be true, but that has yet to slow my black-movie roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. It looks like a mix between Stomp the Yard, Pitch Perfect, Bring It On and Save the Last Dance.\n\nI love Pitch Perfect. I love Stomp the Yard. I went to the actual movie theater to see Bring It On in Atlanta as an HBCU college student and enjoyed it tremendously. Save the Last Dance is not without its charm, though it\u2019s pretty much a Magical Negro(es) movie as a bunch of streetwise black kids help influence a white woman\u2019s dancing, getting her into Juilliard. Bagger Vance would be so proud. Point is, I like enough of those movies to watch a Girl Talk-style movie version of them all, even knowing the product is problematic.\n\n3. I like to know what I\u2019m mad at and make sure I\u2019m mad about the right shit.\n\nWe know that this movie is going to be all types of problematic. I don\u2019t care how many black people are associated with the making of this movie; creating art that \u2019pacifically encourages and shows how cultural appropriation is borne and how we give away our art is some malarkey. So I need to watch it JUST to make sure I\u2019m mad about all of the appropriate things. Though I seriously doubt that white America is going to watch this in droves, so stepping might be mostly safe. Might be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. It looks like there will be high comedy.\n\nIt\u2019s a movie that focuses on white people trying to rhythmically move with and without music. I don\u2019t care who you are, that\u2019s funny.\n\n5. It also looks wildly entertaining.\n\nI get it! Appropriation. I know. Purge me, my sweet brotha Numpsy. And yet, the trailer is intriguing. Again, Pitch Perfect meets Save the Last Dance. Pitch Perfect is one of the best unintentionally awesome movies ever. I\u2019m not missing another one of those.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. For the culture.\n\nSomebody has to take the L, since I imagine lots of people will boycott (maybe \u201cboycott\u201d is too strong a word; perhaps \u201cignore with purpose\u201d?). Of course, lots of people are \u201cboycotting\u201d the NFL, too, except in Philadelphia, where I imagine \u201cunless the Eagles have a good season\u201d is in the fine print on the \u201cBoycott the NFL\u201d memo circulating around African America.\n\n7. The setting is the Atlanta University Center\u2019s Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University.\n\nI saw Graves Hall (Morehouse\u2019s most important building) in the trailer and smiled much like I do with any movie that features Morehouse\u2019s campus, like Hidden Figures, Stomp the Yard, Drumline, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. I\u2019ve rather enjoyed every single thing Naturi Naughton has been a part of ... that I\u2019ve seen.\n\n3LW (OK, that\u2019s a reach), Notorious, Power. Even Lottery Ticket. Maybe I\u2019ll enjoy her in this, too.\n\n9. The black leads all seem to be too old to play college students, and yet here we are. The white people all had to be ... younger.\n\nI typically enjoy watching living proof that black don\u2019t crack. It\u2019s a form of #BlackExcellence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I have a running list of Magical Negroes, and I like to stay current.\n\nBagger Vance. John Coffey. Morgan Freeman. Olivia Pope. Morpheus. Anthony Mackie\u2019s character in The Adjustment Bureau. Neil deGrasse Tyson. Barack Obama. All the black kids in Save the Last Dance. The movie version of Michael Oher in The Blindside, which doubles also as the greatest white-savior movie of all time\u2014a Magical Negro-white-savior-Remember the Titans-esque trifecta of feel-good shit. Cam Newton, because his haberdashery is the stuff of Magical Negro legend. As you can see, the list grows, and the characters of Step Sisters look primed to be in that number.", "keywords": ["movie", "dance", "white", "going", "netflixs", "reasons", "version", "trailer", "im", "sisters", "watch", "black", "step", "likely"], "polarity": 0.1534192681753657, "subjectivity": 0.5310435364093901},

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here, too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people were paying close attention to actors of South and East African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see every day\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of Africanness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sports radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by, but still, Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help shedding a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["audiences", "movie", "africa", "film", "told", "panther", "humanizing", "african", "africans", "knew", "wakanda", "going", "black", "hail", "characters"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked. Internships are a critical part of the process for successful careers, and Fashion Tech Connects is there to provide qualified candidates with both education and, for those who rise to the top, entree into coveted fashion internships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we look at the current landscape of technology and fashion leadership, there is an obvious lack of women of color,\u201d says Horton, whose new executive role at Alexander Wang was reportedly the inspiration behind this season\u2019s fashion show, featuring models dressed as an army of high-powered female executives.\n\nIf Horton has her way, squads of black female power brokers are about to be on the next runway to reality 2.0.", "keywords": ["business", "stephanie", "horton", "york", "alexander", "wang", "women", "doesnt", "soars", "tech", "marketing", "fashion", "vogue", "executive"], "polarity": 0.19978698550127125, "subjectivity": 0.4454098811241669},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["rock", "ankara", "appropriationvsappreciation", "ankhs", "trend", "fashion", "african", "kwanzaa", "stella", "argument", "ongoing", "black", "love", "style", "right", "know", "wearing", "way"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

And while you didn\u2019t go full Wakandan cosplay for the premiere, you did wear all black. Even copped a beret from the beret-copping store. And of course, you loved the film. Couldn\u2019t stop raving about it. Even plan to see it again next weekend.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend, whom you saw it with, loved it, too. And she\u2019s also planning to see it again. Not with you, though\u2014with her girlfriends. They planned an entire evening, actually. The movie and then group massages.

According to the Associated Press, Ibrahim Gaidam, the governor of the Yobe state, initially set the number of girls who were missing at 84, but family members quickly rejected the tally and issued a list of missing daughters, totaling 105.\n\n\u201cThis list did not come from the school management or any government source but collated by us from the parents of the girls,\u201d said Bashir Manzo, who is heading up the efforts to locate the stolen students. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, the governor is still being fed with fake information about these poor girls.\u201d\n\nFormer, But Still My President Barack Obama sent troops to Chad after the militant Islamic group kidnapped 200 Nigerian girls in 2014. While Obama was criticized for his delay in sending help, Chad became a U.S. ally in the fight against Boko Haram and its military is considered one of the most capable and stable in the region. The country had dedicated more than 2,000 troops to the war against the extremists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2015, Boko Haram controlled territory in West Africa the size of Belguim, but a combination Nigerian and Chadian forces gained almost all of it back. Boko Haram had almost been totally defeated in the region. The country\u2019s military also played a huge role in cooling tensions in Mali and was most prominently fighting terrorists in Niger.\n\nAnd then, Donald Trump issued his travel ban.\n\nAlthough geopolitical experts couldn\u2019t figure out why the executive order included Chad, the Trump administration pointed out that there were a number of terrorist groups in the area, which is exactly why you don\u2019t piss off the people most capable of fighting them!

Trump\u2019s insults and \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies likely signaled to Boko Haram that the U.S. intervention that took place under Obama was probably not going to happen during the Trump administration.\n\nAnd now the newly-emboldened Boko Haram has stolen 105 girls, thanks in part to the hands-off, shade-throwing Trump administration. When asked to comment on the missing Nigerian girls, Donald Trump expressed his support by taking a break from excusing white supremacists, golfing at Mar-a-Lago and tongue-kissing the National Rifle Association\u2019s chapped, wrinkled balloon knot to say:\n\nWell ... we\u2019ll let you know when he says something.", "keywords": ["racist", "troops", "105", "haram", "boko", "nigerian", "obama", "missing", "country", "girls", "chad", "donald", "trump", "idiot"], "polarity": 0.09729166666666667, "subjectivity": 0.43229166666666663},

She was a friend of black America\u2019s enemy, which, by definition, made her an enemy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe accepted her $179,000-per-year salary and paraded around in front of black America as if she were anything but a sock puppet at whom the Trump administration pointed when they explained that they couldn\u2019t be racist because they had a black friend. She wasn\u2019t drafted. She was a free agent who freely decided to jump on the bandwagon of the team that excused white supremacist terrorists, traded in Islamophobia and used anti-immigrant sentiment to gain power. Now that the team has issued her walking papers and given her instructions on where she should avoid letting the doorknob hit, we should not feel sorry for singing, \u201cNa na na na, hey hey hey ... goodbye!\u201d\n\nSo don\u2019t feel bad about rejoicing over Omarosa\u2019s misfortune. Be petty. Laugh at her when you spot her at the unemployment office. She is the one who chose to stiff-arm black people and join the parade of white nationalists, xenophobes and \u201calt-right\u201d advocates.\n\nPeople like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele and others who have been banned from the barbecue festivities never had anything much to offer anyway.

We\u2019re talking about the powerful women of the Dora Milaje and the scene-stealing M\u2019Baku (Winston Duke), and we even got a new handshake to share with our folk.\n\nGIF\n\nBut as excitement reached its peak after our first look, or looks, at the blockbuster, so have cries of #TeamTChalla\u2014better known as Black Panther\u2014vs. #TeamKillmonger (Michael B. Jordan). But as hell-bent as Killmonger seems to be on black liberation, support for anti-hero/villain Killmonger (Wakandan name: N\u2019Jadaka) may be misplaced, because it clearly comes with a side of toxic masculinity.\n\nDuring my first\u2014and second\u2014viewing of the film, I was undeniably moved by Killmonger. He spoke with the pained voice of black America, a voice that\u2019s been disconnected from its African roots and stifled and silenced by centuries of oppression. One of his first lines in the film is to ask the white female curator of an African art exhibit: \u201cHow do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price for it? Or did they take them, like they took everything else?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my theater, a cheer rose from the audience of mostly black folk. When he later pointed out that Wakanda has just been chilling on the sidelines while billions of black folk around the world were suffering, I heard more than a few folks say, \u201cYasss\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He definitely had a point: Black liberation has always been a debate between tactical resistance and revolution by any means necessary. So it\u2019s not surprising that as more and more think pieces emerge, many are split between #TeamKillmonger and #TeamTChalla.\n\nBut after viewing the movie a second time, I noticed Killmonger\u2019s hella problematic approach to liberation (shoutout to Oakland, Calif.). In a movie that otherwise unabashedly celebrates black women, his actions express a deep misogynoir that begins with the killing of his nameless girlfriend and extends through his scoffing at his aunt, the regal Ramonda (Angela Bassett); choking a female elder/shaman; murdering one of the Dora Milaje; injuring Nakia; and nearly killing Shuri.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillmonger repeatedly expresses his desire to demolish white European supremacy in favor of a black empire. His analysis of the European oppressors who stole, raped and pillaged their way across the world is not inaccurate. Black people all over the world (except the fictional Wakanda) have had their asses kicked by colonialism. But even with expansive technology and wealth at his fingertips, the only way Killmonger can think to correct this is by mimicking the behavior of the colonizer. He is not merely desiring justice but is lusting for revenge. He\u2019s not on a mission for liberation; he wants annihilation. His brutality is the very embodiment of toxic masculinity.\n\nIn a movie where no character uttered the n-word and black womanhood was centered, Killmonger\u2019s violence toward women\u2014black women in particular\u2014was stark and pronounced. Is this what we think of black American men? With a black American man helming the movie, it would be troubling to think that Killmonger could be read as unilaterally representative of black American male consciousness.\n\nErik Stevens, later Killmonger, is a black male character raised in America\u2014in Oakland, to be precise, the birthplace of the actual Black Panthers. He is a fictional black child whose mother we never see on-screen, who then grows into a black man who has seen violence both personal (the murder of his father) and political (the Rodney King verdict and the Los Angeles riots).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens has presumably watched and taken notes on the political realities of America; two years after his father\u2019s death, President Bill Clinton would sign the 1994 crime bill that exponentially increased the black prison population. He escapes that fate by attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joining the CIA and becoming a political mercenary. He is a product of his upbringing, and his rage is justified.\n\nBut Black Panther presents another path to global black freedom for its audience to consider. Instead of #TeamTChalla or #TeamKillmonger, why aren\u2019t we #TeamNakia?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom almost her first appearance in Black Panther, the character of Nakia told T\u2019Challa about himself and Wakanda, that their country couldn\u2019t idly sit back and watch the world annihilate blackness. She, embracing an arguably more Afrofuturist mindset, wanted restorative justice and liberation for black people across the world\u2014not with guns but with the blessing of Wakandan aid\u2014through their expansive technology and wealth. While it\u2019s true that sometimes revolution requires that we be armed, Nakia\u2019s point of view argued that we cannot rely solely on military might to accomplish our collective goals.\n\nComparing Nakia\u2019s and Erik\u2019s visions for liberation invites us to examine our values when it comes to revolution. And while I don\u2019t agree with everything in TaLynn Kel\u2019s article \u201cAn American Monster in Wakanda,\u201d she does have a point about the complicity of everyone but the character of Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o):\n\n\n\n\ufeffNakia knew it wasn\u2019t enough, which was why she could not stay. Would not stay and in the end, should not stay. Wakanda was complicit in the genocide of millions while looking at those suffering not with compassion, but with dismissal. Wakanda Forever really meant Wakanda first and only. Ignoring genocide doesn\u2019t exempt you from responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two visions of how we get free also ask us to take a look at our views about gender and masculinity\u2014and how our own silence often equals violence. As 45 percent of ticket buyers during Black Panther\u2019s opening weekend were women, there is also a call for us to bear witness to the ways in which we\u2014especially as black women\u2014are complicit in toxic masculinity in our social movements.\n\nIn a poignant moment after they both believe that T\u2019Challa has been murdered, his general, Okoye (Danai Gurira), and Nakia confront each other. Okoye pledges to serve the throne unconditionally, while Nakia wants to save the country (and black people), but not in service to Killmonger. It\u2019s reminiscent of the ways in which some black women will unconditionally support and protect black men who are obviously dangerous to our communities (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, etc.) in favor of protecting the idea of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut liberation cannot come on the backs of black women. We have to resist glorifying the character in the story that represents a problematic bag of liberation goals. It is not enough to claim a desire to free black folk, all while murdering, assaulting and disposing of black women. It is not enough to fight for justice while undergirding it with vengeance. Liberation must be for all.\n\nI need to be clear: I love Black Panther for so many reasons, including the way that it\u2019s pushing us to have some much-needed conversations. So much of the film resonated with me, even Killmonger\u2019s poignant last words: \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships. Because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d Those words burned me to my soul.\n\nAs a character, Killmonger reminded me of the oft-quoted James Baldwin: \u201cTo be black and conscious in America is to be in a constant state of rage.\u201d But I also know that when rage is directed solely into vengeance and not justice\u2014at the expense of black women and in the form of blind violence against them\u2014then who are we, if not mirroring our oppressors?", "keywords": ["trouble", "killmonger", "wakanda", "women", "character", "worship", "teamtoxicmasculinity", "black", "liberation", "teamkillmonger", "think", "violence", "nakia", "hero", "world"], "polarity": 0.01912185610532719, "subjectivity": 0.40012611355586547},

Brunell has worked with Republicans in support of their gerrymandering efforts and believes that the census overrepresents black Americans.\n\nIn fact, Brunell wrote a book advocating the use of gerrymandering, Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America, published in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Newsweek highlights, Brunell\u2019s appointment could imperil the rights of people of color in America. The business of counting everyone who lives within America\u2019s borders\u2014who they are and where they are\u2014is essential in informing state and federal voting districts, as well as determining how to distribute local, state and federal resources. A chief concern is that Trump would weaponize the census, using it to attack voting rights and immigrants\u2014and Brunell\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 implies that he\u2019d be happy to carry out his boss\u2019s marching orders.\n\nVoting rights advocates fear how Brunell could influence the undercounting of African Americans, especially given his previous work. The professor has opposed early voting, for instance, which favors black Americans as well as working-class Americans. The GOP has also used Brunell\u2019s reports or testimony in multiple lawsuits filed against them for unfairly redrawing voting districts on political and racial lines.\n\nIn his book on gerrymandering, Brunell argued that stacking Democrats and Republicans in like-minded districts leads to better representation from elected officials because it means that fewer citizens vote for the losing candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration also wants to add a separate question about citizenship that could dramatically reduce Latinx response rates out of fear that the feds would use that data to target them. A Middle Eastern and North African, or MENA, racial category has also been proposed\u2014a move that had been advocated by many people of MENA ancestry prior to Trump\u2019s election. Given Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim and anti-Arab rhetoric, though, it\u2019s likely that they, too, would be discouraged from reporting their racial backgrounds on the 2020 census because of worries about immigration crackdowns.\n\nAs with many other Trump government picks, Brunell is spectacularly unprepared to serve as the top operational official at the Census Bureau. He has no administrative experience and little experience with federal statistics\u2014both essential elements of the job. As Politico notes, the role typically goes to a nonpolitical career civil servant with a background in statistics. Meanwhile, Brunell\u2014gerrymandering\u2019s No. 1 fan\u2014is a registered Republican.\n\n\n\nBrunell\u2019s appointment does not require congressional approval and could come as early as this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Politico and Newsweek.", "keywords": ["federal", "brunell", "pick", "overcounted", "census", "experience", "thinks", "head", "rights", "trumps", "professor", "black", "voting", "racial", "trump", "progerrymandering"], "polarity": 0.09086229086229088, "subjectivity": 0.406016731016731},

Everyone\u2019s fixated on the screen, and the movie\u2019s jokes may get a laugh or two, but because most everyone there is there working, it\u2019s just not the same as sitting back and just having fun.\n\n\n\nLike a lot of people across the world, I saw Marvel\u2019s Black Panther multiple times this weekend because I wanted to pore deeply over the film\u2019s narrative layers and drink in the visual richness that is Wakanda. But as I hopped around from theater to theater in New York City, something else\u2014something beautiful about the movie\u2014became clear for me: The only way to really appreciate how powerful Black Panther is is to see it in a black movie theater with a predominantly black audience.\n\nBecause of how close it is to my apartment, the AMC Magic Johnson in Harlem is where I\u2019ve ended up seeing nearly every Marvel movie for the past few years, but the atmosphere in the theater this past Friday was unlike anything I\u2019d ever experienced there before. Long before even stepping foot inside the building, you could tell who had made their way to Harlem specifically to see Black Panther and how, for many people, the night was part of a bigger cultural event. In the light of the lobby, you could see groups of women rocking gorgeously styled geles and excitedly stanning in front of larger-than-life cutouts of Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye in her Wakandan finest.\n\nKids in panther masks weaved their way in and out of the ridiculously long line of people waiting to scan their tickets, and even though the place was hectic, you could feel just how pumped everyone was\u2014not just for the movie itself but also to be celebrating something like Black Panther in a distinctly black space.\n\nNo two audiences react to a film the exact same way, but what was enlivening about sitting in a theater full of black families and friends was the way everyone was able to fall into different rhythms with the movie while watching it together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments like T\u2019Challa\u2019s fight against M\u2019Baku atop Warrior Falls drew everyone together in support of the royal family, but you could sense a distinct divide grow in the audience as Erik Killmonger argued his case for an expansionist Wakanda. Every time the camera trained its focus on Michael B. Jordan (especially while he was shirtless), someone made a point of reminding everyone just what a vision he is to look at. But just moments later, someone on the opposite side of the theater never missed a chance to (lovingly) tut and suck their teeth in disapproval of Killmonger\u2019s extremism. Just as Black Panther was engaged in a very specific kind of dialogue with the audience, we were engaging with one another in real time\u2014a call-and-response of sorts about the story developing before our eyes.\n\nThere were more than a few scenes\u2014usually after one of Shuri\u2019s flawless zingers\u2014where the entire theater erupted into laughter that drowned out a few seconds of dialogue that no one could hear. In those moments, it didn\u2019t feel as if anyone was missing out on the movie but, rather, that as a collective, we all slipped into a comfortable familiarity with and understanding of one another that was more important than the specifics of the plot.\n\nBlack Panther\u2019s online hype is a force to be reckoned with, but it doesn\u2019t quite capture how profoundly moving it is to see rows full of little black girls and boys staring up in wonder at the Dora Milaje while they\u2019re kicking ass and taking names. They saw themselves on-screen in Black Panther\u2019s heroes and its villains, and I saw myself in them\u2014young and vibrant and inspired by the very idea of futuristic, distinctly African blackness destined to save the world from itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this was exactly the case at the screening on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side that I attended later in the weekend. The lines were just as long and the excitement was still palpable, but the sense of togetherness and kinship was missing. There were no families posing in front of the Black Panther cardboard stand-ups with their arms proudly crossed in X\u2019s over their chests, or carefully placed kente cloth accents as part of people\u2019s ensembles. I enjoyed the movie all the same, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling as if something important was missing from the experience, and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s something the theater could have replicated even if it wanted to.\n\nWakanda itself may not be a real place, but the magic and wonder that Black Panther presents to us is. It\u2019s the magic and wonder that all black people know we\u2019re more than capable of creating in the world when we come together and rally behind a cause, and it\u2019s something that can never be celebrated enough. That power and sense of connectedness is the narrative foundation upon which Black Panther is built, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s best experienced in the company of other black people.", "keywords": ["movie", "theater", "panther", "wonder", "sense", "missing", "black", "understand", "world", "way", "really", "saw"], "polarity": 0.14005586164677084, "subjectivity": 0.46970079583715924},

The letters, which come from the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, have also found the prestigious university to be \u201cout of compliance\u201d with federal law.\n\nThe Justice Department is also threatening to sue Harvard if the school doesn\u2019t hand over documents it has asked for by Dec. 1. Harvard has said that it has complied to the best of its ability but cannot compromise confidential and sensitive student records for the sake of the DOJ\u2019s hunt.\n\nThe new documents confirm earlier reports that the DOJ was actively investigating complaints lodged against Harvard University by Asian-American applicants who claim that they were denied admissions based on their race. The suit alleges that Harvard uses a quota system\u2014a practice that has been ruled illegal\u2014to keep the number of Asian-American students relatively static year after year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conservative legal strategist behind the suit, Edward Blum, has had his sights set on blowing up a series of key civil-rights-era laws. Blum, who is not an attorney, successfully challenged the Voting Rights Act, though he lost last year\u2019s Supreme Court challenge to affirmative action against the University of Texas.\n\nNow it appears that the DOJ wants to take the suit, and the resentment of a handful of Asian and Asian-American college applicants, and dismantle affirmative action as we know it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVanita Gupta, who led the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration (before the department felt like some terrible play at irony), told CNN that Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u201cclearly appears to be on the hunt for a case to bring a significant challenge to affirmative action.\u201d\n\nThe original suit, as well as the DOJ\u2019s obsession with Harvard\u2019s admissions practices, ignores several important factors. If Asian Americans suffered disproportionately, it would also mean that less worthy white applicants also benefited\u2014a fact that doesn\u2019t square with anti-affirmative-action rhetoric that focuses almost exclusively on black and Latinx students.\n\nAsians and Asian Americans are also disproportionately represented in Harvard\u2019s student body in comparison with their national numbers: Harvard\u2019s Class of 2021 is 22.2 percent Asian and Asian American\u2014the highest percentage ever for that group (African Americans make up 14.6 percent), according to the Mercury News. Asians make up 5.6 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore important, buying into the belief that Asian-American students disproportionately suffer because of their race implies that admissions applications between students are one-to-one comparisons. Simply switch an applicant\u2019s race, and suddenly the result changes! That view ignores how complex the admissions process has become, hinging on a variety of scores, qualifications, requirements and factors.\n\nLast year\u2019s Supreme Court decision alluded to this in the high court\u2019s defense of allowing race to factor into admissions decisions; it is but one of many qualities that colleges take into consideration when reviewing which students would be the best fit for their school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent report from The Atlantic highlighted this complexity. The city or town from which a student hails, his or her record of service, and whether the candidate is a first-generation college student or descends from a legacy of alumni all contribute to admissions decisions, yet there is little to no legal hand-wringing about how these factors come into play.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that recent studies indicate that Asians Americans, as a whole, have benefited from and support affirmative action programs. This isn\u2019t about protecting a certain group of students\u2014it\u2019s about using Asians as a cover to resurrect a white supremacist policy.\n\nAs this excellent NPR piece points out, white Americans have long used this myth of the \u201cmodel minority\u201d as a wedge to keep Asians and other people of color from seeking broader alignment and cooperation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs these documents indicate, the DOJ is ready to turn this wedge into a hammer.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["americans", "suit", "students", "asian", "affirmative", "threatens", "student", "racebased", "justice", "practices", "harvards", "documents", "department", "sue", "race", "harvard", "admissions"], "polarity": 0.16241018931317433, "subjectivity": 0.4479196549718937},

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over.

This year, the animated bag of Botox and plastic-surgeon silicone known as Kim Kardashian decided that she would have multiple costumes, all based on her favorite musicians.\n\nSeems fine, right? Everyone thought she looked cute when she came out dressed as Cher, although, to be fair, 94 percent of Black Twitter didn\u2019t know Cher actually made music.

When 21-year-old white girls wear feather headdresses to a concert, that is appropriating Native American culture. When white boys wear blackface to their frat party, it is appropriating black culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not those.\n\nKim is, however, guilty of the lesser charge known as a lane violation. What pissed off Black Twitter is the Kardashian family\u2019s lack of awareness as to answering the most important question pertinent in all of this:\n\n\u201cWhy, though?\u201d\n\nIf you wanted to pay homage to your musical icons, why not choose someone besides Aaliyah? There are 938,488,847,474,202 white people who have ever lived (I counted). I\u2019m sure at least three or four of them made somewhat decent music.

But it also proves that you selectively chose who you wanted to be. Why didn\u2019t you dress up as Prince Markie Dee from the Fat Boys, then? He\u2019s a musical legend, too.\n\nSo, no, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t guilty of cultural appropriation this time, so y\u2019all can chill. Or not.

She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u2018don\u2019t look good on you\u2019 or \u2018you can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u2019 I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u2018she doesn\u2019t work very hard, because she doesn\u2019t have to\u2019\u2014[it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Jackie is no stranger to hard work. She says \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, that want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she says. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say \u2018You\u2019re too pretty, how could you be in the army? Whatever that means\u201d\n\nJackie Aina/YouTube\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Jackie seems to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable. \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s okay to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounts in her voice as she tells me she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative, we are multi-faceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable, people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She points to prejudices surrounding beauty like the now-defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive/unattractive a woman really is. Aina says:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up.

In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d Aina explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not only just a black beauty blogger.

The protection is given to countries that have experienced political or environmental catastrophe such as armed conflict or natural disaster.\n\n\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it will terminate temporary protections for Haiti beginning Jan. 1, 2018, followed by an 18-month grace period. That means that nearly 60,000 Haitians will have until July 22, 2019, to leave the country they call home.\n\n\u201cThis is criminal,\u201d says Farah Larrieux of Miami. Larrieux came to the U.S. in 2005 and qualified for TPS in 2010. She says the decision by DHS to terminate TPS puts thousands at risk of losing everything they\u2019ve worked for and could separate families.\n\nHaiti was granted temporary protection after a catastrophic earthquake in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people and demolished most of the country\u2019s infrastructure. As part of TPS, Haitian immigrants are eligible to stay in the U.S., obtain work permits and send remittances to assist in Haiti\u2019s redevelopment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe program does not offer a pathway to citizenship or permanent residency.\n\n\u201cThis is a issue of human rights,\u201d says Marleine Bastien, a social worker and executive director of Haitian Women of Miami, a community organization that advocates for South Florida\u2019s Haitian community\u2014the largest in the country. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about removing people and sending them into conditions that may put their lives in danger.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said, \u201cSignificant steps have been taken to improve the stability and quality of life for Haitian citizens, and Haiti is able to safely receive traditional levels of returned citizens.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarrieux disagrees. \u201cHaiti is still suffering from a cholera outbreak and deadly hurricanes that struck in the years since. Plus, there\u2019s still political violence,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to send people with little or no connection to Haiti anymore back to the same dangerous conditions they were escaping from.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany TPS holders already have deep roots in their U.S. communities and play prominent roles as business owners, health care providers and service workers. According to the Journal on Migration and Human Security, there are more than 30,000 Haitian TPS recipients living in the country, primarily in South Florida. They are also parents to nearly 20,000 U.S.-born children.\n\nSeventy percent of Haitian TPS holders are employed, and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (pdf) estimates that losing their work authorization could result in a nearly $7 billion reduction (pdf) in Social Security and Medicare contributions over a decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe must protect our Haitian neighbors and friends because they are vital members of our communities and play an important part in our economies, especially in places like the Miami area in Florida and as I\u2019ve experienced with my constituents in Brooklyn\u2019s 9th District,\u201d Democratic Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York said in a phone interview prior to Homeland Security\u2019s announcement.\n\nAfter the announcement, Clarke called the administration\u2019s decision \u201ccruel and unconscionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did moral decency and compassion for others become a partisan issue?\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Clarke\u2014along with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)\u2014introduced bipartisan legislation, the ASPIRE-TPS Act of 2017 (pdf), which would permanently resolve the status of the nearly 300,000 TPS recipients from Haiti, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central America. With the bill\u2019s passage, recipients who\u2019ve been in the country at least five years would be eligible to apply for permanent residency under a new protected status.\n\n\n\nHaiti and Central American nations like Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras are some of this hemisphere\u2019s most economically depressed, politically unstable and violent countries. These nations also share unique histories of U.S. involvement in their political and socioeconomic development that Bastien says cannot be ignored. The U.S. occupied Haiti between 1915 and 1934 and has played substantial military and financial roles in previous dictatorships and coups d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot try to limit migration without taking responsibility for creating conditions that force people from their homelands in the first place. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d \u2014Marleine Bastien, executive director of haitian women of miami\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government aligned itself with a bourgeoisie that continues to exploit Haitians,\u201d she says. \u201cYou cannot try to limit migration without taking responsibility for creating conditions that force people from their homelands in the first place. You can\u2019t have it both ways. \u201d\n\nBastien says that\u2019s why many Haitian TPS holders are those who migrated even before the earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010. Some recipients fled violence and political instability years before. Bastien says that many of her clients have been in the country for decades and have American-born children.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRony Ponthieux is one of them. A nurse practitioner living in Miami Gardens, he and his wife qualified for TPS after coming to the U.S. in 1999 following an unsuccessful attempt to seek asylum. He says Haitians are the engine that keeps a lot of communities, especially underprivileged minority areas, running.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are living the American dream,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have houses, jobs, are providing for our families and sending money home to help our homelands rebuild. I don\u2019t understand how we can be deported when we are doing nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nThe pressure is on for Congress to reach a deal on legislation before the July 22, 2019, cutoff. For now, the most immediate fear for the thousands of Haitian immigrants is figuring out what happens next. Ponthieux fears returning to a country so dangerous it required him to flee, and he is faced with either becoming undocumented, moving to Canada, or uprooting his young daughter and teenage son\u2014both American citizens\u2014to a country they\u2019ve never known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have never been to Haiti and don\u2019t know Haiti except for what they see on TV.

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

Now, I happen to like it. It was well-acted and moving and is probably the second-best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie; people like different kinds of movies. just as they like different kinds of ice cream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose-intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery, complain that they didn\u2019t have a nondairy version of butter-cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand-word think piece on how the ice cream-industrial complex is misleading black folks.\n\nYet, like clockwork, late-night college-dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying that Erik Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t those.\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first: Killmonger wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI know that people are having #ExpressYourUnpopularOpinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it; folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot takes on one of the most successful superhero films of all time to get clicks on their SoundCloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean that any of the critiques are right\u2014and most aren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as king of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world.\n\nSome people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt that the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading?\n\nKillmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas. They didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were\u2014again\u2014ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns; it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas.\n\nWeapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Ku Klux Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people, no matter how many vibranium-shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson, Mo.\n\nNow, if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on vibranium, I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a PowerPoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is, though, Killmonger didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More important, Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because film director Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution; it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily. What do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide-scale revolution can occur to you only if you didn\u2019t watch the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandans are part of a never colonized, ethnocentric, isolationist, theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years, and that was like a 15-minute Hoverbike trip from Panther Palace.\n\nHow would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to Pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip?\n\nKillmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge. W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism, and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics felt the need to center him in the movie, and it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop-culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross is in Wakanda is that he took a bullet for the girl the king is sweating. Notice that the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that, they called Ross \u201ccolonizer,\u201d locked him in a room, and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger, Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time on or gave too much focus to Ross, you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the Transportation Security Administration, aka the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u201clook\u201d revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies, even though Magneto is right every. single. time., he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained, despite being a former slave himself, Django cares nothing about freeing others; all he wants is to get his wife back.\n\nIn other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is OK if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther. The movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution; it\u2019s about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to one another, wrapped up in a coup and a bunch of computer-generated images and fancy costumes.\n\nKillmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and ahistorical. Let\u2019s save the concern-trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie; those movies are much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["killmonger", "movie", "ross", "panther", "yall", "movies", "revolution", "black", "think", "revolutionary", "know", "wrong", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.025088763575605678, "subjectivity": 0.44868072960178224},

It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award. The current university president apologized, asked me to crown the new homecoming queen and to join the advisory board.\n\nDaphne Maxwell is crowned homecoming queen of Northwestern University in 1967.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite.

Kennedy was an explosive FBI report about civil rights leader and icon Martin Luther King Jr. Even though the report had nothing to do with the JFK assassination, the Trump administration included the newly unsealed dossier in a trove of documents released Friday related to the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of Kennedy in Dallas.\n\nWhat is the document?\n\nCommissioned by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the 20-page report is titled \u201cMartin Luther King, Jr.: A Current Analysis\u201d (pdf). It is dated March 12, 1968\u2014curiously, less than a month before King was shot and killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is in the report?\n\nLies.\n\nThe report is rife with falsehoods, speculation and disproven allegations about King, including his ties to communism and stories about secret orgies with prostitutes and white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did they think King was a communist?\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nYou know how today\u2019s incarnation of suspicious, fragile white-power brokers now label every anti-establishment organization a \u201cterrorist group\u201d? Well, in the 1950s and 1960s, the term \u201ccommunism\u201d shrank the collective Caucasian anus and furrowed white brows with fear, so every group of people who dared to speak truth to power was saddled with the label \u201cMarxist\u201d or \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, the report ties King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the Communist Party USA, a small, marginalized group with no influence by 1960. The details of the document allege that King and the SCLC were heavily influenced by Stanley Levinson, a lawyer and businessman who financed the party for years.\n\nThe dossier tries to tie King to the Communist Party through Levinson even though Levinson had left the party years before he met King. It insists that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was related to a secret communist agenda without offering any solid evidence.\n\nWas King a communist?\n\nDidn\u2019t I just say the report was filled with lies? Are you even paying attention?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of explaining it to you, I\u2019ll just tell you what King told his trusted adviser Bayard Rustin in 1965 as King was crafting a statement announcing the unity of the civil rights organizations:\n\nThere are things I wanted to say renouncing communism in theory, but they would not go along with it. We wanted to say that it was an alien philosophy contrary to us, but they wouldn\u2019t go along with it.\n\nPart of the FBI\u2019s allegations of communism is fueled by King\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, which some translated as support for the commuinist Viet Cong. Some of it is tied to the fact that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was seen by some melanin-impaired capitalists as un-American. King\u2019s strategy of peaceful resistance is also closely affiliated with Karl Marx\u2019s belief in the possibility of achieving equality through peaceful revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that there were communists affiliated with the civil rights movement. Some of them were prominent supporters, but that does not mean that King or the entire movement for equality was a communist plot.\n\nSome of the people reading this article hold unspeakably heinous beliefs, like putting sugar on grits. This publication even employs people who commit un-American acts like giving trick-or-treaters candy corn for Halloween or putting ketchup in the refrigerator. Corey Townsend, The Root\u2019s social media editor, even confessed that he likes pumpkin-spice-related foods.\n\nBut none of these terrible acts means that everyone here at The Root is an evil, demented terrorist of taste buds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about the sex orgies?\n\nJust say \u201corgies\u201d; the \u201csex\u201d part is understood. There aren\u2019t any other kinds of orgies, although I have joined friends at a certain Atlanta restaurant for what can only be described as a \u201clemon-pepper-wing orgy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysis from the FBI, King\u2019s associates held a workshop in 1968 in Miami to train a minister. The report states that some in attendance were disgusted with the whiskey drinking, homosexuality and fornication at the conference, including a sex show with prostitutes who engaged in activities \u201cdeviating from the normal sex acts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report does not say that King was present at this event but details affairs by King, including one with singer Joan Baez and an alleged love child with the wife of a prominent Los Angeles dentist. The single source for this information is a \u201cresponsible\u201d informant \u201cin a position to know.\u201d\n\nWhy does any of this matter?\n\nAgain, because ... white people.\n\nNone of this salacious detail negates the fact that King was fighting for the freedom or equality of black people. It does not dismiss the reality of Jim Crow, segregation, voter suppression, unequal housing, inferior education, state-sponsored terrorism or the unconstitutional, government-backed treatment of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reasonable explanation for any of this is that it was an attempt to discredit MLK and, by proxy, the entire civil rights movement.\n\nHow did they use this information?\n\nHoover and the FBI used it in a number of ways. The FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, tried to destroy the civil rights movement for years by casting it as a subversive, communist-backed agenda. The details in this report were ammunition for much of that FBI agenda. In November 1964, the FBI sent a letter to King telling him that it was aware of his extramarital affairs. The bureau threatened to release this information if King didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank God J. Edgar Hoover is gone. Today\u2019s FBI would never do this again, right?\n\nCould you do me a favor and hold my lemon-pepper wing while I double over in laughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general who controls the FBI, is known for calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d A few months after he took office, an FBI report leaked that characterized the threat from \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d as the new terrorist threat. Even the nonviolent group Black Lives Matter is often called a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d by members on the conservative side of the aisle.\n\nIf you believe that the day has passed when anyone concerned with justice or equality could be painted by right-wing zealots as evil, anti-American villains, just remember to turn on your television around 1 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon and watch the Caucasian crowd members boo NFL players for kneeling quietly during the national anthem, or read one of the many right-wing rags\u2019 desperate attempts to tie former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI dossier proves that Martin Luther King Jr. was the victim of a coordinated, government-funded effort to suppress the civil rights movement. President Donald Trump\u2019s release of the documents provides additional fuel for those who seek to denigrate anything black and outspoken because their history of complicity gives them the heebie-jeebies. Because they are too willing to believe that a civil rights legend was a communist and sexual deviant, but not that their dear, pumpkin-colored, pussy-grabbing president is a sexual assaulter. Because that would mean that they were on the wrong side of history for more than a quadruple century.\n\n\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["kings", "released", "martin", "wanted", "jr", "report", "fbi", "white", "say", "communist", "luther", "king", "civil", "liefilled", "black", "know", "trump", "file", "rights"], "polarity": -0.02562157287157288, "subjectivity": 0.4564069264069264},

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

There were thriving and ideologically diverse cities surrounded by expansive and bucolic countrysides. There was modern technology perfectly weaved into cultural tradition, a melding that was symbiotic instead of antagonistic. And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects. Also, we\u2019re a little short on vibranium.\n\nOne thing, however, that we can and definitely should start doing is what M\u2019Baku and his Que Dog Jabari tribe did when encountering a problematic white dude who was speaking when there was no ask or need or purpose for the thoughts and opinions of problematic white dudes.\n\nBark.\n\nNot a purposeless bark. This isn\u2019t a shih tzu barking through the window at a squirrel. Instead, this would be an intentional bark. A targeted bark. An overpowering bark. A drowning bark. A Wakandan bark. A bark meant to communicate, \u201cUm, who told you that you can speak? When it is time for your words, we will let you know. And maybe that time will never come. We\u2019ll see. Now, just shut up and stand there. Maybe get on your phone and Google \u2018How not to be a colonizer.\u2019 Whatever you do, I want to hear you not speaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bark doesn\u2019t just have to be a counter for useless words, either.

A purse is clutched when you walk on an elevator? WOOF! WOOF! WOOF! (If they\u2019re going to act scared, you might as well give them a reason to be.)\n\nOf course, this barking will take some practice. They can\u2019t be small-dog barks, so people with higher and/or softer voices will probably have to do some training. Which is why, today, I\u2019m announcing the opening of the M\u2019Baku School of Wakandan White Silencing. The classes will be free, so no worries about me using GoFundMe monies for Bigen and creatine.\n\n\n\n(Sidenote: Also, the bark was actually an ape grunt.

During a meeting between the two Republicans, Minor began asking Harold questions about her sexuality and her marital status, asking \u201cAre you a lesbo?\u201d multiple times. The conversation reportedly turned heated when Minor \u201cused the full n-word.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to state Republicans, Illinois House leader Peter Breen wrote that Minor confirmed the details of the conversation and his use of the slurs to Breen. To be fair, Breen says that Minor claims he had a good reason:\n\n\u201cAt an in-person meeting that Mr. Minor requested with me, with a witness present, Mr. Minor confirmed that he had asked Ms. Harold if she was a lesbian and that he had used the full n-word in her and her assistant\u2019s presence. He explained this away by claiming that Ms. Harold \u201cwanted him to ask the question\u201d about her sexual orientation and claiming that Ms. Harold asked him to say the full n-word. Suffice it to say, this is not how the other participants to the meeting heard or understood the statements, nor how they reported those statements to others both immediately after the meeting occurred and consistently in the months since.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitico confirmed the conversation with multiple sources, saying that Minor asked the questions so he could \u201cget it on the record,\u201d and while Minor would not comment to Politico, he earlier insisted that he did not use the \u201cfull n-word\u201d because he and Erika are friends.\n\nWhich brings up a great point:\n\nWhat the hell is \u201cthe full n-word?\u201d It is repeatedly mentioned by the people in this controversy, but I have no idea what it is. Did the town chairman simply emphasize the \u201cr\u201d at the end of the word or it possible that there is a longer, more detestable version of \u201cnigger\u201d that white people have been keeping secret for all these years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Burt Minor call Erika Harold a \u201cniggerilla?\u201d\n\nIllinois Republicans are now rescinding their endorsements from Minor because, while Republicans have no problems with passing racist, homophobic legislation and injecting it into their political agenda, they can\u2019t have a party member walking around using the full n-word.\n\nWhich brings up a greater point:\n\nIf you\u2019re a black Republican, shouldn\u2019t you expect to be called the n-word? It\u2019s like hiring Bill Cosby to bartend at a slumber party or asking R. Kelly to chaperone a junior high school dance\u2014you know what\u2019s going to happen.

There will always be new news. But sometimes, there just aren't many new stories that move the needle. And sometimes the stories that move the needle don't have much of a connection to the Black community.\n\nStill, there are a few topics I can always count on; people (President Obama, Eric Holder, etc), places (Chicago, Ferguson, etc), and issues (police brutality, racism, etc) I search for specifically on those difficult days because I know they're always creating news.\n\nAnd, since April of 2014, Boko Haram has been one of those topics.\n\nI'm sure many of you were aware of Boko Haram before their abduction of 276 school-aged girls last year and the resulting #bringbackourgirls campaign.

Islamist militants sprayed bullets as they stormed in last weekend in trucks and armored vehicles, local authorities said Friday. When they arrived, they unloaded motorcycles and pursued residents who fled into the bush, firing indiscriminately, said Baba Abba Hassan, a local district head.\n\nFrom Slate: Boko Haram Reaches New Low: Uses 10-Year-Old Girl as Suicide Bomber\n\n\n\nBoko Haram has already used women as suicide bombers in the past but children had been largely off limits. Although not entirely. In June of last year, which marked the first time Boko Haram used a female suicide bomber, a 10-year-old girl was found wearing a suicide vest, according to AFP. But this latest attack appears to be the first one that was successful. Officials say it\u2019s likely the girl had no idea what was going on and that the bomb was detonated remotely. \"The girl was about 10 years old and I doubt if she actually knew what was strapped to her body,\" one witness tells AFP. The bomb apparently went off as the girl was being searched to enter a crowded market in Maiduguri and her small body was torn in two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won't pretend to have any ideas to even begin to attempt to remedy what they're doing.

The Trump administration decided Friday that, effective immediately, any employer can claim a religious or moral objection to providing birth control coverage under its insurance plan.\n\nThe Obamacare mandate that requires birth control to be provided at no cost has been opposed by religious groups and fought in court for more than five years, as Politico notes.\n\nThe administration has published a 100-page document (pdf) in which it writes:\n\nThe United States has a long history of providing conscience protections in the regulation of health care for entities and individuals with objections based on religious beliefs or moral convictions. These interim final rules expand exemptions to protect moral convictions for certain entities and individuals whose health plans are subject to a mandate of contraceptive coverage through guidance issued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe document notes that the new Trump mandate will not affect other federal programs that \u201cprovide free or subsidized contraceptives for women at risk of unintended pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe administration claims to be protecting people from being forced to violate their religious beliefs, while simultaneously ignoring and downplaying the fact that this will now make it harder for many women to get access to birth control.\n\nPolitico reports that women\u2019s groups are already moving to counter this change with lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told Politico:\n\nToday\u2019s outrageous rules by the Trump Administration show callous disregard for women\u2019s rights, health, and autonomy.

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over.

The FBI report was released on Aug. 3\u2014just nine days before a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign Policy obtained the report, which is marked for official use only. The document warns that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d pose a growing threat to law enforcement. In a particularly cruel and unfounded assertion, the FBI claims that police attacks on black Americans could spur \u201cpremeditated, retaliatory lethal violence\u201d against the police.\n\nFrom Foreign Policy:\n\nThe August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was the catalyst for widespread anger and violence, the FBI report says, concluding that continued \u201calleged\u201d police abuses have fueled more violence.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight. Because the response to Michael Brown\u2019s death was the first instance of black people voicing outrage about police brutality.\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t specifically call out Black Lives Matter, the group certainly is the subtext of the document. As Foreign Policy rightly notes, 168 black Americans have been shot and killed by the police in 2017 alone. Law enforcement has killed 748 people in all this year so far.\n\nThat\u2019s 748 lives in less than 10 months, nearly a quarter of them black.\n\nMeanwhile, the report lists six total acts of premeditated violence against officers, including the shooting death of Dallas police officers at a BLM rally in July 2016. The shooter, Micah Johnson, wasn\u2019t affiliated with BLM but was reportedly \u201cinfluenced by BIE ideology,\u201d based on his journals and statements to police, according to the FBI report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move is the latest iteration of a long tradition of the FBI targeting and tracking black activists. The most famous example is COINTELPRO, which was created in 1956 with the explicit intent to \u201cexpose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of black nationalist[s],\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s own documents. Then, as now, the people the feds are actually targeting were mostly activists fighting to advance racial equality.\n\n\n\nOr, at the very least, stop the government from ceaselessly, and with impunity, killing black people and people of color.\n\nEarlier this year, The Intercept reported that the FBI began investigating white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement in 2015. That classified document was crafted, notably, under the Obama administration, and warned of white supremacists\u2019 \u201chistorical\u201d interest in \u201cinfiltrating law enforcement communities or recruiting law enforcement personnel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI did release a report earlier this year that warned that the white supremacist movement \u201clikely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year.\u201d However, the new guidance on \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d draws a dangerous equivocation between a movement that is seeing a visible resurgence and one that seems completely conjured by the FBI.\n\nAccording to Foreign Policy, this new guidance has raised eyebrows among the intelligence community, with one former official expressing shock at the report\u2019s contents.\n\n\u201cThis is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,\u201d the former official told FP. \u201cThere are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Foreign Policy.", "keywords": ["fbi", "launches", "white", "report", "20", "enforcement", "movement", "cointelpro", "targeting", "law", "policy", "extremists", "black", "violence", "foreign", "identity"], "polarity": -0.032507111935683376, "subjectivity": 0.4133005565862708},

From her nauseating Stepin Fetchit, wiggerish blackspeak to her hair, fingernails and lyrics being indistinguishable from a post-chocolate-milkshake and Taco Bell-chalupa diarrhea fart, everything about this is despicable.\n\nI could describe the video in detail, but that is not the point. It is not about the song, the video or even Danielle Bitcholi. It is about much more than this. It is about the reduction of a people into tomfoolery and ghetto tropes. It is about swallowing our culture, shitting out the undigestible parts, pointing at the turds and saying, \u201cLook what I ate.

While waiting to prepurchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity for queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut in which Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you Google the words \u201cBlack Panther queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all-too-familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And, of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multimillion-dollar box-office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... no salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo then I thought, \u201cWow, Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer person of color to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye to eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them hypocrites; it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda.\n\nWritten by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d\n\nAfter all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it; you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an Interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: If there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966, and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full-course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this, it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big-screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["movie", "representation", "dont", "panther", "emotions", "women", "queer", "black", "play", "think", "ayo", "okoye", "scene"], "polarity": 0.11899707996406107, "subjectivity": 0.4967954477388439},

High School employee is facing the music after he was recorded on cellphone video playing a game of hangman that used the n-word.\n\nAs the Kokomo Tribune reports, the eight-second video shows a student and Greg Ostapa, a paraprofessional at the high school, playing the easily recognized game on a tablet. The tablet shows that the word \u201cnigger\u201d is almost spelled out. The student is seen smiling as the video is recorded, because of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes this case even more interesting is that the student who posted the video on Twitter, and caused it to blow up, was the one who was suspended from the school.\n\nSiciley Cannon said that at first she shared the video on Snapchat, with several people capturing it. Some of those individuals shared it with administrators, and by Wednesday, she says, she was called in to the office to discuss the video.\n\nShe was then informed that there was a handbook policy stating that students cannot film other students or staff without their consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did not think I was going to get in trouble,\u201d Cannon told the news site. \u201cI would have never thought, \u2018I\u2019m about to get in trouble for this.\u2019\u201d\n\nCannon said that Ostapa made it appear that it was OK for the student to write out the offensive slur, adding that he laughed it off.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen he saw that I didn\u2019t think it was funny, he hurried up and tried to erase it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t make it seem like what he was doing was wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a petition going around demanding that Cannon\u2019s suspension be lifted and expunged from her permanent record. That petition on Change.org has collected more than 600 signatures.\n\nThe Kokomo School Corp. told the Tribune that Cannon was disciplined because she violated the school handbook\u2019s policy. There is no word as to what form of discipline the student involved in the game may face, although the Kokomo School Corp. said that the student had been disciplined according to school guidelines. In addition, the paraprofessional is facing losing his job.\n\nHowever, some say that the school needs to come out with a stronger stance against such acts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey did say the matter has been taken care of,\u201d Tessa Vaughan, the parent of one of the students who started the petition on Cannon\u2019s behalf, told the news site. \u201cBut I did tell them that\u2019s not enough. The students are very upset about it. ... They need to send a strong message.\n\n\u201cThis was a grossly racist act, and it creates a threatening environment for the students, and they need to state that they have zero tolerance for this,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is an opportunity for the school to send a positive message to the students in the community. I just hope they take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nKokomo High School Principal Angela Blessing insisted, \u201cDiscrimination in any form in unconscionable and will not be tolerated at Kokomo High School. I am proud of our students and staff who work to create an inclusive and welcoming school environment at KHS.

A new report from BuzzFeed News confirms that the Department of Justice is investigating Harvard University\u2019s admissions practices. The investigation likely centers on allegations that Harvard\u2019s use of affirmative action discriminates against students of Asian descent, according to the report.\n\nBuzzFeed reports that the confirmation is based on Freedom of Information Act requests sent to the DOJ \u201cseeking records about investigations into admissions practices\u201d at two universities: Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While the Justice Department maintained that there were no relevant records related to UNC, the department told BuzzFeed that it could not disclose any Harvard documents because they were being \u201ccompiled for law-enforcement purposes,\u201d making them exempt from the FOIA request.\n\nWhen contacted about the response letter, the DOJ confirmed that there is an \u201cactive\u201d investigation at Harvard.\n\nThe confirmation signals that the Trump administration will forge ahead in its plans to dismantle affirmative action by claiming it hurts another minority group: Asian Americans. The news comes nearly two months after an internal Justice Department document was released indicating that resources in its Civil Rights Division would be redirected toward investigating and suing universities over their affirmative action policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harvard investigation centers on a single complaint filed by 64 Asian-American groups in 2014 that claimed the prestigious Ivy League university discriminated against Asian-American applicants. The suit alleges that Harvard uses a quota system\u2014a practice that has been ruled illegal\u2014to keep the number of Asian-American students static year after year.\n\nBut at the center of the suit is a man who has had his eyes set on dismantling key civil-rights-era legislation: Edward Blum. The conservative attorney successfully challenged the Voting Rights Act, with the Supreme Court effectively gutting the landmark legislation in 2013. Blum also challenged the University of Texas\u2019 race-based admissions policies as being discriminatory against white students. The Supreme Court last year ruled against Blum and upheld the use of race in admissions decisions.\n\nNow Blum hopes to use Asian Americans as a wedge to dismantle policies that have broadly benefited people of color. In fact, data shows that the Asian-American community may actually support affirmative action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsian Americans Advancing Justice, a civil rights group, polled Asian-American voters last year and found that 64 percent supported affirmative action programs \u201cdesigned to help blacks, women and other minorities get better access to higher education,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nNicole Gon Ochi, an attorney for the group, pointed out to the Los Angeles Times that Asian Americans are not a monolith, and that affirmative action programs have been particularly helpful for \u201ctraditionally disadvantaged\u201d populations, like Southeast Asian and low-income Asian students.\n\nAnd a HuffPost article published earlier this year points out that data consistently shows that white students are frequently held to lower standards than their Asian-American peers in the college admissions process. Instead of focusing on this disparity, however, groups like those that launched the 2014 Harvard complaint have blamed black and Latinx applicants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Kim Forde-Mazrui, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes on race, told the Los Angeles Times in August, the Trump administration\u2019s feigned interest in protecting Asian Americans is politically opportunistic.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily about conservative leaders protecting the privilege of access to society\u2019s resources and opportunities for certain white constituents,\u201d Forde-Mazrui said, noting that white conservatives don\u2019t care about anti-Asian discrimination in other spaces.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see many of them concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans in other contexts, such as the \u2018bamboo ceiling\u2019 in corporate America, where such discrimination does not harm white interests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at BuzzFeed.", "keywords": ["americans", "asianamerican", "students", "white", "report", "justice", "university", "action", "department", "hit", "affirmative", "asian", "harvard", "admissions", "probe"], "polarity": 0.1296027976998126, "subjectivity": 0.3660859662725334},

Maybe one day in the near future we will have a complete listing of the different kinds of Beckys, but for today, you should just know that according to the National Academy of White Women Arts and Sciences, Taylor Swift is rated as a Class C Becky, which is a midlevel ranking that corresponds to her milquetoast, passive-aggressive whiteness.\n\n\n\nFor comparison, if Swift were a drink, she\u2019d be a room temperature Mr. Pibb. If Swift were a dance, she\u2019d be the two-step. If Swift were sex, she\u2019d be a dude with his T-shirt and socks on fucking in the missionary position while the woman has her eyes closed with her hands on his chest to stop him from \u201cgoing too crazy.\u201d\n\nBut for all her alabaster averageness, Swift sits in the Beckydom somewhere between Megyn Kelly and the white woman at your job who secretly complained to HR when you wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt on casual Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, Taylor Swift released the first single from her expected-to-be-a-hit album Reputation. Although no one has heard it, it is expected to be another compilation of angst-filled songs calling out her ex-boyfriends, and tunes waxing rhapsodic about how hard it is for a young, blond, millionaire white woman to get ahead in the world.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The album will be released on Nov. 10, which is (probably not) coincidentally 10 years after of the death of nemesis Kanye West\u2019s mother, Donda, to the exact day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you recall, Kanye and Taylor have a long history that dates back to Kanye interrupting Swift at the 2009 MTV Music Awards when she won Best Female Video over Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d I\u2019d like to point out that no one even remembers which song Swift won the award for, while \u201cIf you like it, then you should\u2019ve put a ring on it\u201d has cemented itself in the mainstream cultural lexicon.

In the accompanying 3:32 video, she gives us Tae-Bo chic, Versailles realness, and lots and lots of vogueing, all on a white soundstage. Basically, the \u201cbeat for the gods\u201d Cox walks us through the creation of a well made-up face\u2014complete with splits and death drops.\n\nAs I write this, the hashtag #ImShowingMyAge is trending on Twitter.

Some of the stories shared through the #MeToo movement have triggered a range of emotions and questions; some may have come off as \u201cgray areas.\u201d How do we actually know when we\u2019re giving or given consent?\n\nSo glad you asked. Sexual consent is when both parties agree to have sex\u2014throughout the encounter. Let\u2019s start with the basics\u2014we\u2019ll call it \u201cConsent 101\u201d\u2014and then explore some less orthodox situations:\n\n\n\nDo I Really Need to Hear a \u201cYes\u201d?\n\nWell, yeah. You do. Hearing \u201cyes\u201d from your partner is\u2014and should be\u2014sexy as fuck. Speaking personally, nothing turns me on more than a partner who respects my wishes and wants to know my needs. When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely.

On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist.

He\u2019s a great, Zoolander-level squinter. Perhaps one of the world\u2019s all-time great squinters. He\u2019s apparently amazing at purchasing and eating KFC. It\u2019s not a game with Trump\u2019s Chicken Littles combo-eating game. When Donald Trump walks into a room, potato wedges piss their pants and get hives. And I\u2019m certain he\u2019s awesome at Jenga. Because if he can stack and erect piles of bullshit as high as he does, Jenga towers are light work.\n\nHis greatest talent, however, is dog-whistling. From \u201cMake America great again\u201d to his petty preoccupation with reversing literally everything President Barack Obama did, no one in recent memory has been better at tailoring their actions and communications to convey a very specific point to a very specific group of people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo wit, take a look at his recent tweets admonishing Marshawn Lynch and LaVar Ball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe existence of these tweets is a dog whistle in itself. A white person in power publicly admonishing uppity blacks is chum to Trump\u2019s base (and by \u201cTrump\u2019s base\u201d I mean \u201cAmerica\u201d), and these tweeting sprees are feeding sessions.\n\nThe language here matters, too\u2014specifically the idea of disrespect and the lack of proper reverence for Trump\u2019s big white benevolence. What he is saying is that these black people need to be grateful for what they have\u2014and what he\u2019s specifically given them\u2014but since they\u2019re very obviously not, they need to be reminded, publicly and vehemently, of their place and position. Basically, let\u2019s not forget\u2014and let\u2019s not allow them to forget\u2014that they\u2019re niggers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cdisrespectful black\u201d employed as a stand-in for \u201cnigger\u201d isn\u2019t new. It stretches back as far as the invention of the nigger does. The nigger was created to hierarchize and to justify subjugation. And when one of us dared step out of line or question this status, we were ungrateful niggers without the moral or intellectual acuity to recognize how appreciative we should be. Now, since \u201cnigger\u201d is no longer allowed in polite society, a reference to that damning lack of perpetual genuflection articulates that same point.\n\n\u201cThey already get so many things for free,\u201d they\u2019re wont to say, \u201cso why are they protesting and not on their knees in thanks?\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is just one of the many terms shoehorned into the American lexicon now to describe and communicate and distinguish the nigger without actually saying that word. Because of course saying that would be racist. And racism is wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know about \u201cthug,\u201d which has been such an obvious dog whistle for so long that the word itself is (rightly) seen as a slur. It officially transcended the dog whistle. Which I guess would make it a ... ghost whistle?\n\nThen there\u2019s any out-of-context reference to Chicago, which is such an absurd \u201cnigger\u201d stand-in when you remember that it\u2019s a fucking city. A city where whites are still the largest racial demographic. Chicago as a nigger stand-in is like, I don\u2019t know, if white people started calling us \u201cKia Cadenzas.\u201d\n\nBut as odd as Chicago is, I\u2019m not quite sure if it beats the surreality of allusions to the government. The federal government particularly. I forgot exactly where I first read or heard it, but along with the fact that many whites believe that we (niggers) are disproportionally supported by the government\u2014an assistance we don\u2019t deserve\u2014a not-insignificant-at-all part of the white distaste for the federal government is that so many of us (niggers) have government jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when they\u2019re pushing to limit the size and scope of Washington, D.C., and bureaucracies, they\u2019re ultimately pushing for niggers to have less (perceived) cushion and less income. Do they not realize that niggers/niggas hate the Man, too?\n\nOf course, there are more nigger stand-ins. Socialist. Muslim. In sports, undisciplined is a nigger stand-in fav. And there will continue to be more, as they\u2019ll continue to be forced to be more and more creative when some of these terms transcend the dog whistle.\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re black, don\u2019t be surprised if, the next time you happen to offend a white person, she has that \u201cI really want to say \u2018nigger\u2019\u201d look on her face, but she calls you a Kia Cadenza instead.", "keywords": ["theyre", "dog", "white", "whistle", "nigger", "nword", "saying", "disrespectful", "trumps", "things", "black", "standin", "cant", "niggers", "hes", "really", "say"], "polarity": 0.11053329346092504, "subjectivity": 0.46659750702513847},

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her.

One of Nielsen\u2019s first priorities is putting Manigault in her place.\n\nAccording to sources inside the cross-burning dumpster fire called \u201cthe Trump administration,\u201d Manigault had a habit of showing up unannounced at important meetings, sitting down and making herself comfortable. As assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison, Manigault is technically one of Orange Sherbert Stalin\u2019s numerous \u201caides,\u201d and had no business at many of those high-level meetings, but since she was unofficially Trump\u2019s Secretary in Charge of Black Shit, no one said anything.\n\nBut not anymore.\n\nSince the reality star obviously never learned the most important rule of friends with presidential benefits, the new White House let Manigault know that she can\u2019t just pop up without calling first. Nielsen sent out a \u201cStay in Your Lane\u201d memo to Trump\u2019s staff, and Manigault was the main Negress on the list. In describing her duties, the Times said of Nielsen:\n\nShe is also responsible for keeping Mr. Kelly\u2019s no-fly list of aides he deems to be unfit to attend serious meetings, the most prominent of whom is Omarosa Manigault, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d star with an ill-defined job and a penchant for dropping into meetings where she was not invited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManigault also was known for \u201ctriggering\u201d Trump by sharing negative news reports with the president. Manigault\u2019s gossip would reportedly infuriate Trump, causing him to stew about it all day. She allegedly shared MSNBC\u2019s negative coverage via his personal phone, which inspired the famously disgusting tweet about Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski\u2019s plastic surgery.\n\nNow that she has been deemed \u201cunfit\u201d to sit among the real decision-makers at the White House, the Apprentice star can presumably get back to the hard work of stepping and fetching for which she has become famous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["houses", "white", "york", "manigault", "times", "willona", "trumps", "meetings", "star", "good", "omarosa", "apparently", "administration", "house", "trump"], "polarity": 0.096601430976431, "subjectivity": 0.4521111411736412},

The celebrity DJ-model-producer (and much more) shifted the paradigm in our favor in 2006 when she founded Black Girls Rock!, the award show and nonprofit organization that has since earned worldwide acclaim.\n\nFittingly, Bond literally holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014a phrase she recently discovered may have originated in friend and author Joan Morgan\u2019s \u201990s hip-hop feminist tome When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Bond loves that the expression has become a recent addition to our common lexicon about black womanhood, as she has made it her mission to help as many girls find their magic as possible.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do [with] Black Girls Rock!\u2014I\u2019ve been able to tap into our village to help me bring this to life and do this work.\n\nNow eBay is recognizing and supporting Bond\u2019s efforts by partnering with Black Girls Rock! for an epic inaugural auction to raise funds for the organization in honor of Black History Month. Launched on Feb. 5, the auction features such gems as a pair of worn and signed ballet shoes from Misty Copeland, coveted red-carpet access to the next Black Girls Rock! award show and signed copies of Bond\u2019s upcoming Black Girls Rock! book, which debuts on Feb. 27 and is already the No. 1 book in preorders on Amazon.com\u2014as well as the first prize to sell out on the eBay auction. As Bond tells The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m just really grateful\u2014it\u2019s exciting to see that people are receiving it so well. But also, it speaks to the importance of the message continuing\u2014the need for the message ... In 2006, when I started Black Girls Rock!, there wasn\u2019t this celebration, acknowledgment [or] inclusion of black women\u2019s narratives, stories, beauty, diversity, nuances\u2014it just wasn\u2019t there in media\u2014in fact, it was completely the opposite, if anything. And so to see where the world has come to now, in this time, and to see all this \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d surfacing\u2014or people discovering [it]\u2014it\u2019s just an incredible thing, to know that Black Girls Rock! was very much at the forefront of this movement. It means a lot, but I don\u2019t get fooled by trends ... I feel that the work needs to continue there, and I know that we have to continue to push our message, our narrative, and keep our presence in the forefront. We matter and our voices matter, and our accomplishments matter, our contributions matter, our achievements matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporting the accomplishments and achievements of future generations is at the heart of Black Girls Rock!, and 100 percent of proceeds from the auction will go back into the organization\u2019s programs, like the Black Girls Lead conference and camps, which have yielded proven results through mentorship, as Bond tells us:\n\nWe are really giving girls tools that they need to empower themselves to take their best to their \u201cbestest\u201d; to go to their next level. And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock! Awards in New York\u2014you will walk the red carpet alongside stars and have VIP seating to watch the entire show with some of the hottest celebs!\n\n\n\nNot in the market for some of the bigger-ticket items in the auction? EBay for Charity and Black Girls Rock! also partnered with fashion-accessory brand Pintrill to create exclusive enamel pins that are being sold on the platform throughout February. One says \u201cBlack Girls Rock!\u201d and the other says \u201cWESLAY.\u201d Each pin is available for $15, or you can purchase the pair for $25. You can also add an additional donation to your purchase during checkout. Remember\u2014100 percent of proceeds benefit Black Girls Rock!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBond hopes that this auction will be the first of many as she continues to grow Black Girls Rock! and ensure that #BlackGirlMagic remains more than a catchphrase, hashtag or trend. She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

In the accompanying 3:32 video, she gives us Tae-Bo chic, Versailles realness, and lots and lots of vogueing, all on a white soundstage.

I\u2019ll definitely be showing my age when I say that \u201cBeat for the Gods\u201d brought me back to both Madonna and RuPaul\u2019s biggest hits, with a healthy dose of Right Said Fred\u2019s 1991 one-hit-wonder, \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d (though I also gather that Cox may have also borrowed heavily from Jesse Vega\u2019s off-key 2017 single, \u201cBeat Your Face\u201d).\n\nAnd because Cox is a savvy style icon as well as a trans-activist, I\u2019m guessing this is no mistake. Much like the 90s-era push for political correctness (followed by subsequent decades of pushback), we have entered a new era of civil rights. Now, as much as any other time in history, it\u2019s imperative that we affirm folks\u2019 right to be exactly who they are, in whatever form that appears. And while we\u2019re not entirely sure of the meaning behing Cox\u2019s retro-inspired iteration, it\u2019s no less a reminder that, at the end of the day, we all deserve to feel pretty.\n\nAt the very least, let\u2019s remember who really started the ongoing vogueing phenomenon.", "keywords": ["lots", "officially", "according", "cox", "90s", "beat", "gods", "video", "coxs", "im", "remember", "single", "laverne", "right", "era", "vogueing"], "polarity": 0.09128555967841682, "subjectivity": 0.4034830447330447},

I, for one, can think of no more dynamic combination that a person might be. ... And that is why I say to you that, though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly so, doubly dynamic\u2014to be young, gifted and black.\n\nWriter and playwright Lorraine Hansberry was just shy of her 34th birthday when she said these words, part of a speech titled \u201cThe Nation Needs Your Gifts,\u201d to the winners of the Reader\u2019s Digest/United Negro College Fund creative-writing contest on May 1, 1964. She would not live to see her 35th birthday, tragically dying of pancreatic cancer on Jan. 12, 1965.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHansberry\u2019s brief but remarkable life is the subject of Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, a gorgeous new documentary debuting tonight on the series American Masters on PBS. The title is derived from a quote of Hansberry\u2019s about the activism that in large part inspired her artistry:\n\nOne cannot live with sighted eyes and feeling heart and not know or react to the miseries which afflict this world.\n\nThe Glow Up had the opportunity to speak with Tracy Heather Strain, director of Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, about the journey that led her to tell the story of the first black woman to write a play performed on Broadway (A Raisin in the Sun). For her, the journey began 40 years ago, when her grandmother took her to see a production of To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think everybody who encounters Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s words is really taken by her,\u201d Strain recalls. \u201cBut I think that if you\u2019re a young black woman and you haven\u2019t heard a lot of young black voices that were so strong and clear about what was good about society, what was bad about society\u2014racism, sexism, class issues\u2014she\u2019s so powerful.\u201d\n\nDirector Tracy Heather Strain on Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart (Now Magazine/YouTube)\n\nBut while Strain\u2019s interest in Hansberry began in her teens, her route to filmmaking was less direct. Heeding Spike Lee\u2019s early call to \u201cmake black film,\u201d she bravely abandoned a career in advertising and direct marketing for an entry-level position at a production company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, Strain attended a 1989 Boston production of Hansberry\u2019s final work, Les Blancs, and fortuitously met Hansberry\u2019s ex-husband and executor of her estate, fellow writer Robert Nemiroff. Having worked up the courage to suggest to him that there should be a documentary about Hansberry, Nemiroff told Strain that he had every intention of doing exactly that; having granted film producer Chiz Schultz exclusive access to the Hansberry material.\n\nBut Nemiroff\u2019s death in 1991 understandably stalled the project, which then remained dormant for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Strain progressed on her path to becoming a seasoned filmmaker, producer, director and writer. When Schultz began looking for a director to revive the concept, he was introduced to Strain. And she was more than ready to take it on.\n\n\u201cWe officially count the beginning of this project as 2004, so we say it\u2019s a 14-year journey. But for me personally, Hansberry\u2019s been in my head for a lot longer,\u201d she explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a truly beautiful two-hour tribute to an artist and activist who was well ahead of her time. Through interviews with contemporaries and friends like Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Sidney Poitier and Amiri Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones); coupled with Hansberry\u2019s own writings, narrated by actresses LaTanya Richardson Jackson and Anika Noni Rose (who voices Hansberry), we are introduced to a complex, deeply intuitive woman whose commitment to her work was paralleled only by her devotion to her race.\n\nWhat is perhaps most striking is how relevant Hansberry\u2019s work remains, over 50 years after her death. It is now especially poignant in an America that seems to equate making itself \u201cgreat again\u201d with catapulting us back to Jim Crow (at least). In Hansberry\u2019s own words:\n\nThe problem is we have to find some way with these dialogues to show and to encourage the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical. ... The basic organization of American society is the thing that has Negroes in the situation that they are in, and never let us lose sight of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrain agrees, admitting that despite the long road it took to get Hansberry\u2019s story onto the screen, her legacy hasn\u2019t diminished in the intervening years:\n\nI think that the underlying issues haven\u2019t really changed in our society for African-American lives. ... When we were trying to raise money for this, it was kind of frustrating for us that people were not getting that these words were relevant to the time. ... In 2004, you could see that her words were relevant. I think now, [with] it coming out at this particular moment in history, they seem more relevant and prescient and urgent. And I think while on the one hand, I wish it hadn\u2019t taken so long to make this film, I do think this film is coming out at the right moment.\n\nIn many ways, Hansberry\u2019s story may be even more relevant now, as it is finally a moment in time when it can be told in full. As a creative wrestling with sexual identity in addition to race and gender, Hansberry was a true example of radical intersectionality at a moment when the language to support her didn\u2019t yet exist. For Strain, it\u2019s most important that viewers come away with an understanding and respect for Hansberry\u2019s humanity, beyond the attributes that rightfully qualify her as a black American heroine.\n\nI think it\u2019s really important for people\u2014especially young people\u2014to understand how the person got to be in that revered position. What are the steps? Life\u2019s hard; being an artist, being a creative person, is usually a challenge for most people. And for Lorraine Hansberry, it was no exception. And so, I think it\u2019s important, especially for young people, to see fully complex human beings. ... And so, I hope that young people are inspired to think that getting an education and knowing your stuff is part of our history, too. It is not just somebody else\u2019s history. And I hope that with this film, anyone who [is] struggling with or juggling [their] identities, to know that they\u2019re not alone. Lorraine Hansberry wrestled with that. And then, finally, activism. You know, we have to all figure out how to contribute to making the change that we want to see. How do we make our society live up to its ideals? And I think Lorraine is a fitting figure to empower people to start wrestling with how they\u2019re going to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican Masters\u2019 Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart premieres Friday at 9 p.m. EST on PBS.", "keywords": ["eyesfeeling", "lorraine", "sighted", "look", "hansberrys", "legacy", "heart", "strain", "relevant", "think", "black", "loving", "young", "hansberry"], "polarity": 0.1804532392894461, "subjectivity": 0.5382370503060157},

We have spent hours arguing about whether okra is a vegetable or a delivery system for Satan\u2019s backwashed phlegm. We are divided on the societal need for pumpkin spice. Some of the staff wrongly believe that \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d is a good song. In fact, there is only one topic on which we can all agree:\n\n\n\nN***** is stupid.\n\nI\u2019m not referring to the word \u201cnigger\u201d or even the colloquial spelling \u201cnigga.\u201d I\u2019m talking about the asterisked, redacted version that even a third-grader knows means \u201cnigger.\u201d Anyone who uses the star-spangled censored version of the word might as well scream it at the top of their lungs. They\u2019re not fooling anyone.\n\n\n\nPeter Vescey said \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nDuring Monday night\u2019s game between the New York Knicks and the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron James and Knicks center Enes Kanter got into one of the many face-to-face mini-scuffles that happen in almost every NBA game. Veteran sports reporter Peter Vecsey thought it prudent to explain the incident by using a quote from the Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cNiggas Bleed\u201d in this tweet:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with white people?\n\nLook, I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain why white people can\u2019t use the word, except to say that I know it\u2019s hard for them to accept that something is off-limits when they live in a world where everything belongs to them. We have all heard every Caucasiansplanation of why it is racist that white people can\u2019t say the word. Ta-Nehisi Coates explained it best last week:\n\nI firmly believe that white people\u2019s desire to use the word is buried deep in the empty hole where the soul is usually located, just waiting for the right time to manifest itself. And just as with the desire to burn a cross on a lawn or jump-start a race war, I do not believe that all white people want to say it. But I don\u2019t even care what the percentage is because I know that enough white people hold that sentiment deep in their heart cavity that we are still having this conversation in the two-thousand-seventeenth year of our Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Vecsey is one of those white people.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The use of \u201cwhite people\u201d is totally appropriate here. It is the only explanation as to why a high school student would have the same question as 74-year-old Peter Vecsey. It is the only thing that connects a liberal elitist like Bill Maher to a Donald Trump-supporting Mississippian: whiteness and a desire to say \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVecsey is 74 years old and apparently is a fan of the Notorious B.I.G. He is also an old white man who seemingly longed to utter the word \u201cnigger,\u201d and a meaningless Monday-night game between two mediocre teams was his Caucasian Christmas.\n\nNo one thinks that Vecsey held a yearslong resentment against black people that festered inside him for seven-plus decades. I will even venture to say that Vecsey is not a racist. He probably doesn\u2019t hold an iota of hate in that heart that will soon stop ticking.\n\nPeter Vecsey is just white.\n\nThat\u2019s what white people do. They habitually line-step. They rape. They pillage. They take. Everything. There is no confusion about the word \u201cnigger.\u201d It belongs to one group of people and only one group of people. It is not complicated. Just. Don\u2019t. Say. It.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut white people cannot abide by that. They need a reason why they can\u2019t have it, too. Their privilege does not manifest itself in the fact that they want to use the word. It is in the fact that they believe they are owed an explanation for why they can\u2019t use it. That is the whitest part of the entire equation. As if \u201cBecause we said so\u201d is not enough of a reason.\n\nPeter Vecsey will probably apologize soon. He might delete the tweet and issue a mea culpa dripping with all of the appropriate white sincerity highlighted in the well-crafted retractions we have been inundated with lately. He will probably be suspended from his new job at NBA TV, and then he will retract his idiotic tweet, having fulfilled his internal, lifelong, unspoken nigger-spewing aspiration. America is nothing if not the land of second chances. Do not cry for Peter Vecsey because Peter Vecsey is white, and whiteness is a singular kind of power.\n\nIt is the same power and privilege that assumes a single black person would want to stand for the same flag that waved over the holocaust of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the genocide of lynching and every single injustice that ever existed for black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlavery wasn\u2019t that bad; get over it. Jim Crow was 40 years ago. He just said \u201cnigger\u201d; what\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nThat kind of power is what deludes men like Peter Vecsey into thinking that they can take a word that doesn\u2019t belong to them and fling it around all willy-nilly. It can make a man think that he can grab a woman by the pussy. It will make the words of an alleged pedophile outweigh the accusations of five women and 30 corroborating sources. They believe all pussies belong to them. All things. All the time.\n\nIt is also the power that will make people eventually forgive Peter Vecsey for saying \u201cnigger\u201d ... because they will. It made people call bragging about sexual assault \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d It has Alabamians deliberating on whether or not they will send an accused child molester to represent them in the Senate chambers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVecsey didn\u2019t hurt a soul with his tweet. I doubt if anyone was genuinely offended. The reason people weren\u2019t upset by what he said is that Americans\u2014especially black people\u2014have grown accustomed to it. What Vecsey did is neither new nor surprising. We have grown to expect it from white people.\n\nAnd Peter Vecsey is white people.", "keywords": ["believe", "word", "probably", "white", "peter", "nigger", "vecsey", "black", "cant", "say"], "polarity": -0.018314425038562968, "subjectivity": 0.4087309051102154},

It has so many layers, and I want to get it right.\n\nMaybe I should tell you about the lady who wants to pull a Kylie and Kendall by taking \u201990s-era hip-hop artists, putting her name on it and selling it as a children\u2019s book. I could write about how she and her husband-boyfriend chilled in blackface.

They did it to the blues and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and made the Rolling Stones \u201cthe World\u2019s Greatest Band.\u201d They watched the slaves on Saturday nights and invented \u201cAmerican dance.\u201d Every American art form is a remix of black art.\n\nOr, instead of a lesson about cultural appropriation, I could make this a macro think piece about the overall historical boldness of white people (I refer to it as \u201ccaucasity\u201d\u2014white audacity). How they refer to colonialism, land stealing and gentrification as \u201cprogress\u201d or \u201cexpansion.\u201d How they think that everything belongs to them.

Who wouldn\u2019t want to teach their kids the ABCs by looking at rap songs? I know it sounds like the most Caucasian idea ever, because there is already a centuries-old, verified way to teach children the alphabet, but if white people weren\u2019t always tinkering with shit, we wouldn\u2019t have the microwave oven or atomic bombs.\n\nSo Illuminaughty messaged the publisher because she wanted to know who was getting her money. And also because her Twitter name is @sweetfacedinero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, despite all their supposed knowledge of hip-hop, the Chihas didn\u2019t understand that, while it may work in their neck of the woods, \u201cno answer\u201d is not an acceptable response in black culture. Illuminaughty wanted to know more, because\u2014did I mention her Twitter handle? So she did a little digging and found this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this jewel on the Instagram account:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter people discovered the book, they complained so much that at least one website removed it, and the Little Homie (the Chihas\u2019 company name/social media brand) made its social media accounts private.

In the aftermath of the release, Candice Benbow\u2019s \u201c4:43\u201d spoke to nearly every black woman I know about what it means for men to finally reckon with honesty and faithfulness\u2014or not to\u2014at the expense of the women they claim to love.\n\nHowever, men weren\u2019t collectively as gracious, and although a 4:44 syllabus created by Anthony Boynton addressed issues of toxic masculinity and manhood, the reception from some men seemed to decry Jay as a \u201csellout\u201d to women. How dare he apologize? Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood. And when it comes to toxic masculinity and its relationship to womanhood, I\u2019m interested to see if Jay will, at some point, walk us through his understanding of the humanity of queer men as well.\n\nBut the presence of Janet Mock gives me hope. Not hope of acceptance\u2014that would just be empty rhetoric and truly a pitch to tokenism of the basest form. No, I hope that her presence is an acknowledgment of the personhood of queer folks. The ongoing murders of trans women\u2014particularly those of color\u2014speak to a deep and entrenched toxic combination of internalized racism and unhealthy masculinity that continues to inhabit our communities.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time for people to recognize that the most marginalized voices in the room\u2014those of trans women of color\u2014should be centered in our conversations when we are talking about getting free. Maybe our human family can stop the feuding over gender-identity labels and start thinking more broadly about what it means to be a man or a woman or genderqueer. That said, I\u2019m not going to label this video as a catalyst for that freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I am going to call it a start.", "keywords": ["woman", "jayzs", "seat", "family", "belongs", "tokenism", "women", "feud", "makes", "video", "finally", "queer", "im", "black", "major", "jay", "trans", "table", "statement", "men"], "polarity": 0.13311459667093473, "subjectivity": 0.527593896713615},

It is a dangerous, albeit relatable, thought for many people who have experienced romantic love. Although I will not commit this thought to action, it tells me that toxic things are taking place in both my environment and the dynamic of my relationship. Thoughts are intangible, but they are far from inconsequential. It is thoughts that create presidencies and sustain toxic cultures.\n\nKeith Boykin recently wrote an article titled \u201cIn Defense of Lust\u201d as a response to an article by writer Darnell Moore titled \u201cThe Bodies of Others Are Not Mine.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote poetically about fundamental feminist truths around queer men and our objectification of one another. Moore interrogates his own habits when interacting with other men and invites gay men to do the same for themselves. The idea of his essay was to push and queer the conversation around rape culture past the heteronormative lens through which we\u2019ve been looking at it ever since the Hollywood sex scandals around Harvey Weinstein penetrated the public consciousness.\n\nBoykin\u2019s article challenges Moore\u2019s and states the case that thoughts can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be policed\u2014that as long as no action is being committed, there is no offense to apologize for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a post-The Secret world, it was surprising to read words, especially from a writer, that attempted to declaw the power of thought. Boykin writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental distinction between thought and behavior, and this is what concerns me most about policing our imagination. Sexual misconduct is a serious societal problem that deserves the attention of men of all sexual orientations, but in our effort to eradicate sexual assault and rape culture, we need not rid ourselves of desire and lust.\u201d\n\nThought and behavior do not live separately; in fact, they depend on each other. Thoughts create behavior. And behaviors, practiced enough, create environments and culture.\n\nInside of spaces for queer men, patriarchal thoughts are accepted\u2014thoughts like the fantasies void of consent, like what Boykins wrote about Moore: \u201cI turn him toward the tree and enter him from behind, holding his neck down for balance and dominance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just a fantasy detailing an erotic wish; this is a fantasy detailing assault\u2014shared publicly with an alarming lack of awareness of how its publishing alone could make its subject uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nPatriarchal behavior is constantly excused and often fetishized. There are countless articles demonstrating how stereotypical toxic masculine behavior, which includes everything from exhibiting violent behaviors when mad to touching people with no consent, is preferred by a large portion of gay men. Because of this, a patriarchal culture and environment are created. And one of the symptoms of this patriarchal environment is rape culture. This is the culture that made Boykin think that expressing his more-toxic fantasies was a just rebuttal to an article about queerness and objectification.\n\nMy second thought when reading Boykin\u2019s article was how people\u2014especially those who claim a radical queer or gay politic\u2014must elevate the conversation around desire, lust and the erotic. Whom you lust over and how you lust and how you express desire for another man is not created in a vacuum; it is informed by everything you\u2019ve experienced up until that lustful moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Moore was pushing us to think about with his article is what informs these \u201crandom\u201d moments of dehumanizing someone who has the same gender, sexuality and race experience as oneself.\n\nMoments where black men can\u2019t engage with other black men beyond their body, face or sexuality disturb me because it reminds me of the narrative of black men\u2019s history in America. It reminds me that even between two black men, the physical appraisal of someone takes priority over a type of intellectual or nonsexual emotional engagement with each other.\n\nIt reminds me of the auction block, where black people were mules being looked over. It reminds me of the rape and castration of black men and the narrative that the sum of black men\u2019s worth is in their sexuality, their labor and their usefulness inside of the white supremacist patriarchy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, your wet dream fantasy is not harmless. It strips black men of humanity and instead demonizes and eroticizes them beyond recognition.\n\nFinally, there was a total lack of any kind of analysis on power. As I read the cases against Harvey Weinstein as well as Bill Cosby, one common thread I found was their power to change environments\u2014to turn professional spaces into sexual ones. To transform friendly outings into dangerous, predatory moments.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that before a Cosby places a drug inside a martini, or before a Weinstein pulls his dick out of his pants, a sexual, erotic fantasy often occurs that involves the rapist in power and the victim submitting. They act on that fantasy and quickly change the environment from a safe moment to a dangerous, predatory moment. One\u2019s ability to do that as a man still exists, even if the one being pursued is another man. That is something to agitate, interrogate and\u2014perhaps\u2014even police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven inside my own experiences with rape, sexual assault, harassment and molestation, it is clear that the untamed male imagination is what activated those violent moments in my life. I know transgender people who were killed because of a cisgender man\u2019s untamed imagination and his shame around it. From experience, I have undergone rape and assault because of closeted, masculine men\u2019s untamed imaginations.\n\nThe imagination is something to take seriously. Writers and intellectuals especially should know this, since so much of our work is rooted in the imagination and our ability to capture that of the public.\n\nMy boyfriend is alive, but in those toxic moments when I thought about harm and violence, I thought about what else was lurking. I found that a struggle for power and an insecurity informed by patriarchal standards lived in our relationship dynamic, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a way, Boykin is correct: Thoughts and the imagination are not things to be policed, but they are something to be examined, and in some cases, they hold hints to where the soul needs healing.

But no one has quite come close to dragging him like actress Rose McGowan. McGowan was always vocal about sleazeballs like Weinstein, even prior to the New York Times and the New Yorker posting their explosive expos\u00e9s. But regarding this ordeal, she has emerged as a Katniss Everdeen of sorts, coming for every famous male actor who either dismissed her or did something trifling back in the day, too.\n\n\n\nObviously, I support this.

Which is why we are gathered here today.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all the goodwill McGowan collected over the past couple of weeks, she managed to fuck that up in one week by tweeting out a now-deleted tweet that equated [white] women (because that\u2019s who she meant) with the premier slur for black people. This was her way of shaming James Corden for triflingly joking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\n\nShe, essentially, went full white feminist.\n\n\n\nOf course, this was expected. White women historically and embarrassingly continue to drop the intersectional ball. But even with that being the case, there are some other reasons that the fact that white feminism is rearing its basic-ass head this time around shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. *That boycott* reinforced that solidarity really only is for white women.\n\nThis past week, before her horrendous tweet, McGowan was suspended from Twitter because of what some saw as her speaking out against the culture of silence that aggravated sexual violence in Hollywood\u2019s inner circle for decades. While she was reinstated later, cries to boycott the platform over her suspension rang out from a particular subset of Twitter (I\u2019ll let you guess who). The plan was for women to boycott Twitter for the day by not tweeting at all.\n\nI caught wind of this boycott Thursday evening (the night before) and briefly considered it when I thought: What sense does it make to protest being silenced ... by being silent? It sounds like some rhetorical circle jerk, but think about it: If the powers that be want you to shut the fuck up (especially in online spaces like Twitter), why would you do that? Why give them what they want?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo black femmes like me, it appeared to be counterintuitive, but also showed one thing:\n\n\n\nWhite women are often the only people who can afford to stay silent.\n\nThat silence was an option to begin with proved that point, but it also showed the immense cognitive dissonance white feminists display when they try to engage in matters of social justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, silence is often equatable to death. We go through enough silencing, suppression and harassment over our voices day in and day out (which I\u2019m about to get to). So who exactly thought it wise to tell us that we should totally volunteer to give up our voices for the day? Hmm?\n\nThankfully, our favorite social media superstar, April Reign, fixed that glaring oversight with an adjacent protest (#WOCAffirmation), but that still doesn\u2019t even begin to tackle the central issue many of us had with the boycott to begin with. Even if one were to excuse the method that was employed, there\u2019d still be one problem left:\n\nThe timing.\n\nIndeed. The whole reason I abstained from boycotting was the fact that I could not get behind the insulting transparency of taking up arms for Rose McGowan but leaving black women like Jemele Hill and Leslie Jones to be devoured by the wolves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth examples are painful reminders of what happens to black women who are loud and proud with their voices. Hill, a private citizen, was harassed by the White House\u2014by 45, the (unfortunate) president of the United States\u2014for correctly referring to him as a white supremacist. She was almost replaced at ESPN for her first \u201coffense\u201d and then unceremoniously suspended by the network for her \u201csecond\u201d offense.\n\nAnd while black women came out strong for her (as per usual), there were crickets from the same people who would have rioted for McGowan. No call for a Twitter boycott. No assistance from Twitter to stave off 45\u2019s attacks.\n\nBut that last part is unsurprising. Twitter has never cared about the harassment of black women on its platform. No, it would rather give us all 280 characters to waste and circular-profile pictures because why the fuck not?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there\u2019s no greater example of this than Leslie Jones. After accepting what she thought was going to be a fun and harmless role in the Ghostbusters reboot, Jones endured harassment for months. This escalated and reached a fever pitch when Milo Yuckyanduntalented intentionally went after her.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not gonna rehash everything she was called or likened to, but Twitter took no action until Jones herself retweeted and quoted-tweeted the harassment as a \u201cLOOK AT THIS SHIT\u201d tactic for someone to pay attention to.\n\nAfter days of the onslaught, Twitter finally (begrudgingly) banned Milo from Twitter. And even then, support didn\u2019t come for her until #LoveForLeslieJ was created by @MarsInCharge\u2014who is, wouldn\u2019t you know it, a black femme. And with that hashtag came the punctuation of an eternal point:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only support that black women have in this world is the support that we give to one another and ourselves.\n\nAnd speaking of support for black women:\n\n2. McGowan\u2019s limp, disjointed, two-tweet \u201capology\u201d demonstrates a profound lack of intersectionality and proves that she cannot be bothered with either repentance or accountability.\n\nThere were some who held out hope (I was not one of them) that even with McGowan\u2019s fuck-ass tweet, she\u2019d own up to her gap in logic and apologize accordingly. This is not what happened. Instead, we got a painfully underdeveloped \u201capology\u201d split up in two pathetic tweets. One quite frankly blamed it on weed, and the other was her apologizing to \u201cany \u2018POC\u2019 that were offended.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQu\u00e9?\n\nI don\u2019t know this \u201cPOC\u201d to whom she is referring. I really don\u2019t. You know why? Because she didn\u2019t further marginalize, minimize or Columbus the struggle of \u201cPOC\u201d when she made her offending tweet. She further marginalized, minimized and Columbused the struggle of black people. Specifically black women ... who, for the last time, live at the intersection of both (hello, misogynoir).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding McGowan\u2019s tweet, \u201cnigger\u201d is not a historical slur against \u201cPOC.\u201d It is a slur against black people. Black. People. Referring to white women as such is not only gross hyperbole but is fundamentally false. White women are not black and therefore will never know that struggle.\n\nEquating yourself to such because you have the misfortune of coming just below Chet Cheterson on the privilege pyramid does not a nigger make.\n\nPeriod.\n\nSo instead of co-opting the struggle of black people by making false equivalencies such as these, McGowan should have been preoccupied with putting in some damn work and finding some way to call out James Corden without throwing black women (and black people at large) under the bus. Again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since that didn\u2019t happen, since she used the specific pain of black women to make that gross analogy, that same fucking specificity should have been employed to apologize to black women.\n\nNot \u201cPOC.\u201d Not \u201cWOC.\u201d Black women.\n\nIf McGowan can tweet that shit with her chest, she should be able to apologize with her chest, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd make no mistake.\n\nWhile I greatly empathize with McGowan\u2019s pain and the pain of any survivor (which was well-documented this past weekend with #MeToo), white feminists like her shouldn\u2019t let John Lennon and Yoko Ono get them fought. Because white women are not the \u201cnigger of the world.\u201d\n\nAnd they never will be.", "keywords": ["continued", "day", "white", "mcgowan", "support", "failure", "women", "boycott", "rose", "black", "twitter", "solidarityisforwhitewomen", "feminism", "poc", "weinstein"], "polarity": -0.01231263067997762, "subjectivity": 0.41289792973466416},

CVS is also asking brands that are sold in its stores to disclose which elements of a model\u2019s appearance have been altered in the ads for products on display.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid moderated a panel that included Matlins, Chief Marketing Officer of CVS Health Norman de Greve, Revlon-endorsed supermodel and body-positive activist Ashley Graham, activist beauty blogger and documentarian Noor Tagouri, and celebrity makeup artist and Honest Beauty spokesman Daniel Martin to discuss how truth in advertising can help alleviate some of the inadequacies we can feel when faced with unobtainable images of beauty presented as reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the issues discussed were how how happiness is tied to expectations, and how well our expectations match reality\u2014or not\u2014in the digital era of filters and \u201cliquify\u201d tools that enhance not only professional but amateur photographs. In terms of how this affects self-esteem and body image, the statistics cited by panel members were eye-opening, even for a lot of industry vets in the audience:\n\n\n\n80 percent of women feel worse after looking at beauty ads.\n\n\n\n30 percent of high school girls have some type of eating disorder.\n\n\n\n42 percent of first- to third-graders want to be thinner.\n\n\n\n90 percent of girls ages 15-17 want to change one major thing about themselves.\n\n\n\nThe discussion also covered men and body issues, and boys who \u201cfeel more beautiful when they wear makeup,\u201d like Matlins\u2019 12-year-old son, who writes a blog about beauty for boys. Looking at the statistics\u2014and as a mom in midlife with a blog where I don\u2019t retouch, for all the reasons listed above\u2014I think the time is 100 percent right to make authentic individuality and self-acceptance the highest aspiration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see the full one-hour talk here.", "keywords": ["sold", "products", "cvs", "finally", "real", "panel", "advertising", "truth", "retouch", "matlins", "photographs", "feel", "girls", "beauty"], "polarity": 0.27337625018659495, "subjectivity": 0.5197216002388416},

Well, Mona Scott-Young if Mona Scott-Young were a 71-year-old white man with the intellectual curiosity of Cujo (after Cujo was shot dead), and the emotional intelligence of a raging teenager who just gulped the last bottle of Four Loko in North America. Yes, that\u2019s it.\n\n\n\nThe longer this disaster of an administration goes on, the more it feels as if anyone who chooses to work at the White House faces risks more akin to a rookie reality-television personality than to any political appointee. Usually, a political staffer may be ousted, but at the very least, they can keep their dignity, marriages and spines intact as they go pimp the speaker and TV-pundit circuit. Not so much with Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, no. You enter this bitch, and chances are you will leave with irreparable damage to your reputation. Of course, it\u2019s unsurprising that a reality-TV-star candidate for president runs his White House as if it were a reality show. And considering that 45 cares only about Twitter, various strains of prejudice, golf and yelling at cable news, I imagine that the man would much rather pit his staff against one another and let chaos ensue than read his daily briefs.\n\n\n\nBut at least reality stars walk away from national embarrassment with a new stream of income by way of a mixtape, liquor line, Instagram boutique or invitation to join the cast of the new season of WE tv\u2019s Marriage Boot Camp. What are newly departed fools of Sweet Potato Saddam\u2019s administration leaving with? I almost feel bad for the newly fired fools, who signed up to serve a disloyal, lazy thot who ultimately plays the shit out of each of them. I say \u201calmost\u201d\n\nbecause when you sign up to work for white supremacy\u2019s equivalent of the D-League, this is what your ass gets.\n\n\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\n\nTo that end, let us begin with Anthony Scaramucci, who somehow managed the feat of being fired before he officially started his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal as communications director especially hilarious is that he was just talking cash-money shit to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll all be fired by me,\u201d he said. \u201cI fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I\u2019ll fire tomorrow. I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus\u2014if you want to leak something\u2014he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly.\u201d The issue, he said, was that he believed Priebus had been worried about the dinner because he hadn\u2019t been invited. \u201cReince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,\u201d Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke: \u201c \u2018Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I liked Scaramucci, but I did find him entertaining. He also seemed like someone that, too, enjoys Deion Sanders\u2019 underappreciated bop, \u201cMust Be the Money.\u201d (Beyonc\u00e9 likes it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite part of the New Yorker interview:\n\nScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock,\u201d he said, speaking of Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201d (Bannon declined to comment.)\n\nSteve Bannon doesn\u2019t appear to be that limber, but I believe Scaramucci. Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["supremacy", "scaramucci", "white", "man", "yalls", "president", "scaramuccis", "im", "real", "priebus", "housewives", "chief", "turned", "45", "house", "spicer"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

She was fine\u2014like an Asian Apollonia, but just a bit thicker, with a dynamite smile and an easy laugh. She was also the sister of a guy I worked and hung out with, and I liked her immediately.\n\n\n\nUp to that point, my dating history had been seriously spotty: I\u2019d been in love with and lost my best friend, and at the time I was kinda, sorta, maybe still dating a young woman off at boot camp. It was the middle of winter when L and her brother came through to play some board games and chill. I remember as we set up the board for a game of \u201cLife,\u201d I selected two pink pegs. She also selected two pink pegs\u2014and moved a few inches closer to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the night progressed, she flirted harder with me as her brother got more and more pissed. While we were getting a drink from the kitchen, he told me \u201cnot to fuck with his sister.\u201d Long story short, we did\u2014and it spiraled out of control. Let\u2019s just say there\u2019s nothing like a boyfriend scorned and a str8 girl who sends you a romantic letter, then pretends she was an innocent being hotly pursued by a lesbian.\n\nLet me just take a moment to explain what I mean by \u201cstr8.\u201d I\u2019m not talking about heterosexual women who have experimented once or twice. I\u2019ve never been with a heterosexual woman who didn\u2019t explicitly say from the beginning that this was just a moment of curiosity and then we\u2019re good. I\u2019m using the term \u201cstr8\u201d because it\u2019s tongue-in-cheek\u2014these women will get in bed with you then act like they are the victims of a lesbian predator. Or they\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, we were so drunk last night\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t go that way.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m talking about women who are sexually and emotionally manipulative with lesbians. Str8 girls are not typically out here claiming labels of bisexuality, heteroflexibility or pansexuality\u2014at least, not in public. These are women who are insecure about their own sexuality while trying to fuck with yours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy history with str8 women is why Netflix\u2019s recent iteration of She\u2019s Gotta Have It had me tripping over the relationship between Opal Gilstrap and Nola Darling. First of all, I have to give a shoutout to Spike Lee and his crew for changing Opal from a predatory lesbian into a lesbian with her humanity intact. But I gotta call b.s. on Nola being \u201cpansexual.\u201d When the character told the audience she was taking a break from men and using Opal as a \u201cpalate cleanser,\u201d I nearly lost my shit. I\u2019ll be damned if a woman uses me (and my skills) in between stops in Penistown just so she can take a break from the drama of her man woes.\n\nGIF\n\nI get it; Nola is written as the type of chick who will turn the heads of women and men, so I\u2019m not looking at Opal completely sideways when she tries to wife her up. But Opal\u2014being an adult lesbian\u2014should know that Nola ain\u2019t the one. She\u2019s fun to Netflix and chill with\u2014and that sex scene was some decent choreography\u2014but her heart and body are really with men. And if she looks at a woman as a layover until the next dick, she\u2019s not living her pansexuality. She\u2019s a str8 girl using a social identity as a way to cover up her sloppiness. Not cool\u2014not cool at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany lesbians have been with str8 girls. To some degree, women and girls are typically socialized to define ourselves through our relationships, and some of our strongest emotions can be connected to our relationships with our female friends. I know so many straight women whose most intimate relationships are with their sister-friends\u2014so much so that I sometimes wonder if there\u2019s something more happening there.\n\nThe well of emotions between women runs deep, so it\u2019s not surprising that when a woman comes into her sexual identity as a lesbian, her first loves are usually her female friends. And sometimes that leads to an awakening with the friend, and sometimes that means you fall for a woman who is curious but not really interested in a long-term relationship with a woman. In short: Your world gets jacked by a str8 girl. Many a young lesbian\u2019s heart has been broken by the friend who wanted to make out but then ignored you in the hallway at school or around other friends.\n\n\n\nOpal does the worst thing a lesbian can do with a str8 girl, which is engage with Nola as if she is a prospective mate and not the casual, fun, momentary fling that she is. It\u2019s the kind of cue that lets you know the people helming this project have no understanding of pansexual identity, as it reads more heteronormative fantasy than actual reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original Opal was symbolic of the problematic \u201chunt\u201d for heterosexual women and was rightfully labeled and critiqued as predatory by both men and other lesbians. Some of us go through that, too; internalized homophobia can often account for the attraction when we attempt to sex and wife up only str8 women. It\u2019s another level of attempting to \u201cpass\u201d in the straight world. A str8 girl is usually hyperaware that her gender presentation holds up in the heteronormative world\u2014and she\u2019s very aware of how lesbian women don\u2019t \u201cfit,\u201d straight-passing or not. Therein lies the power: access to sex but also emotional manipulation.\n\nBut for those of us who spent a number of our early years chasing heterosexual women in an effort to prove we could bed them, the \u201chunt\u201d is also an extension of the toxic masculine behavior of the men we are often surrounded by. You know, the ones who believe if a lesbian only had some good \u201cD,\u201d she\u2019d change her ways. (Nah, bruh. It doesn\u2019t work like that.)\n\nThe question really is, should a lesbian get down with\u2014or try to wife\u2014a str8 girl? For me, the answer is no, but it also depends. You have to know who you are and be comfortable with your identity as a lesbian. No matter whether you\u2019re a femme (str8 girls like you because it feels kind of fun, like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d), a stud (str8 girls like you \u2019cause you \u201clook kinda like a boy,\u201d but it feels kind of fun, like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d) or somewhere in between (str8 girls like you because you\u2019re \u201cinteresting\u201d and it feels kind of fun, like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d), you have to know that this woman is not going to be anything more than a fling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtect your emotions, because one minute you\u2019ll be their sexy secret, and the next, they\u2019ll claim you\u2019re some crazy lesbian obsessed with them. And even though they may be right about your obsession, they\u2019ll never own the emotional manipulation they engaged in.\n\nBottom line: If a woman ever tells you \u201cLesbians love me,\u201d run.

I loved Ms. J.\n\n\n\nI was a rascally little kid who got into constant trouble and who was visibly crushing on the girl across the street. Today we might call her my \u201cfrenemy,\u201d but back then, I just thought she was my bestie. Needless to say, I was pretty clueless.\n\nI remember one day, a couple of the neighborhood boys and I were sitting on my porch, as kids did back then in the summertime. Ms. J. was out in her yard doing what older black women do. As one of the boys\u2019 older siblings came over to the porch, he called out:\n\n\u201cHey, Ms. J.\u201d\n\nShe turned around, smiled and waved, then went back to what she was doing. I remember wishing I could have a pair of overalls like her; that I could have her swagger. She wore her long gray hair French-braided down her back while she chewed on a matchstick, and you never saw her without the hilt of her switchblade sticking out the back pocket of her overalls.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMs. J. is cool,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMs. J. a bulldagger,\u201d the older boy hissed.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what a \u201cbulldagger\u201d was, but the way he said it made it sound bad. And I didn\u2019t want to be bad, but I knew that Ms. J. and I had a kinship. And besides, being a bulldagger didn\u2019t look too bad to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday I identify as a butch/stud lesbian. When I mention these identities where I live and work, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m resurrecting a dinosaur. Many of the queer folk in my field and the place I live who once identified as masculine of center, butch, studs or tombois have since transitioned to trans men. As a result, I know a gang of trans men and very, very few MoC queer women. And while we could argue all day about so-called butch flight and how transphobic the concept is, the absence of butch women in the LGBTQIA conversation is glaring.\n\n\n\nThe last time I saw a black butch woman on TV was on The Wire. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, her name was Snoop (portrayed by Felicia \u201cSnoop\u201d Pearson), an integral part of Marlo\u2019s crew, and both respected and feared. She embodied the cool of butchness, as well as the toxic masculinity of the men around her. Today her closest predecessor is Young M.A., possibly one of the most skilled MCs out there\u2014but the misogyny embedded in her lyrics makes me cringe. As a femme friend said on Facebook, \u201cDegradation is not part of my erotic tool kit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us who identify as MoC, what is it about our butchness that requires us to be invested in toxic masculinity?\n\nThe Good Men Project defines toxic masculinity as \u201ca narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status, and aggression. It\u2019s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly \u2018feminine\u2019 traits\u2014which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual\u2014are the means by which your status as [a] \u2018man\u2019 can be taken away.\u201d\n\nWhen I was a baby butch, I hung with a group of guys who were all about being \u201cmen.\u201d Their behavior around me was part of their way of proving their manhood, and my behavior around them was about proving my masculinity. I was never confused about my womanhood, but I definitely knew I wasn\u2019t in the least bit feminine. So when they would call women bitches and hoes, so did I. When they would grab their crotches, so did I. When they would hold back their emotions, so would I. We were all playing at some form of manhood. I was emulating what I thought black men were, and so were they.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also spent time trying to figure out if I\u2019d had \u201cgood-enough dick\u201d yet. Sometimes I was just one of the \u201cniggas\u201d; sometimes I was this chick that one of them could \u201chit\u201d and make straight.\n\nBut I\u2019d been learning toxic masculinity since I was a kid. My pops is an old-school player; having a daughter freaked him out. Not only was he overprotective\u2014my first date was prom, which is another story\u2014but he very much had the idea that women were dumb, naive and vulnerable prey. That was the message I got as a young girl, and that was the message that shaped my identity as a butch woman.\n\nMy own understanding of femmes was shaped by that message, as well as the friendships I had with men. Prior to fully coming out, when I dated men, I\u2019d also see them as less than men because how could any \u201creal\u201d man want to be with a woman who was damn near a dude herself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost likely, the reason we don\u2019t often see butch/MoC women in mainstream media is that MoC lesbian bodies aren\u2019t there for the male gaze. It\u2019s too challenging for our heteropatriarchal world. Women have \u201ca place,\u201d and MoC lesbians buck that in more ways than just a sexual one.\n\nThe presence of MoC women is a very direct, almost gladiatorial challenge to the concept of masculinity. Today we are seeing in a very real way how men assert their violent ideas of masculinity, through the diverse and rapidly growing group of men who are finally being called to task for their unhealthy and illegal behaviors toward women (and men).\n\nI don\u2019t hang with that particular group of dudes anymore; I grew up and moved away. But looking back, that time in my life was about not only the formation of my butch/MoC identity, but also a deeper understanding of my blackness as a black/biracial woman.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI still kind of chuckle about my relationships with my current group of male friends. They are all social justice minded, and most would call themselves feminists or women-affirming men. And yet even knowing my identity, they\u2019ll sometimes open the door for me, talk about me having children (not that you can\u2019t give birth as a MoC woman) or remark how \u201cpretty\u201d I am when I\u2019m dressed up.\n\nHow about saying how handsome I am?\n\nThese men see my fat body with its hips, ass and boobs, and no matter how fly I look in my menswear attire, they occasionally try to pull out my chair. Some would say that men shouldn\u2019t do this for any woman\u2014femme and MoC alike\u2014and that\u2019s valid. However, for me, these behaviors often feel like their subtle way of expressing their dominance over me, in the guise of just being \u201cpolite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I wish for butch/MoC identities is that we are increasingly included in the conversation and projected onto the screen. Not just as a nod to dapper sensibility\u2014there\u2019s some fetishizing and body-shaming in some of these conversations\u2014but as a complicated identity that isn\u2019t out-of-date or out of step with the fluidity of queer identities. The fact is, being butch/MoC in public is sometimes a very dangerous way to live.\n\nAnd yet I can\u2019t imagine living any other way.", "keywords": ["woman", "dont", "progressive", "replace", "politics", "masculine", "women", "thinking", "center", "older", "ms", "masculinity", "moc", "butch", "stage", "way", "men", "j"], "polarity": 0.05990103050709112, "subjectivity": 0.4787477954144622},

By comparison, Rosepine High School is 86 percent white and only 6 percent black, Public School Review\u2019s 2015 stats show.\n\nAccording to a story in Pen Point News and The Root\u2019s reporting, when the mostly black North Central Eagles took the field against the majority-white Rosepine Eagles, at least one of North Central\u2019s African-American players had already decided to kneel during the playing of the national anthem to protest racial injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of North Central\u2019s students wrote on his Twitter account days before playing at Rosepine: \u201ceven myself being a young man i know about injustice that goes on in this country, which is why i # TakeTheKnee before every football game.\u201d\n\nThat student, away from home, playing against a majority-white town, watched the Rosepine players burst onto the field for homecoming carrying American flags, and as the Rosepine team played the national anthem, he stuck to his convictions and took a knee.\n\nThat did not sit well with the Rosepine crowd.\n\nMaybe I should mention how much the people of Rosepine love the flag, again.

He wrote that he has worked for three presidents\u2014George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump\u2014and \u201cin working with the current administration, it has become clear to me that we need improvements to the existing ethics program.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Shaub did not directly attack Trump, his administration or their supposed \u201cethics\u201d in either his letter of resignation or his tweets following it, the shade is there between the lines, and we all see it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post reports that White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, \u201cThe White House accepts Mr. Shaub\u2019s resignation and appreciates his service,\u201d and she indicated that the president would nominate a successor \u201cin short order.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it just me, or does it seem strange that Trump would be the one to nominate a successor to the office that is put in place to make sure he does everything above board?\n\nYou know what?

Was it awkward, exhilarating, overwhelming, tender, traumatic\u2014or some combination of all of the above?\n\nMine was all of those things. I was a high schooler in suburban Chicago, in the throes of my first\u2014and at that age, what I believed would be my last\u2014love. Even today, I can sincerely say that it was true\u2014if young\u2014love; and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion, I threw my inexperienced self headlong into it ...\n\nAt least, until my mother found out.\n\nTo say that my mother didn\u2019t take the loss of my virginity well would be putting it mildly. While she\u2019d educated me about sexuality and sexual health since I was 6 years old, I discovered my own sexuality earlier than either of us had planned\u2014if you can plan such a thing. I may have been in love, but for my mother and me, that revelation was mutually traumatic. I was mortified and scared; she was angry, disappointed, and\u2014as I\u2019d come to understand years later\u2014terrified by the thought that I might have compromised myself and my future so early in life.\n\nWhile we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there was something instantly recognizable about last Wednesday\u2019s episode of Grown-ish, in which protagonist Zoey Johnson and mom Rainbow (in a guest appearance by her Black-ish mom, Tracee Ellis Ross) found themselves in much the same situation. In a brief but poignant scene, Zoey revealed to her mother that she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014and had sex for the first time. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d she asked. In the pregnant pause that followed (pun intended), I cringed along with her as she awaited her mother\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2014I just don\u2019t want to think about it ... but did you use protection? ... It was bound to happen at some point,\u201d Rainbow sputtered.\n\n\n\nIt was a refreshing moment\u2014and a departure from the usual conversations that occur around black girls and sexuality, in which we are generally divorced from our own innocence and vulnerability. The truth is, we\u2019re rarely presumed to be in love (or given the space to be), or exercising decision-making based on sexual autonomy and emotional intimacy\u2014let alone smart enough to protect ourselves. Instead, we\u2019re generally cast as over-sexualized and often \u201casking for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Zoey\u2019s being of college age was likely another key factor in how this scenario played out, even as a fictional mother (and doctor), Rainbow understood that sexuality was a natural part of her daughter\u2019s maturation. She also seemed to understand that that development wasn\u2019t destined to happen on her time. Her primary concerns\u2014aside from her child\u2019s physical safety\u2014were not for her daughter\u2019s \u201cpurity,\u201d but for the larger implications of her making what could be a lifelong commitment at such a young age; in this case, to leave college with a potentially NBA-bound boyfriend.\n\n\u201cZoey, I did not raise you like this,\u201d Rainbow ranted. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman who\u2019s just going to throw it all away for some guy? You worked so hard to get here!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the writers\u2019 room at Grown-ish really got it right this episode. Because instead of focusing on the loss of virginity (which didn\u2019t even merit its own scene), the focus was rightly placed on what it means for a black girl to commit herself to someone\u2014in mind and body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the discussion I wish my mother and I had had all those years ago. I wish she\u2019d trusted that she\u2019d taught me well on how to conduct myself physically, and focused on the emotional implications of my choice. Because while we often prepare our children for the mechanics and risks of sexuality, we often leave them to figure out the workings of love on their own.\n\nAs I\u2019ve since discussed with my mother, rarely does anyone tell young women what it\u2019ll be like when you first fall for someone\u2014and they, in turn, fall for you. Rarely does anyone tell you how overwhelming that will be, and how you\u2019ll do anything to hold on to that feeling. Beyond discussing sexual health\u2014and, now, rape culture\u2014rarely are we preparing our daughters to trust themselves emotionally, and to take their own agency sexually.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m personally grateful that a show like Grown-ish exists for this generation. Because as a member of several older generations of folks who often seem to lack the emotional intelligence to have productive, mutually respectful relationships, I think that maybe these are the conversations we need to be having.", "keywords": ["weeks", "mothers", "daughters", "sexual", "shed", "leave", "rarely", "rainbow", "love", "right", "sexuality", "emotional", "grownish", "talk", "mother"], "polarity": 0.15486830357142856, "subjectivity": 0.5726875},

Riley was right there.\n\n\n\nOf course, Barack was looking at wife Michelle, the woman he loves. Meanwhile, Riley was gazing out at a room full of women he loves, including longtime former boss Oprah Winfrey. The year was 2005, and Riley was producing the Legends Ball at Oprah\u2019s custom-built private Santa Barbara, Calif., estate, appropriately named \u201cthe Promised Land.\u201d\n\nThis, and many equally fabulous and intimate moments like it, reflect the impact of women\u2014especially black women\u2014on Riley\u2019s life. After 30 years in television, as a producer for both Oprah\u2019s and Wendy Williams\u2019 talk shows, he is now the author of the new book That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me. Riley says that our former president\u2019s words echo the feeling he has held for black women since he was \u201cin the womb.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s book is a tale of growing up different. His father was in the Air Force, moving his family to far-flung locales like Tokyo before eventually settling in Valdosta, Ga., in the 1970s. Growing up an oft-uprooted military brat and trying to fit in was not easy, especially as a gay child in a place and time that was not so accepting.\n\nThankfully, Riley had a mother who understood how to nourish her son\u2019s soul with outings to the opera and symphony. But while mother and son shared many conversations about culture, \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was still the unspoken word at home. Instead, Riley found companionship and validation in the songs and stage talents of women he admired. Listening to divas uplifted him and led him to find a path to both himself and the #BlackGirlMagic heaven he dreamed of finding. He would be their angel.\n\nWomen in the arts and entertainment were the muses from my childhood who made me feel better when I was an unsure little boy who didn\u2019t quite know how to live in his truth. These women could tear my heart out with a melody or a soliloquy in a movie, appealing to the outcast I sometimes felt like in my search for acceptance.\n\nThe black gay man\u2019s search for acceptance is a timely conversation, as evidenced by last week\u2019s controversy after Patti LaBelle revealed to Bravo TV\u2019s Andy Cohen that Luther Vandross\u2019 decision to remain closeted all of his life was so as not to disappoint his mother. It\u2019s a subject that touches Riley deeply. Although his own mother understood that her son might be gay, there was a deafening silence on the matter between the two of them. To spare her feelings, Riley chose not to come out until after his mother\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in this current political climate is a reversal of empathy,\u201d Riley says. It\u2019s the reason that he feels the timing is right for this memoir, despite print being on a sharp decline, with even celebrity-centric books struggling to make it into the hands of readers hungry for content about black life.\n\nDorpie Books, the publisher of That\u2019s What Friends Are For, is a black-owned and -operated imprint and a new model of publishing that puts the power in the hands of the audience, allowing them to crowdfund the projects they want to read. It addresses a dire need for publishers to print and promote books by authors of color\u2014one recently expressed by celebrity and new author Gabrielle Union.\n\nThis coming-of-age story features both jewels of personal wisdom and gems from the entertainment world. Riley\u2019s memories illuminate the kindness and humanity of stars from Lena Horne to Beyonc\u00e9, while bringing to light the questions and struggles of many in the LGBTQ community with tenderness and humor. In this excerpt, Riley recounts:\n\nBy high school, I had the jaded notion that there was a hard road ahead that maybe I couldn\u2019t handle, reconciling my insides to what was going on outside. I wondered if I would ever come out as a gay man. Would I continue to go the course that society wanted me to? Could I marry a woman? These were big questions I had to start asking myself while peers were taking next steps into their intimate relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually Riley did fall in love\u2014with the friendship he perceived between Patti Labelle and Dionne Warwick while watching Sisters in the Name of Love, the 1986 AIDS fundraising concert they hosted on HBO with fellow diva Gladys Knight. What he saw between them on-screen became his real-life standard for what friends should be to one another and the good that friendship can bring into the world.\n\nIt was a crush that would become a career. \u201cBefore I knew it, there I was in the TV business, either interviewing my favorite celebrity women or producing their projects,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pages of That\u2019s What Friends Are For read like a producer\u2019s personal diary of Hollywood glitterati, filled with behind-the-scenes photos and very personal anecdotes about the strong women, from activists to athletes, who helped light his journey to both personal and professional success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley\u2019s prose sparkles when he describes the \u201cenergy that comes off of Beyonc\u00e9 or Janet Jackson when I touch their hand to greet them,\u201d and he recounts so many priceless moments, like Queen Bey singing him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on a trip to Manila, Philippines; or the interview he landed with the Boss Miss Ross and Motown founder Berry Gordy at the opening night of Broadway\u2019s Motown the Musical. And then there are the poignant ones, like when he shared tears with Warwick over the tragic loss of her little cousin, singer Whitney Houston.\n\nAt the core of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me lies a highly personal mission: \u201cIf just one gay kid can find a spot of inspiration in this text, along with others who can give support to the LGBTQ community, my efforts will have been worth it.\u201d Because after all, that\u2019s what friends are for.\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Preorders of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me are available now through Dec. 22 at Dorpie Books ($35):\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["riley", "thats", "patrick", "inspire", "meet", "women", "legendary", "bffs", "personal", "black", "friends", "books", "mother", "gay"], "polarity": 0.17496914121914128, "subjectivity": 0.4576360126360127},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do.

So to find that the fingerprints of coal lobbyist-turned-ENRD acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Wood are on an environmental-racism scandal is, actually, pretty par for the course with the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency found elevated levels (pdf) of arsenic, lead and carcinogenic hydrocarbons\u2014courtesy of a nearby coking plant\u2014near 35th Avenue in the black neighborhood of North Birmingham, Ala. The EPA established the neighborhood as a Superfund site, a class of highly polluted areas where contributions from culpable polluters and the government pay for cleanup. In 2013 the EPA and the original offender, Walter Coke, argued that four other companies were also likely responsible for the pollution, including two clients of nearby law firm Balch & Bingham: Drummond and ABC Coke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the next two years, the agency pushed to add the site to its National Priorities List, or NPL\u2014which would have granted more authority to require those implicated to fund cleanup initiatives. It also proposed extending testing to Tarrant, a neighborhood a mile northeast of 35th Avenue. Pushback from business interests and politicians was swift and fierce: In 2014, then-Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange argued that the state wouldn\u2019t provide any funding for the cleanup, and in 2015, Drummond and Balch & Bingham sued the EPA (pdf).\n\nThen an unlikely ally emerged for Balch & Bingham\u2019s clients: Oliver Robinson. The charismatic basketball player-cum-58th District congressman had long been involved in the local community through his galas celebrating black achievement and his charity, the Robinson Foundation. Now he was striking a markedly different tone.\n\nSpearheading a horseshit-sandwich campaign contradicted by EPA evidence, Robinson argued that the soil testing would lower property values. His daughter helped stoke distrust in the feds, sending out dissuading emails and erecting signs urging folks to \u201cGet Smart Tarrant\u2014Don\u2019t Let EPA Fool You!\u201d Ultimately, the NPL proposal died. The implicated companies have yet to contribute to the cleanup, and Robinson resigned last year\u2014but not before taking bribes and implicating Wood, the acting assistant attorney general entrusted with protecting the environment, in a scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter an investigation by two agencies, Robinson entered a plea agreement June 22 on charges of conspiracy, bribery and fraud for using his nonprofit to funnel a $134,000 payment from Balch & Bingham and $30,000 from Alabama Power\u2014a subsidiary of Southern Co., one of the largest and most politically powerful coal-dependent utility groups, and Balch & Bingham\u2019s biggest client.\n\nDuring that time, Balch & Bingham\u2019s point lobbyist for Southern Co. and Alabama Power was a brilliant partner by the name of Jeffrey Wood. Before that, in 2014, Wood was also counsel for Alabama Sen. and Keebler elf-turned-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nNow, as acting assistant attorney general of the ENRD, Wood has the job of enforcing laws related to the environment, natural resources, health and pollution\u2014prosecuting environmental crimes and defending against lawsuits challenging environmental protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Wood was lobbying a week before assuming the ENRD job on Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration day might sound as if it violates Monsieur Great Again\u2019s marquee, swamp-draining ban on former lobbyists taking positions that give them oversight over their old lobbying interests. In practice, Wood was simply recused from presiding over issues (pdf) related to several dozen firms, companies and cases\u2014including, specifically, the North Birmingham Superfund site.\n\nIn fact, Wood\u2014Balch & Bingham\u2019s go-to Southern lobbyist\u2014was specifically recused from touching the Superfund site, and during his tenure at the law firm, he was one of its few lobbyists with Superfund policy expertise. Shortly after the Robinsons\u2019 campaign, he even shifted to lobbying on Superfund policies on Capitol Hill.\n\nTo be legally safe here, none of this is to say that Wood had direct involvement in Robinson\u2019s misinformation campaign or bribery. Robinson acknowledged taking bribes from a partner, but that partner remains unnamed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root reached out to Wood and several of his associates from his tenure with Sessions and Balch & Bingham, but the only response, after we were redirected to the law firm\u2019s public relations person, was, \u201cEach of our lobbyists file registrations describing their lobbying activities,\u201d a reference back to the very lobbying disclosure forms we hyperlinked in an email to them.\n\n\n\nLuckily, we might soon find out more about the extent of Wood\u2019s involvement. After Balch & Bingham was dragged before a federal grand jury in March, and Robinson specifically mentioned working with one of their partners, there\u2019s sure to be a follow-up.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Trump-Russia investigation\u2019s special counsel is looking into Balch & Bingham and Wood, thanks to K.B. Forbes, leader of the advocacy group Consejo de Latinos Unidos, or CDLU. He publicized the law firm\u2019s ties to Black Hall, a Russian-linked aerospace company (which was originally going to host the rally where Sessions endorsed Trump). Afterward, Balch & Bingham\u2019s website and the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the lobbyist who successfully changed Russia sanctions on Mi-17 helicopters\u2014Black Hall\u2019s bread and butter\u2014were scrubbed of all mention of the company.\n\nIn response, Forbes submitted his research to special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee, who are currently reviewing Balch & BIngham\u2019s affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, we\u2019re left with just results of a smell test: Something smells like arsenic, aromatic hydrocarbons and bullshit, and it could be that the man charged with prosecuting on behalf of the environment is complicit in a scandal of economic and environmental racism, and boasts sprawling conflicts of interest that could ensure many of his energy- and utilities-related decisions turn a profit for old employers.", "keywords": ["robinson", "lobbying", "jeffrey", "bingham", "environmental", "wood", "general", "bull", "assistant", "eau", "cologne", "superfund", "attorney", "racism", "epa", "binghams", "balch"], "polarity": 0.13269841269841268, "subjectivity": 0.44953093203093203},

For many of us, this statement, albeit true, often lacks the full context and explanation of how both offensive terms are still derived from white supremacy, colonization and systems of oppression that create pseudo-hierarchies within marginalized populations.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite context, it is still my truth that as black queer people, we have a real fear of the state and of our own community. However, the role that colonization plays in blacks\u2019 assimilation into white society can\u2019t be dismissed as the reason we struggle to find safety within our community. We were colonized to follow the respectable order of white society, pipelined into a system already in place as a means to our own survival. The structure of white supremacy places white hetero men above white hetero women, who are above white LGB people, who are above white transgender people. This, in most cases has been adopted by our community and used to set up a black hierarchy that places black queer lives in danger.\n\n\n\nFor black LGBTQ folks, we sit at the bottom of that pyramid in our community, with black trans women being the most oppressed group. Murders against the trans community have reached an all-time high. On Nov. 29, Brooklyn BreYanna became the 27th black trans woman to be killed this year.\n\nThis is a real problem within our communities.\n\nWith no reform around toxic masculinity\u2014and an entrenched refusal to have hard conversations that are necessary to free us all\u2014we have failed to create safe environments for trans people not only to exist but also to thrive as valuable members of society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiovanni Melton, 14, was recently murdered by his father for being gay. It is a story that shook black LGBTQ folks to the core, a reminder that many of us survived. This story brought home many feelings that black LGBTQ people feel as soon as they walk out the house in the morning and, in this case, before they can even get out of bed.\n\nI was sold a false narrative. I was told \u201cit gets better,\u201d as if becoming an adult would change the years of ridicule I had endured my entire life, and introduce me to a world that would be fully accepting of my gender and sex identity. At 32, I now know that I take my life in my hands when I dress a certain way, or have mannerisms not accepted by a masculine-centered society. I\u2019ve been called a faggot walking to the gym, walking to the train, on Twitter, in the comments of my articles, by people of shared melanin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that it\u2019s all part of a conditioning process, which has taught us to oppress those who can\u2019t easily assimilate into whiteness. In the world we inhabit, those of us who aren\u2019t so-called respectable Negroes are always frantically trying to outrun death\u2014and too many of us lose. Those of us who cloak ourselves in the mantle of respectability are always surprised when the noose encircles their necks.\n\nDespite the lies we\u2019ve been force-fed, America has and will never see the Negro as a person worthy of respect; the condemnation of our own will inevitably hurt any chance we have of ever reaching collective freedom, a freedom that the state works to deny us on a daily basis. The state\u2019s relentless attempts to harm marginalized people using various systems of oppression, instead of one fatal blow, leads to death by a thousand paper cuts. These cuts come even harder for queer people as we deal with an intersection of identities that creates multiple oppressive systems that continue to harm us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHIV funding is being threatened because the face has become that of the black women and black gay men. Conversely, the opioid epidemic is considered a national health crisis because of the white bodies it primarily harms.\n\nApproval of gay marriage only brought about the affirmation of people living in that chosen identity, as they refuse to pass ENDA, which would protect us from job discrimination.\n\nThe socioeconomic status of queer black people leaves too many of us underpaid in positions similar to those of our white counterparts; yet even as homelessness continues to be a critical issue for those who are black and LGBTQ, it continues to largely be ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no \u201cAmerican dream\u201d that has ever envisioned black people as being a part of the narrative. And, if for one moment, we ever allow ourselves to believe in that dream, like Martin Luther King\u2019s realization in 1967\u2014one year before his assassination\u2014we eventually wake up to a nightmare.\n\nHashtag after hashtag, march after march, I am reminded that my blackness is a threat to the state and has been so since our kidnapping to these shores over 400 years ago. Mass incarceration continues to destroy black and brown families in such brutal ways that it seems impossible that our communities will ever fully recover.\n\nWith the continued radical diligence of committed activists, there will be a collective community transformation centered in the truth that #BlackLivesMatter must include those lives which fall outside the margins of heteronormative safety and acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealth care disparities and discrimination have kept our people uninsured, unhealthy and unwilling to trust a medical system built on us remaining that way. Cops, prosecutors, judges and laws continue to perpetuate an injustice system intent on killing black bodies on camera with no resulting consequences beyond GoFundMe payouts, early retirements and not guilty verdicts over and over again. The recent Michael Slager verdict may be an extraordinarily rare example of justice being served, but as Malcolm X said: \u201cIf you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, there\u2019s no progress. If you pull it all the way out that\u2019s not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven\u2019t even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound. They won\u2019t even admit the knife is there.\u201d\n\nNo, they still won\u2019t even admit the knife is there.\n\nThe state tells us that Korryn Gaines and Sandra Bland were too loud and had it coming, that Philando Castile did everything right but wasn\u2019t white, and that Freddie Gray apparently killed himself. Lash after lash we take as black folks from the state, but we are conditioned to believe that if we can live to 80 or 90 years old in oppression, then we had a long, wonderful life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow envision living that life at the intersection of blackness and queerness.\n\nHaving the understanding that this is all a byproduct of white supremacy doesn\u2019t make me any less fearful of my community. However, it does make me hopeful that, with the continued radical diligence of committed activists, there will be a collective community transformation centered in the truth that #BlackLivesMatter must include those lives that fall outside the margins of heteronormative safety and acceptance.\n\n\n\nLiving in my truth as a black queer person comes with the understanding that I may also be quickening my death. For that, I know that submitting to the conditions of white supremacy is not an option, and that it\u2019s worth the fight to heal my own community\u2019s conditioning in an attempt at collective freedom.

They said, \u2018You won\u2019t hit us, you won\u2019t hit us,\u2019 and they started to surround me,\u201d Cerfalo told the news station, adding that the incident started when he shouted at the kids to get out of the road because they were blocking traffic.\n\n\u201cHe touched me and I lifted my hand out, and I ended up hitting him. It was not my intention to hit anybody that hard; it was not my intention to knock teeth out or do harm, or cause any kind of trouble,\u201d Cerfalo added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause, you know, striking out hard at a 12-year-old definitely falls into the \u201cnot causing any kind of harm or trouble\u201d territory.\n\n\n\nThe children refute Cerfalo\u2019s claim, saying that no one touched him at any point during the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to jail, nothing is happening to him, and he\u2019s basically getting away with it right now,\u201d Malikai said.\n\nSince the altercation has gained increased attention, the Charlotte County Sheriff\u2019s Office has released a statement saying that the case would be handed over to the state attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThe statement read in part:\n\nThe investigation of the incident included statements of multiple witness, many of whom were present and had varying levels of involvement in the altercation. The deputies on scene determined one of the juveniles involved was responsible for the altercation. Due to conflicting witness statements, it was determined the best course of action was to send the complete report to the State Attorney\u2019s Office for review. The reporting deputy further requested the State Attorney approve a summons request for one of the juveniles on a charge of assault.\n\nI am certain the deputies on scene investigated this incident in good faith the night it occurred. My goal as your Sheriff is that the community shares the same certainty. As such, I have directed members of our Investigations Division to review the evidence and statements obtained in this case and to work with the State Attorney\u2019s Office directly to examine all aspects of the incident.

Richmond, Democrat from New Orleans and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote a three-page letter Wednesday to Donald Trump declining his invitation to the CBC to meet with him, and outlining the many reasons the group as a whole is saying no.\n\nIn a letter dated June 21 (pdf), Richmond opened by acknowledging the president\u2019s recent request to meet with the CBC:\n\nIn written communication dating back to January 2017, we have shared the priorities of the Caucus as they relate to the Black community. We are serious about the work of advancing the interests of our people and the goals of the CBC. As a result, we took advantage of every opportunity to educate you on the needs of the Black community and provide you with the information and solutions necessary to act on them in good faith. Through an objective assessment, we have seen no evidence that your Administration acted on our calls for action, and we have in fact witnessed steps that will affirmatively hurt Black communities. While we agreed to explore possible future discussions when we first met, it has become abundantly clear that a conversation with the entire CBC would not be entirely productive, given the actions taken by your Administration since our first meeting. While you can solicit the engagement of individual members of our caucus, the CBC as a caucus declines your invitation to meet at this time.\n\nRichmond noted that in March, the CBC presented Trump with a 130-page policy document in order to educate him and his administration on the difficult history of black people in the United States, the history of the CBC and solutions that could help advance black families in the 21st century. The Trump administration has both failed to respond to the policies the CBC outlined and neglected to follow through on its pledge to facilitate meetings between the CBC and relevant Cabinet officials, Richmond said.\n\nIn other words, Trump and his administration have only paid lip service to addressing the needs of black people in the U.S. and never intended to follow through on any of the empty promises that have been made thus far.\n\nIn fact, as Richmond outlined, the administration has acted in opposition to the policy initiatives the caucus has supported, proposing budget cuts to programs that serve low- and moderate-income people, including a $4 billion cut to Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college; and the complete elimination of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \u201cwhich helps seniors and other helpless populations heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the letter, Richmond added:\n\nMoreover, your administration has taken actions that cause legitimate alarm among members of this caucus and the millions of Americans we represent. In a two-page document, your Attorney General issued guidance to federal prosecutors to accelerate the failed war on drugs that will continue to wreck the Black community and exacerbate our nation\u2019s scourge of mass incarceration. Attorney General Sessions has also explicitly stated his unwillingness to utilize consent decrees to protect the civil rights of Americans and has called for an agency-wide review of these agreements. These shortsighted decisions represent willful ignorance by relying on ideology instead of data and compassion. Every dollar we spend on incarceration renders our communities less safe.\n\nIn other words, we see your boy implementing and creating policies that specifically and disproportionately target the black community at large, and this is not a game, Mr. President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Richmond continued, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has caused a number of HBCUs to lose critical funding through the \u201cTRiO\u201d programs (a reference to a number of federal programs intended to help economically disadvantaged students) (pdf), she has refused to protect children from being discriminated against, and she terminated an Obama administration program focused on improving school diversity and student achievement in the lowest-performing schools across the country.\n\nOf course, these atrocities pale in comparison with the decimation of our nation\u2019s health care system. Richmond noted that black people make up 13.3 percent of the U.S. population but 19 percent of Medicaid enrollees, and would therefore be dealt a painful blow by \u201cmean[-spirited]\u201d legislation proposed under the Trump administration.\n\nRichmond went on to outline eight times the CBC has sent written letters to Trump himself and members of his administration, letters that have thus far gone unanswered, because clearly neither the president nor anyone who works for him truly cares about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond concluded, \u201cGiven the lack of response to any of the main concerns we have raised with you and your Administration, we decline your invitation for all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to meet with you. The CBC, and the millions of people we represent, have a lot to lose under your Administration. I fail to see how a social gathering would benefit the policies we advocate for. The CBC will always be willing to engage in discussion and debate about policies and programs that will make America a more perfect union for all.\u201d\n\nIn other words, fuck your photo ops and bullshit promises.\n\nCedric Richmond had the words and the tact to say what we are all thinking in a much nicer way than the president deserves, but he was also direct, pointed and full of facts, and called Trump out for being full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe, \u201cthe blacks,\u201d are tired of the empty promises of the American dream and the \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d We need results that benefit us as much as they benefit those who hold privilege over us.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nEither shit or get off the pot, Donald Trump.", "keywords": ["dont", "words", "members", "congressional", "policies", "richmond", "black", "caucus", "administration", "cbc", "programs", "trump", "care"], "polarity": 0.03136604136604137, "subjectivity": 0.4895652290096733},

He first won our hearts with his memorable performances on Project Runway, where he threw shade like no other and cut his way to the top, one fierce and fabulous frock at a time. Now in his 10th year as head of his own label, the most successful graduate of the Project Runway franchise has built his success on dressing women of all colors, shapes and sizes and fully diversifying his runway presentations into inspirational, aspirational and attainable symbols of beauty and style.\n\nThough Siriano himself is as petite as they come, he knows that the fashion struggle is real for people whose proportions, personalities or orientations are not the \u201cnorm\u201d on the retail floor or red carpet. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure. Both were there to applaud the 10th year of his superluxe ready-to-wear collection.\n\nBut Siriano\u2019s work just isn\u2019t for the rich and famous; we can all walk in designer shoes from the collection he personally designs for Payless, or slide into a sheath from his ongoing collaboration with plus-size retailer Lane Bryant.

Even the suits were lush\u2014made of velvet embedded with tiny crystals, which struck the perfect balance between flashy details and froufrou femininity \u2014something that I\u2019m all for, by the way\u2014especially when those elements are rendered with witty restraint and a sophisticated silhouette.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrange Is the New Black\u2019s Danielle Brooks walks the runway for Christian Siriano.

From the moment Trump was inaugurated, we have borne witness to the ways in which his presidency has negatively affected our lives.\n\n\n\nFrom instituting a Muslim ban to emboldening and supporting white supremacists; from banning transgender people from serving in the military to ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, it\u2019s clear to anyone looking that this administration isn\u2019t acting in the best interests of marginalized communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaShawn Usher is on a beautiful mission to push back against Trump\u2019s dangerous agenda as the founder and executive director of the Mobilizing Our Brothers Initiative. MOBI is a series of curated connectivity events for black gay and queer men to see their holistic selves. The mission of MOBI is to cultivate black and brown gay and queer men through MOBItalks, a three-part personal- and professional-development series starting in three locations in New York City: Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem.\n\n\n\nThe first of those events, \u201cMOBItalks: Brooklyn,\u201d is taking place Saturday and will feature world-renowned journalist and Native Son founder Emil Wilbekin; Real World: Philly alum, philanthropist and television host Karamo Brown; and social commentator, writer and Reparations-podcast co-host Richard Brookshire.\n\n\u201cOur biggest thing is around visibility of black gay men and being unapologetic about that,\u201d Usher tells The Root. \u201cWhen you think about the absence of [an] LGBTQ page on the [White House] website, when you think about the removal of ... other previous administrative initiatives, it\u2019s almost as if this unsaid thing happened. How do we operate in an era of Trump? How do we write grants about being a gay man? This is not a time to be silent, but more of a time to be active, vocal and show more visibility.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many gay black men, promoting the concept of visibility is a double-edged sword because it often forces those who are marginalized to be seen for the sake of empowerment. But such advocacy often fails to fully consider what visibility can mean for their personal safety. This is less of a concern for people like Usher, though. \u201cI don\u2019t think about a balance yet because we haven\u2019t always been visible. There have not always been sections in our community that have been visible, and there are many parts that have been more silent historically,\u201d he says.\n\nKaramo Brown says that MOBI is important because it will provide a space for gay black men, especially under a Trump administration, in which multiple parts of their intersectional identities are under attack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the South the past five months, and I didn\u2019t think white people would be as comfortable calling me a nigger as they were. Racist folks have been so emboldened to be so even more,\u201d Brown tells The Root. \u201cWe have a man tacitly giving permission [for white people] to feel the anger white people have always felt. We need MOBI\u2014where people are sharing space with each other and uplifting each other.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown says that MOBI is also critical to show what positive holistic health can look like. \u201cIt\u2019s an initiative centered on mental health for black queer men,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe in the power of prayer, but I also believe that God has given some of us the ability to be mental-health experts, and we should seek services as well as prayer.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Brown underscores the ways in which black queer men are negatively depicted in the media, and he wanted to help challenge that thinking by being more involved with black organizations.\n\n\u201cWhen I first finished Real World: Philly, I was only approached by white queer organizations, but there is something about coming home. I\u2019m appreciative of the LGBTQ community, but when we start talking about black and brown people, there is something different about our experience that differs from our white counterparts,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThere is something powerful about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMOBI is not alone in its journey of empowering black gay men to speak on behalf of ourselves. There are media outlets like Slay.TV, mentorship and scholarship programs like Black, Gifted & Whole, which provides resources to black gay men enrolled in HBCUs; and Native Son, a safe space to empower black gay men and celebrate achievements in multiple fields. For Wilbekin, the founder of Native Son, MOBI is a revolutionary act.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re living within challenging, ignorant political times, it is important to mobilize ourselves. It is important to strengthen each other and uplift each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look at DACA, the transgender U.S. military ban, we know [Trump] doesn\u2019t care. We have the power to come together in community together and finding intersections where we\u2019re marginalized and create a force and stand up against this man. This feels like community organization and grassroots movements, but really, it is healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMOBItalks: Brooklyn\u201d happens Saturday at Ilan Rubin Studio; \u201cMOBItalks: Bronx\u201d will be held Oct. 7 at the Bronx Museum of Art; and \u201cMOBItalks: Harlem\u201d will take place Oct. 21 at 213 E. 121st St.", "keywords": ["white", "tackle", "initiative", "mobilizing", "queer", "trumps", "mobi", "black", "think", "brothers", "mobitalks", "empowering", "america", "brown", "trump", "men", "gay"], "polarity": 0.08801652892561983, "subjectivity": 0.42117003367003375},

However, one of the other students decided to bring the conversation up with the homeroom teacher, who then fixed her mouth to say some dumb shit.\n\nShe actually opened her mouth and apparently said, \u201cAt least she didn\u2019t call you a dumb, black nigger,\u201d according to the Fraziers.\n\n\u201cThe thing that really really shocked me was when the teacher leans into the girls and she kind of caressed my daughter\u2019s face and says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a beautiful girl, but at least she didn\u2019t call you a dumb, black and the \u2018n\u2019 word. \u2026 When my daughter told me that, I was completely shocked,\u201d Nathan Frazier said to WTVM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family reached out to the school\u2019s principal for a sit-down.

From a black actor winning for the first time in decades in the drama category to a black comedian winning in a comedy series directed and written by all black people, one could say that the event was the most inclusive and representative of black people in the 69 years of the show.\n\n\n\nThe real highlight of the night came when Lena Waithe won her award for comedy writing, becoming the first black woman in the history of the Emmys to ever win in that category. What made the win so special for many was knowing that Waithe utilized elements of her own coming-out experience in co-writing the \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode that won in that category for the show Master of None.\n\n\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Waithe not only called on the need to go beyond diversity conversation topics in entertainment, but also went on to make a special mention of her \u201cLGBTQIA family,\u201d specifically making mention of the fact that we need to be more visible and vocal about the right for LGBTQIA people to exist.\n\n\n\nThe problem?\n\n\n\nAlmost every news media outlet acknowledged her black identity first while only mentioning her queer identity as an afterthought. For folks like myself, who see both a person\u2019s queer and black identity as synonymous, I was left to wonder why media outlets often acknowledge the greatness that is, in fact, being black, but rarely acknowledge the beauty that is being both black and queer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember once having a colleague who identified as both black and queer tell me that she often felt like she had to choose between her black and queer identity. She shared with me that once a white co-worker asked her if she was \u201cblack today or queer today,\u201d making it seem that her identity as a queer black cisgender woman was something that could be selected like puzzle pieces.\n\nHearing this, it made me think about the work that black scholars Jamie Washington and Vernon Wall have done around the both/and, and/or complex (pdf). Both scholars explain that often black queer people are made to feel as if they aren\u2019t whole and will have to choose one identity over another in order to feel recognized or validated in certain spaces.\n\n\n\nThe bigger issue: On most days, black queer people are often forced to live between the lines of their marginalized identity, being made to feel as if they are too black to be queer or too queer to be black. When society or media fails to recognize black identity and queer identity as being synonymous, we further marginalize their existence. As Corin Peterson stated, most queer black people will spend most of their lives never feeling completely accepted, being caught in the middle of their intersecting identities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I find to be even more interesting in times like these is how both media and society use the word intersectionality (pdf), coined by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, but will often leave out the oppressive and discriminatory ways in which we treat black people when we begin discussing one\u2019s queer identity.\n\n\n\nWhen we address Lena Waithe as just a black woman who briefly mentioned her queer identity, or tell black people that they should leave their sexuality out of public discourse, then we begin to embrace the dangerous elements of identity politics, which often add to the oppression of black queer individuals.\n\nFurther, we begin to perpetuate this idea that there is no need to recognize the intersections of black queer people\u2019s identity (specifically, black women) and that one identity takes precedence over the other. As Crenshaw stated, this leads to treating race, gender and other identity categories as \u201cvestiges of bias.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all, we have to challenge mainstream media to start seeing black queer people as whole. Regardless of what you might believe, every person deserves the right to be seen as a full individual. We must challenge the notion that someone should have to choose between their racial and sexual identity because Audre Lorde tells us that regardless of how we identify, we are all complicated people leading complicated lives.\n\n\n\nIf we can celebrate and embrace Ellen DeGeneres fully in both her white and queer identity for all the work she has done for the LGBTQIA community, then Lena Waithe deserves to be celebrated for all the work she has done just by being visible and forthcoming about both her racial and sexual identity.", "keywords": ["woman", "lena", "work", "reminder", "need", "lgbtqia", "queer", "waithe", "black", "media", "identity"], "polarity": 0.05938654841093859, "subjectivity": 0.4797038327526132},

You\u2019re probably thinking that some white supremacist, Confederacy-loving Caucasian finally got a chance to fulfill his lifelong wet dream of owning niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNope\u2014it\u2019s a black guy.\n\nAccording to the Clarion-Ledger, Curtis Bordenave\u2014a branding consultant residing in Columbus, Miss.\u2014was the first applicant since the Supreme Court struck down a federal law in June that excluded derogatory terms from being trademarked or patented. Bordenave had tried to undercut the law in 2008 by trademarking \u201cnig\u201d and \u201cg-ga,\u201d but his application for \u201cnig\u201d was denied.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. This dude literally tried to put \u201cnigga\u201d on layaway. Isn\u2019t that an R. Kelly song? I distinctly remember him singing \u201clet\u2019s go haaalf on a niiiggaaa ... ,\u201d but I might be wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe would have been the first to acquire the mark within the law, which we thought was fantastic and fascinating and thoughtful,\u201d Bordenave said. \u201cWe were sour about that. We felt that we were cut out of an opportunity to create a brand that would have changed the whole meaning of this word.\u201d\n\nBordenave\u2019s application was soon followed by Steven Maynard of Snowflake Enterprises LLC, who filed to trademark the swastika because ... wypipo.\n\nThese developments have led me to prepare a few of my own applications, which include:\n\nKentucky Fried Unseasoned Chicken: For the Caucasians who show up at the cookout.\n\nCracka Ass Crackers: For white people who think saltines are too spicy. Wypipo Wipes: When you realize you\u2019re full of shit, but white fragility leaves you butt-hurt. No More White Tears: Theme song: \u201cI\u2019m going to wash that hate right out of my hair!\u201d Becky Spray: A variation of Mace that repels white women.\n\nBordenave\u2019s \u201cnigga\u201d brand will apply to clothing, games, accessories, fragrances, charitable fundraising, humor and comedic performances, television show production, bumper stickers, campaign buttons and mobile apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause the word is such a well-known word without a brand, without a logo, it actually has the ability to become a famous mark almost instantly,\u201d he said. \u201cOur message is bigger than our brand. Our message is, \u2018Every shade, every gender unite.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf I had written this story at any other time, I would have concluded it with \u201cthis nigga ... \u201d\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to get sued for trademark infringement.\n\nRead more at the Clarion-Ledger.", "keywords": ["brand", "word", "man", "white", "trademarked", "application", "nword", "law", "youre", "black", "tried", "nigga", "trademark"], "polarity": 0.05495522995522995, "subjectivity": 0.45853683353683355},

And while many network executives seem to have gotten the memo about diversity\u00ad\u2014except, apparently, CBS, whose president has already apologized for its lily-white lineup of new shows\u2014some of the most inclusive shows with black storylines and black actors in leading roles are found on cable networks. Case in point: OWN\u2019s Queen Sugar and FX\u2019s Atlanta have already captured sizable followings, proving once again that our stories can attract an audience.\n\nBut there are some new broadcast shows, as well as new shows on cable and Netflix, featuring black actors as more than just sidekicks that we think are really worth watching.\n\n\n\n1. Issa Rae finds the funny in being Insecure.\n\nShow: Insecure\n\nWhen: Sundays, 10:30 p.m.; premieres Oct. 9 on HBO.\n\nWhy you should watch: We\u2019ve followed the amazing Issa Rae ever since her web series, The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl, became an internet sensation. Shades of that show live on in her new HBO series, in which Rae plays 20-something Issa Dee, who awkwardly tries to navigate through life, love and friendship in Los Angeles. Much like her web series, Insecure offers a glimpse of blackness in all its complexities to show that we are not a monolith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to convey that people of color are relatable,\u201d Rae said during a Television Critics Association panel to promote the show, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThis is not a hood story. This is about regular people living life.\"\n\n\n\n2. Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage breaks out on his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShow: Luke Cage\n\nWhen: All 13 episodes drop Sept. 30 on Netflix.\n\nWhy you should watch: After playing an all-too-brief love interest in Netflix\u2019s other comic-book series, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage (played by the lovely and talented Mike Colter) gets a chance to tell his origin story. Cage, who has super strength and unbreakable skin, becomes the superhero vigilante Harlem needs as he takes on a crime lord called Cottonmouth, played by the equally lovely and talented Mahershala Ali (House of Cards).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Pitch looks like it could be a hit.\n\nShow: Pitch\n\nWhen: Thursdays, 9 p.m. (although first episode is scheduled for 8:59 p.m.); premieres Sept. 22 on Fox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy you should watch: Kylie Bunbury plays Ginny Baker, the first woman to pitch in the major leagues. Early reviews have been positive, but more importantly, seeing a woman\u00ad\u2014a black woman, at that\u2014in a leading role can really be an inspiration for young girls. The trailers made me think of superstar Mo\u2019Ne Davis, who wowed the Little League world with her pitching skills. Could this one day be her story?\n\n\n\n4. Sterling K. Brown goes from chasing O.J. to This Is Us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShow: This Is Us\n\nWhen: Tuesdays, 10 p.m.; premieres Sept. 20 on NBC.\n\nWhy you should watch: Brown\u2019s performance as Christopher Darden in The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story may have been overshadowed by those of Courtney B. Vance (Johnnie Cochran) and Sarah Paulson (Marcia Clark). But Brown\u2019s sensitive portrayal of the black prosecutor who was labeled an Uncle Tom throughout the O.J. trial humanized Darden and turned him into a sympathetic figure who was a victim of Cochran\u2019s efforts to free his (guilty) client.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown appears to bring that same sensitivity to This Is a Us, a dramedy that features intersecting storylines of several people who share the same birthday. Brown plays a married father who decides to track down his own father, who left him at a fire station as an infant. Critics who\u2019ve seen the show mention a surprise twist that has made this series one of the most buzzed-about shows of the season.\n\n\n\n5. Mariah Carey, Taye Diggs and Phylicia Rashad drop by Empire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShow: Empire\n\nWhen: Wednesdays, 9 p.m.; returns Sept. 21 on Fox.\n\nWhy you should watch: Empire was kind of a hot mess after its super-hot first season. The second season finale ended with a cliffhanger that left us wondering who fell off the terrace: Boo Boo Kitty or Andre\u2019s wife, Rhonda? Since I have no love for either of those characters, who cares? Empire is at its best when Taraji P. Henson\u2019s Cookie Lyon is coming for someone\u2019s neck. Luckily, the addition of Carey, who plays a pop star named Kitty; Taye Diggs, who plays wealthy politician Angelo Dubois (and a love interest for Cookie); and Rashad, who plays Angelo\u2019s bougie mother (Clair Huxtable vs. Cookie? Yes, please), will ensure that Cookie sees plenty of screen time in the new season.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Laverne Cox does the Time Warp as Dr. Frank-N-Furter.\n\nShow: The Rocky Horror Picture Show\n\nWhen: Oct. 20 on Fox.\n\nWhy you should watch: Because Laverne Cox is amazing and she makes everything she\u2019s in better. In this reboot of the cult classic film, she plays the role made famous by Tim Curry, Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the sexually ambiguous mad scientist who entertains guests at a Transylvania science convention for the birth of a muscle-bound boy toy named Rocky Horror.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Damon Wayans Sr. helps reboot the Lethal Weapon franchise.\n\nShow: Lethal Weapon\n\nWhen: Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; premieres Sept. 21 on Fox.\n\nWhy you should watch: While son Damon Jr. was keeping the family name in the spotlight, Papa Wayans was keeping a low profile (except when he popped up to defend Bill Cosby), so it\u2019ll be fun to see what he\u2019ll do as Detective Roger Murtaugh, the role made famous by Danny Glover in the movie. Clayne Crawford (Rectify) plays rogue Detective Martin Riggs, who has nothing left to lose after the death of his wife and unborn child in a car wreck.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Michael Ealy is a suspect in Secret and Lies.\n\nShow: Secrets and Lies\n\nWhen: Sundays, 9 p.m.; returns Sept. 25 on ABC.\n\nWhy you should watch: I didn\u2019t watch the first season of this murder-mystery series starring Juliette Lewis as dogged Detective Andrea Cornell. But the second season features Michael Ealy (who we last saw in The Perfect Guy with Sanaa Lathan) as a husband who becomes the prime suspect when his wife is murdered.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Corey Hawkins plays beat the clock in 24: Legacy.\n\nShow: 24: Legacy\n\nWhen: Premieres Feb. 5 on Fox after the Super Bowl, and then Mondays at 8 p.m.\n\nWhy you should watch: Hawkins, whose breakout performance as Dr. Dre in Straight Outta Compton put him on everyone\u2019s radar, will pick up where Jack Bauer left off. Hawkins is playing an Army Ranger who has to stop a terrorist attack in the United States while also being hunted by a terrorist cell for the assassination of its leader.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Midseason is the new black.\n\nMidseason replacements are those shows that usually come in after the first-tier shows either get canceled or go on early hiatus. For whatever reason, network executives have chosen to put several shows featuring black actors in prominent roles in midseason, which typically runs January through May. Here are a few shows that might be worth waiting for:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShots Fired on Fox\n\nPremise: The story sounds familiar: An unarmed college student is killed by a cop. But the twist is the student is white and the cop is black. And the two Department of Justice officials sent to investigate the shooting\u00ad\u2014played by Sanaa Lathan and Stephan James (Race, Selma)\u2014are also black. The show was created by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Beyond the Lights, Love & Basketball) and her husband, Reggie Rock Bythewood, and if this show were in anyone else\u2019s hands, I\u2019d give it the side eye. But I have faith that the Bythewoods know what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStar on Fox\n\nPremise: Lee Daniels, who gave us Empire, is at it again with another series that focuses on the gritty side of the music business. The show tells the story of Star, a troubled young woman who decides to go to Atlanta with her foster sister and best friend to form a girl group. They meet up with Carlotta (played by Queen Latifah), a surrogate mother from Star\u2019s past. The soundtrack and performances will probably be amazing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoubt on CBS\n\nPremise: Laverne Cox will make a historic appearance as broadcast TV\u2019s first full-time transgender character in this legal drama, starring Katherine Heigl and Dul\u00e9 Hill (Ballers, West Wing).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarlon on NBC\n\nPremise: Comedian Marlon Wayans gets a half-hour family show inspired by his real life. He plays a loving but immature dad who is co-parenting his two children with his ex-wife, played by Essence Atkins.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill Star-Crossed on ABC\n\nPremise: This period drama picks up where Romeo and Juliet left off. But in this scenario, Romeo and Juliet are an interracial couple, and their two families struggle to come to terms after their tragic deaths. The show is produced by Shonda Rhimes, and if anyone can make Shakespeare interesting, she can.", "keywords": ["wait", "season", "series", "sept", "left", "tv", "premieres", "things", "watch", "black", "love", "cant", "shows", "plays"], "polarity": 0.14874763899154142, "subjectivity": 0.4813123416781952},

I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\u201d (video)\n\nTime to Recast World of Decision-Making Machines\n\nFirst, the futurist Amy Webb told the audience of journalists, librarians and foundation managers that they could easily be duped by the ever-growing purveyors of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImages of their faces could be affixed to others\u2019 bodies, their voices to impostors. Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks. Right?\u201d said the author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream: Forecast and Take Action on Tomorrow\u2019s Trends, Today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could spend an entire day showing you examples of all kinds of places in which machine-learning algorithms don\u2019t recognize darker faces, where if you . . . are a non-Native English speaker, it\u2019s difficult for you to be understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary data sets that was used to train a lot of the voice recognition systems came from Philadelphia from the 1990s; there was a series of I think 700 recoded phone calls. If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme.

Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger. What we\u2019re learning is that some of the strongest forms of activism is when you hit a muthafucka in their pockets. Period.

Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it.

Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back.

Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not).

Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray?

However, Moses added that as the editor of the newspaper, with jurisdiction over its editorial pages, she takes responsibility.\n\nSimon Romero reported for the New York Times that the cartoon was \u201cprompting outrage from prominent Democrats and Republicans in the state.\u201d The illustration, by Sean Delonas, \u201cdepicts a white couple being accosted in a back alley by three men. One is holding the couple at gunpoint and taking the woman\u2019s purse. Another is wearing a jacket emblazoned with \u2018MS-13,\u2019 the name of a gang that President Trump and others have repeatedly invoked to denounce illegal immigration. The third has on a ski mask and a suicide vest of smoking explosives.\n\n\u201cThe male victim tells the woman, \u2018Now, honey ... I believe they prefer to be called \u201cDreamers,\u201d \u2018 a reference to young undocumented immigrants predominantly from Latin America, and adds, \u2018Or future Democrats.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cartoon, which was published on Wednesday, quickly elicited criticism around New Mexico, where about 48.5 percent of the population is Hispanic, the highest percentage of any state in the country. Tensions have simmered in the state, which Mr. Trump lost in the 2016 election, over the federal government\u2019s immigration policies. . . . \u201c\n\nRomero also noted Moses\u2019 written apology, in which she said \u201cthat the cartoon \u2018appeared to us to be poking at President Trump\u2019s rhetoric by portraying a quaking Republican couple who were painting Dreamers with a broad, totally false, brush.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Delonas, the cartoonist, said that while he sympathized with Ms. Moses, he disagreed with her assessment of the illustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s not the way I read it,\u2019 said Mr. Delonas, 56, a former cartoonist at The New York Post. \u2018I\u2019ve learned that MS-13 is purposely sending minors over here to commit crimes. I\u2019m pretty sure that the cartels are using minors for a lot of their drug dealing.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nMoses told Journal-isms that she was not aware of previous controversies involving Delonas\u2019 cartoons, but \u201cI am now.\u201d\n\nAfter 23 years at the paper, Delonas took a buyout from the New York Post in 2013, during the Barack Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDuring a long career at the Post, Mr. Delonas was definitely un-PC,\u201d Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke wrote then for the New York Observer. \u201cHis cartoons for the tabloid at times attracted controversy \u2014 like his 2009 cartoon of a [cop] shooting a monkey, while [another cop quips] that they will need to find someone else to write the stimulus bill (prompting cries of racism since Mr. Delonas seemed to be equating a chimp with the president). . . .\u201d\n\nIn a rare move, the Post responded to the outcry by apologizing \u201cto those who were offended by the image.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, after the Associated Press reported on the New York Police Department\u2019s clandestine spying on Muslim communities, for which the AP won a Pulitzer Prize, Delonas depicted three Muslims making bombs in an apartment. Looking out the window at the police, one says, \u201cHello, AP Press? I\u2019d like to register a complaint against the N.Y.P.D. for spying on us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, May Ortega, president of the New Mexico chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, wrote that she was dissatisfied with Moses\u2019 printed apology. \u201cThrough publishing this image, you have failed your community and your staff \u2014 some of whom we represent. We demand a proper apology for publishing this racist image and a retraction of it. And we ask that you implement a better internal system to avoid these kinds of regrettable actions.\u201d\n\nNationally, NAHJ issued a statement Friday saying, \u201cThis morning, NAHJ is able to report a meeting that occurred over the phone with Karen Moses, Editor-in-Chief of the Albuquerque Journal. This critical and sincere conversation included the EIC taking responsibility for the grave error, identified the issue allowing this to happen and laying out the preventative measures the Journal will be putting in place moving forward. . . .\u201d\n\nHowever, Moses told Journal-isms that the telephone call lasted 30 seconds \u2014 \u201cmaybe two minutes\u201d \u2014 and that she did not specify what preventative measures would be taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journal did not participate in the 2017 newsroom diversity survey of the American Society of News Editors.

Their story was produced in collaboration with Univision Chicago, and made available in English and Spanish.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, the police department hired whites and Latinos at rates more than double that of African-Americans, who made up just 17 percent of the total 1,126 new hires,\u201d Stark and Litttle continued.

A Chicago Reporter examination of police hiring data going back to 2013 \u2014 the most complete recruitment records available \u2014 shows that many African-Americans have applied to the force in recent years.

Many applicants who passed the test later dropped out of the process, which includes an extensive background check and physical, psychological and drug tests.\n\n\u201cIn some policing circles, the prevailing sentiment has been that few African-Americans were interested in joining the force.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Donald Trump\u2019s Tumultuous First Year in Office\n\nDonald Trump made it his business to dominate the news cycle as much as possible in 2017, and there is no sign of a change in strategy for 2018.\n\nHis comments on race and religion led journalists of color to confront his press representatives at briefings and to question whether to flat-out call the president a white supremacist. In one of many outrageous examples, from May, then-Press Secretary Sean Spicer demonized Hispanic immigrant teens accused of rape, using the accusation as justification for the president\u2019s campaign against immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turned out that the charges against the teens were dropped. The defense maintained all along that the sex was consensual. The White House was questioned sharply and justifiably about its rush to judgment. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta was often front and center.\n\nThere was the feud between April Ryan, Washington correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, and Omarosa Manigault Newman, who, after rumors that her time was limited, was ousted in December as a White House adviser, effective in 2018. Omarosa\u2019s appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in August proved to be a \u201chot mess\u201d as she clashed with panel moderator Ed Gordon.\n\nRyan was not invited to the White House Christmas Party for the first time in 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was overlooked,\u201d Ryan told the Washington Post. \u201cI think they don\u2019t like me. For whatever reason, they have disdain for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome news organizations, among them the Post and the New York Times, produced a dizzying series of scoops in May about Trump and his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. But black and brown reporters were not on the teams unearthing them.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, attributed the low representation to an industry-wide problem.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough investigative reporters who happen to be African American or Latino,\u201d Baquet said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s demonization of the news media \u2014 calling members \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2014 had worldwide consequences. His insistence on dominating news cycles was not only crowding out other news, but emboldening autocrats elsewhere. The Trump administration was delivering a message, said Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists, that \u201cJournalists are contemptible, and governments that crack down on the media face no consequences in terms of their relationship with the US. . . .\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appeals to white nationalists gave a boost to best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates of the Atlantic, whose public profile rose higher with publication of \u201cThe First White President,\u201d an article excerpted from his book about the Obama era, \u201cWe Were Eight Years in Power.\u201d\n\nNews media efforts to report more on Trump supporters met with pushback from some journalists of color, who argued that news involving voters of color was being sacrificed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time looking at angry white voters,\u201d Nikole Hannah-Jones, a writer for the New York Times Magazine who specializes in racial issues, said at the Online News Association convention in October. \u201cThis is the first election after the [weakening of the] Voting Rights Act and voter suppression. Lots of votes were probably suppressed.\u201d\n\nA study from the battleground state of Wisconsin \u201cestimates 16,800 or more people in Dane and Milwaukee counties were deterred from casting ballots in November because of Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law,\u201d Patrick Marley and Jason Stein reported Sept. 26 for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African Americans and low-income people.\n\nIn the aftermath of Democrat Doug Jones\u2019 upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama\u2019s special December election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, African American voters \u2014 especially African American women \u2014 were credited with saving the day for Jones. Many were surprised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheila Tyson, a member of the Birmingham City Council who is Alabama convener of the nonpartisan National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, told Journal-isms, \u201cno one covered us and what we were doing.\u201d\n\n2. Sexual Harassment Charges Bring Down Powerful\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201csilence breakers\u201d \u2014 women and men who came forward with accusations of sexual harassment \u2014 were Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d and it was appropriate that Tarana Burke, a black woman, was among them. A social activist, Burke first used the hashtag #MeToo more than a decade ago as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault.\n\n\n\nAs with the Trump investigations, black and brown journalists were not prominent among the reporters uncovering misdeeds, but were among the accusers and the accused.\n\nThe accused included talk-show host Tavis Smiley; Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press; BuzzFeed White House correspondent Adrian Carrasquillo; longtime Fox Business anchor Charles Payne; and Francisco Cort\u00e9s, vice president of Fox News for the English-language Fox News Latino website, now stripped of original content. In the Cort\u00e9s case, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement with Fox worth more than $2.5 million in late February, Emily Steel reported for the New York Times in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of these men denied the charges or said they were overblown. A rape charge against Payne is in court. Writing in New York magazine on Dec. 1, Suki Kim disclosed problems that John Hockenberry, host of New York Public Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d who is white, had with black female co-hosts on a show designed to spotlight diversity.\n\nSeparately, veteran Chicago rock critic Jim DeRogatis reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, held as if in a cult. \u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said,\u201d according to Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post.\n\nFinally, Gawker published it. Kelly has insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it, Sullivan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in October for splinternews.com, Michael Arceneaux asked, \u201cWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes?\n\nThe answer may lie in who his victims are. \u201cThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like [Hollywood mogul Harvey] Weinstein and [the late Fox News founder Roger] Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, four female journalists, including former Detroit Free Press photographer Regina Boone, filed a federal lawsuit against the Free Press and its parent company, Gannett, alleging pay discrimination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n3. \u2018Suspension\u2019 of Roland Martin\u2019s \u2018NewsOne Now\u2019\n\nAfter four years, the black-owned TV One cable network pulled \u201cNewsOne Now With Roland Martin,\u201d the only black-oriented daily television news program, saying in a December announcement that it is \u201cworking to restructure NewsOne Now in 2018 under a new format that will better serve its audience and advertisers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision baffled many, especially since the program was expanded from one hour to two in the year\u2019s third quarter. TV One had proclaimed that the show had experienced \u201csix consecutive quarters of growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe staff wrap party for the last episode of NewsOne Now with Roland Martin was not supposed to feel like it did,\u201d Jason Johnson wrote for The Root.\n\n\u201cI walked into the staff kitchen and saw Martin in all of his fuchsia glory, smiling, ascot crisp, happily chopping it up. \u2018What\u2019s up, baby?\u2019 he said, then hit me with a hug like we were at Essence Fest or the Republican convention, not the last day of an award-winning TV show. . . . The more people I talked to, the more obvious it\u2019s became that nobody knew for sure why NewsOne Now was going off the air, but the one thing on which they did agree was that black folks were going to be the worse for it. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. FCC Aligns Itself With Big Media\n\nIn \u201can awful new low\u201d that elicited warnings about \u201ca new wave of media consolidation,\u201d the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rolled back media ownership regulations under the guise of trying \u201cto modernize its broadcast ownership rules & to help promote ownership diversity,\u201d Jessica Corbett wrote Nov. 16 for Common Dreams.\n\n\u201c \u2018Any pretense that this vote will help journalism or increase ownership diversity is cynical and offensive,\u2019 said Free Press president and CEO Craig Aaron, warning that the move will \u2018lead to more mergers, more layoffs, and more communities that have no news outlets in place to cover important stories and hold officials accountable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe approved order:\n\n\u201cEliminates newspaper/broadcast and radio/television cross-ownership rules, which imposed restrictions on owning multiple media outlets in the same market;\n\n\u201cRelaxes rules about local television ownership \u2014 including joint sales agreements, which allow a company to control news operations at several stations in one market, where stations would typically compete against each other; and [formally] requests \u2018comment on how to design and implement\u2019 an FCC diversity incubator program. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe order comes as local news becomes more precious. \u201cAs local newspapers have closed across the country, more and more communities are left with no daily local news outlet at all,\u201d Yemile Bucay, Vittoria Elliott, Jennie Kamin and Andrea Park wrote for the spring 2017 issue of Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nIn December, the FCC scrapped so-called \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content.\n\nStanding with other progressive organizations, the NAACP said it \u201cis staunchly opposed to any attempt to censor or manipulate information on the internet, especially if it creates a barrier to entry for people of color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJournalists of color associations have long opposed media consolidation. In 2014, the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists joined others in a letter opposing joint sales agreements, saying, \u201cThese arrangements have harmed communities of color by leading to the elimination of local newscasts and employment opportunities for journalists of color. Furthermore, they have reduced the opportunities for people of color to own broadcast stations. . . . \u201c\n\nProponents say the arrangements actually save jobs by allowing for financially healthier broadcast companies. Armstrong Williams, the conservative commentator who has benefited from such agreements as owner of Howard Stirk Holdings, wrote in Broadcasting & Cable in December, \u201cbroadcast ownership has permitted Howard Stirk Holdings to create an incubator for African American journalism students by providing tuition scholarships, while providing field experience outside of the classroom. If we were not broadcast owners, I am sure none of that would have been possible. . . .\u201d\n\nAlso at issue is a proposed merger of Sinclair Broadcasting, which owns 193 stations, with Tribune Media, which has 42.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer FCC commissioner Michael Copps \u201csaid the deal would eviscerate local TV news and help inflict \u2018irreparable damage,\u2019 \u201c John Eggerton reported in August for Broadcasting & Cable.\n\n\u201cHe called Sinclair the \u2018most dangerous company most Americans have never heard of.\u2019 He said the company wants to skirt ownership regulations with more \u2018joint evasion agreements.\u2019 He said the company comes with an ideology more focused on conservative points of view than \u2018any sense of balance of deep-dive journalism.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The Numbers\n\nThe news industry enters 2018 approaching the 50th anniversary March 1 of the Kerner Commission report, officially the report of the presidentially appointed National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.\n\nThe examination of the causes of the 1967 urban uprisings said that \u201cfewer than 5 percent of the people employed by the news business in the United States today are Negroes\u201d and that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, the American Society of News Editors\u2019 annual diversity survey of newspapers and online outlets (but not broadcasters) found that journalists of color comprised 16.6 percent of the workforce in responding U.S. newsrooms.\n\nIn local television news, the workforce rose to 24.4 percent people of color, Bob Papper reported in his annual survey for the Radio Television Digital News Association and Hofstra University.\n\n\u201cStill, as far as minorities are concerned, the bigger picture remains unchanged,\u201d Papper wrote. \u201cIn the last 27 years, the minority population in the U.S. has risen 12.1 points; but the minority workforce in TV news is up just over half that at 6.6. And the minority workforce in radio is less than 1 point higher. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMizell Stewart III, then president of the American Society of News Editors, wrote members in May, \u201cThe lack of progress is palpable because the continuing transformation of media business models has led to dramatic reductions in newsroom employment, particularly at local newspapers.\n\n\u201cIn many legacy news organizations, moving the needle on staff diversity took a back seat to the survival of the enterprise. . . .\u201d ASNE is emphasizing diversity at the leadership level with its \u201cEmerging Leaders Institutes.\u201d\n\nStill, there were initiatives as well as setbacks.\n\nNew America Media, which described itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s first and largest collaboration of and advocate for ethnic, community, minority, and bilingual media sources,\u201d closed Nov. 30 after 45 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism said it hopes to fill the gap.\n\nThe Gizmodo Media Group announced that 50 percent of its workforce is of color, and the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, representing the overwhelmingly white alternative press, said it would conduct a demographic survey of newspaper staff. However, African American columnists Barry Saunders of the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and Shaun King of the Daily News in New York, parted company with their employers. (King is now with the Intercept.)\n\nA study from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists excoriated coverage of Latinos on the evening news shows, but the hurricane disaster in Puerto Rico put Latino journalists front and center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication added a new professional program called Cronkite Noticias, a newscast featuring six bilingual journalists who write and broadcast for the Spanish-speaking community in Arizona,\u201d as Alexa Buechler wrote in February for the State Press, the student newspaper at Arizona State University..\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden, former New York Times sports columnist, joined The Undefeated, which began the \u201cRhoden Fellows,\u201d a sports journalism internship program focused on identifying and training aspiring African American journalists from historically black colleges and universities.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, Google partnered with Howard University to launch a school branch on the company\u2019s campus, where undergraduate students will learn from Google engineers in addition to the university\u2019s own faculty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York-based Theatre Communications Group began a theater criticism and journalism track in Rising Leaders of Color, \u201cdesigned to deepen the pool of voices documenting, reflecting, and challenging the field.\u201d\n\nA post-mortem from the Michigan Civil Rights Commission on the Flint water crisis harkened back to the language of Kerner, saying that historic and systemic racism played a role in the public health catastrophe.\n\n\u201cThe limited coverage begs the same question of the media that we ask of decision makers: Would things have been covered differently if it wasn\u2019t Flint? Might the story have led the news, would stories have been more extensive? Most critical, would reporters have pushed government officials to provide acceptable answers? Those who made decisions on what stories to cover and how to do so will doubtlessly insist that race played no part in their decision making, that such factors were not considered at all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Jemele Hill Saga Prompts Warnings About Twitter\n\n\u201cOn Monday, Jemele Hill returns to The Six after a two-week suspension for violating ESPN\u2019s social media policy,\u201d Bryan Curtis wrote on Oct. 22 for theringer.com.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut a key meeting happened Sunday, when Hill sat down with ESPN president John Skipper. According to two sources, the meeting occurred away from the Bristol campus; Hill and Skipper were alone. . . . It was the first time the two met since September 13, two days after Hill called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter and the day that the Trump White House called for her to be fired. As Hill wrote in The Undefeated, she cried during that meeting.\n\n\u201cHill\u2019s suspension is both ESPN bureaucratic intrigue and a national political cause that has been joined by everyone from J.R. Smith to the ACLU. . . .\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 2, Jeremy Barr wrote for the Hollywood Reporter that, \u201cthe network publicly released a new set of social media guidelines that deal with social and political issues. The effort was led by Kevin Merida, the former Washington Post managing editor who runs the ESPN property The Undefeated. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA section of the guidelines deal specifically with commentaries. ESPN employees are told: \u2018Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties. ... We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile Skipper told Sports Business Daily that the guidelines were not released in response to Hill\u2019s case, Hill initially got in trouble for writing on Twitter that Donald Trump is a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which would likely be considered \u2018inflammatory rhetoric\u2019 under the new guidelines. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Ebony\u2019s New Ownership Disappoints\n\nPerhaps no development created more disappointment among black journalists than the unrealized promise of Ebony magazine under its new owner, Clear View Group, a black-owned Texas company.\n\nAlong with Fox News, Ebony was awarded this year\u2019s Thumbs Down Award from the National Association of Black Journalists. NABJ said the magazine \u201chas made headlines this year because of staff cuts; the relocation of its headquarters from its founding base in Chicago to Los Angeles [actually, only editorial offices were relocated there]; and, its very public and sometimes offensive responses to reports of late or non-payment for work already performed by staff or freelance journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Many of the decisions being made by Ebony\u2019s new owners seem counter to the vision of founder John H.

To hear writers whose words bring us much joy aren\u2019t being paid for those words is sad, unconscionable, unacceptable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nEbony received a constant stream of negative publicity almost since Clear View purchased the magazine in 2016 from the Johnson Publishing Co., headed by Linda Johnson Rice, daughter of the founders. Writers filed suit over nonpayment and personnel have frequently changed.\n\nTracey M. Ferguson, who in February was named editor-in-chief of a revived Jet magazine, then in May was also given the editorship of Ebony, left the company, Ferguson confirmed in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Writers Union said in December it is in court representing 48 freelancers who are owed more than $80,000 by Ebony, and says its next court date is Friday.\n\n8. Investigative Reporting Gets a Boost\n\nIn June, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $150,000 to the new Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting to expand its training programs aimed at supporting journalists of color interested in that crucial specialty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There are a lot of journalists of color who want to be doing [investigative] reporting, but don\u2019t see a path for themselves and have never seen other journalists of color doing this job,\u2019 New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, one of the Ida B. Wells Society\u2019s co-founders, told my colleague Ricardo Bilton earlier this year,\u201d Joseph Lichterman wrote then for Nieman Report.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018When you learn about journalism heroes in college, they are white \u2014 usually white men. It\u2019s important that journalists of color see themselves in these positions and get to be trained by people whose experiences are similar to theirs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUncovering wrongdoing is one of the basic missions of journalistic organizations, one that can best be fulfilled by media with the resources, commitment and experience to give consumers more than opinion pieces and rewriting of others\u2019 work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the Kerner Commission took the news media to task 50 years ago, insisting that \u201cthey must make a reality of integration \u2014 in both their product and personnel,\u201d it also said, \u201cthey must report the travail of our cities with compassion and in depth\u201d [PDF \u2014 Go to Chapter 15].\n\nIn too many cases, the investigative reporting listed below \u2014 just a few examples \u2014 did not involve journalists of color. But in most cases, it did make life better for people of color, or strive to.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution all undertook series examining race relations in their cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, the Marshall Project and the Washington Post \u201crevealed that 19 state juvenile-justice agencies regularly or sometimes require parents to pay for the cost of their children\u2019s incarcerations. Counties in another 28 states also routinely engage in the practice,\u201d Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, wrote to email subscribers. \u201cThe City of Philadelphia, where the story was focused, announced a few hours after our story was published that it would end the practice of charging parents who have kids in detention. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, the Miami Herald reported on \u201cFight Club,\u201d a multimedia investigative series that focused on Florida\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice. \u201cThe Herald investigation revealed a system rife with problems: Staffers organized and bet on fights between kids; workers were hired despite their criminal backgrounds; 12 juvenile detainees died in state care since 2000,\u201d Deirdra Funcheon noted in Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer wrote about prison corruption in North Carolina, prompting a state review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Jodi S.

A Transition in Indian Country\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndian Country Today Media Network, the most comprehensive source of original reporting about Native Americans, \u201cis taking a hiatus to consider alternative business models,\u201d Publisher Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Indian Nation announced on Sept. 4.\n\n\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians announced the next month that is assuming control of the assets of Indian Country Today Media Network, the result of a donation to the organization by the Oneida nation.\n\nNo one can debate the need for strong reporting from Indian Country. \u201cThere is no doubt that Standing Rock changed the way national media outlets think about Indian Country,\u201d Graham Lee Brewer wrote in November for High Country News.\u201dMore than a year after thousands of people gathered to stop the construction of an oil pipeline over Sioux protests, the desire to tell the stories of Indigenous communities is stronger than ever. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t enough publications that know how to tell those stories accurately. Yes, many of these accounts are technically factual, but media have a hard time, even today, properly representing Native communities across the country. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Atlantic magazine\u2019s acclaimed January/February cover story \u201cMy President Was Black\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates mistakenly reported that \u201cAfrican Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\u201d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that dubious distinction belongs to Native Americans. Their omission is \u201cfairly common,\u201d Bryan Pollard, Cherokee, president of the Native American Journalists Association, told Journal-isms.\n\nIn good news for Native people, \u201cThe Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde joined an increasing number of other Native American Tribes nationwide in adopting an Independent Press Ordinance that will codify that the Tribal news publication has the independence to report Grand Ronde news objectively and free from undue political influence by Tribal elected officials,\u201d the Native American Journalists Association announced last January from Grand Ronde, Ore.\n\nThe news is significant because \u201ca free press is the exception and not the rule\u201d in Indian Country, Pollard said then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10.

Johnson, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year.\n\nThe streaming service announced Friday that it had the rights to the documentary about the LGBTQ icon, which tells the story of her life and untimely death.\n\nMarsha P. Johnson was a drag queen, trans woman and vocal activist for rights in the LGBTQ community, playing a pivotal role in the Stonewall riots of 1969. She, along with Sylvia Rivera, worked together to form the world\u2019s first trans-rights organization, STAR (Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries), in 1970.\n\nIn 1992, Johnson\u2019s body was found floating in New York\u2019s Hudson River, and the New York City Police Department initially ruled the death a suicide. However, those who love the powerful icon disagreed with the ruling. In the documentary, France, the director, writer and producer, alongside veteran crime-victim advocate Victoria Cruz, look at what happened to Johnson and the challenges that the trans community still faces today.\n\n\u201cAlmost single-handedly, Marsha P. Johnson and her best friend, Sylvia Rivera, touched off a revolution in the way we talk about gender today,\u201d France said, according to Variety. \u201cTheir names should be household words. But Marsha\u2019s life was cut tragically short and Sylvia died shortly thereafter, the victim of a broken heart. Getting to know their story through the investigation undertaken by Victoria Cruz, a seminal activist in her own right, has been one of the great honors of my career.

I didn\u2019t think anything of it, and then before you knew it, [co-creator and star] Aziz [Ansari] and [co-creator] Alan [Yang] called me like, \u2018So we want to turn your story into a Thanksgiving episode that\u2019s centered on Denise\u2019s own experiences. Can you write this?\u2019\u201d the writer-actress-producer tells The Root.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Waithe was consumed by a hectic schedule\u2014Showtime recently green-lit her drama The Chi\u2014and she wasn\u2019t sure she had the time to give the season 2 script the attention it deserved. But luckily, with Ansari\u2019s tenacity and support, the two knocked it out in a matter of days.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was really nervous, because this was so extremely personal and important. I needed to get it right and do it justice,\u201d she stressed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd justice is exactly what she gave it.\n\n\n\nThroughout this hilarious and unapologetically black episode, we follow Denise through six different Thanksgivings\u2014spanning from the mid-\u201990s to 2017\u2014as she struggles to come to terms with her sexuality and come out to her conservative single mother, Catherine (played by iconic actress Angela Bassett), her aunt Joyce (scene-stealer Kym Whitley) and her Newport-smoking grandmother (Venida Evans).\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s touching, beautiful and real.\n\n\n\nHailed as \u201cbrilliant\u201d by the Washington Post, \u201cThanksgiving\u201d is truly art imitating life, stresses Waithe, down to her grandma\u2019s couch covered in plastic, her oversized basketball jerseys, and her bedroom wall plastered with posters of Jasmine Guy and Jennifer Aniston (Waithe sent the art department pictures of her childhood bedroom for inspiration).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 33-year-old also tells The Root that the scene where she referred to herself as being \u201cLebanese\u201d because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the word \u201clesbian\u201d happened in real life.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing on set and re-enacting all [my past] was such a celebration and was much easier than coming out to my mom,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWhen it was happening in real life, I just wanted it to be over because there is nothing scarier than that.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the attention to detail and authenticity definitely make this episode stand out\u2014so does the its nuanced and layered approach to addressing what it means to come out in the African-American community. Over the years, we\u2019ve been force-fed a tired lie that black folks are more homophobic than anyone else and that admitting to loved ones that you\u2019re LGBTQ can be met only with fire and brimstone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, this episode provides an entirely different narrative.\n\n\n\n\u201cGranted, there are plenty of queer people of color that are kicked out and mistreated by their family, and I don\u2019t want to undermine their experiences. That just wasn\u2019t my experience, and it\u2019s been an honor to be able to tell a story that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Waithe says.\n\n\n\nWaithe emphasizes that her mother\u2019s visceral response wasn\u2019t about God or the Bible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe went to church, but we were never religious. My mother\u2019s issues with me being a lesbian were a mix of denial, not really knowing anything about gay folks, and being this black WASP who was really worried about what the neighbors were going to think,\u201d she explains.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated, and it wasn\u2019t until I was writing this and put myself in my mother\u2019s shoes did I really understand how hard it was for her to process all of this,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t fault someone for not knowing what they don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat empathy for her mother\u2014who, by the way, loves the episode\u2014is apparent with her portrayal of Catherine. While less-aware writers would have crafted her as a villainous, angry black woman, Waithe and her colleagues handle Catherine with care and nuance. In the scene where Denise comes out to Catherine at the diner, Catherine\u2019s reaction shows a mother who loves her child and wants to protect her but is clearly conflicted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want life to be hard for you,\u201d Bassett\u2019s Catherine blurts out, fighting back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough being a black woman in this world; now you want to add something else to that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis conversation happened verbatim, and I see now that my mom wasn\u2019t equipped, and therefore that was her reaction\u2014but the love was always there and was always at the center,\u201d Waithe says.\n\n\n\nWaithe hopes that \u201cThanksgiving\u201d sends the much-needed message that living one\u2019s truth is a process that cannot be rushed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am a huge advocate for being out, but I also understand that this is a journey,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just coming out to my family, but coming out myself and trying to be comfortable with my own gayness. So my advice is to do this at your own pace and your own time.\u201d\n\n\n\nWaithe also hopes that this episode will remind queer people of color how special they are and how important their lives are.\n\n\u201cYou are valid and deserve all the happiness in life,\u201d she says. \u201cSo be whoever you are, look however you want.

Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks. Right?\u201d said the author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream: Forecast and Take Action on Tomorrow\u2019s Trends, Today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could spend an entire day showing you examples of all kinds of places in which machine-learning algorithms don\u2019t recognize darker faces, where if you . . . are a non-Native English speaker, it\u2019s difficult for you to be understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary data sets that was used to train a lot of the voice recognition systems came from Philadelphia from the 1990s; there was a series of I think 700 recoded phone calls. If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined. Based on a Knight Foundation survey of 20,000 respondents:\n\n\u201c45% see a great deal of bias in media coverage today, compared to 25% in 1989\n\n\u201c66% say media doesn\u2019t do a good job separating fact from opinion, compared to 58% who thought the media DID do a good job of that in 1984\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLess than half of Americans can name an objective news source\n\n\u201cAnd yet 84% see the media as key to our democracy\n\nPhoto: George Dalton Tolbert IV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe people are saying, \u2018News and information are important, but we don\u2019t think you are doing it well.\u2019 This is a place where I believe foundations of all sizes can make a difference. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAt one of the breakout sessions, \u201cCommunity-Focused Journalism: Inspiration and How-to for Funders,\u201d Paul Waters of the Democracy Fund and Molly de Agular of the News Integrity Initiative outlined the role foundations can play in shaping community conversations and how funders can influence news operations. No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues. Through collaboration, the journalists had more impact because they discovered new stories and reached new audiences. . . .\u201d\n\nJason Alcorn, MediaShift: Knight Media Forum Focuses on Non-Profit News, Impact and Danger of Algorithms\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranda Bogen, medium.com: Artificial intelligence will force us to confront our values (Sept. 22, 2016)\n\nEditorial, Hartford Courant: The State Of Journalism Today\n\nFuture Today Institute: 2018 Tech Trends For Journalism and Media\n\nLogan Koepke, medium.com: Pre-trial algorithms deserve a fresh look, study suggests (March 30, 2017)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Larson, Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., ProPublica: How Machines Learn to Be Racist (Oct. 19, 2016)\n\nSandi Miller, MIT News: Calculating the cost of tech-fueled discrimination (Dec. 13, 2017)\n\nAnna Orso, billypenn.com: Can Philly\u2019s new technology predict recidivism without being racist?

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head. Unlike other movies that have tackled the epidemic of police officers gunning down African Americans, My Name Is Myeisha takes a totally different approach that is both unique and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nStarring Rhaechyl Walker in the lead role of Myeisha, the film is an artistic revelation that uses hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and dream sequences to recount the final moments of the character\u2019s time on earth before a hail of bullets took her life. The movie is a fictionalized telling of Tyisha\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was unfamiliar with the story of Tyisha Miller,\u201d Walker, who also played Myeisha in the stage play, tells The Root. \u201cWhen Rickerby sent me the script is when I did my research, and it turned my life upside down in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nWalker delivers a zestful performance that outlines Myeisha\u2019s aspirations through dream sequences that happen to coincide with the number of times that she was shot. Instead of being about another slain African American defined by their death, My Name Is Myeisha sets out to tell the story of a young black woman\u2019s aspirations that were tragically cut short before she had the opportunity to see them come to fruition.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique method of storytelling that translates well with the charismatic Walker and her co-star, John Merchant, dominating the screen time. Merchant is especially integral to the film because he plays multiple characters and is the creative force behind each sequence. It\u2019s a tragic hip-hop musical that makes excellent use of its minimal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Walker, it also proved to be therapeutic and helped her rediscover who she was.\n\n\u201cIt was my real introduction to hip-hop,\u201d Walker reveals. \u201cOf course I heard it, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to it. I had this idea in my mind that if you listen to hip-hop, you were a certain type of person. It was really naive, but when I met John, and doing this play, I was able to rediscover what hip-hop really is, and it was a whole new world. I didn\u2019t know there was this place I could belong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly engaging as we get to look at Myeisha\u2019s past, present and what could have been her future. Although it\u2019s fictional, one has to wonder just how much was taken away from the real Tyisha Miller that fateful night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final sequence is especially traumatic as a re-enactment of the moments leading up to the shooting finds Myeisha on the outside looking in while the bullets tear through her body. While discussing this, Walker is nearly brought to tears, despite having been involved with the play for five years before filming the movie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult for me to watch. Even with the first gunshot, and she falls back on the slab, I lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last 10 minutes have a lot of emotion, anger, hurt and happiness. We get to see Myeisha\u2019s life through her eyes, but it\u2019s painful to know that this is still happening today. I hope the people who see this are angry, and I hope they want to do something about these police shootings.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s performance as Myeisha won her the Slamdance Acting Award, while the film took home the Audience Award in the Beyond Feature category. It\u2019s well-deserved because My Name Is Myeisha is both a beautiful and a heartbreaking piece of art rooted in reality. It may not hit movie theaters because of the budgetary constraints, but it has a ton of heart and is worth going out of your way to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing film and the way stories are told,\u201d Walker says. \u201cA hip-hop musical?

{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/to-be-held-by-moonlight-1792774994", "title": "/to-be-held-by-moonlight-", "text": "There was no church scene. There were no tambourines or drums, no preachers loudly proclaiming Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1 and 1 Corinthians 6:9. There were no flamboyant choir directors, teenagers named Arthur or bluesmen named Jimmy; no John or Gabriel Grimes; no Elishas.\n\nYet, this film, Moonlight, directed by Barry Jenkins, could\u2019ve been James Baldwin\u2019s, could\u2019ve been his fictional narrative. And this is because Moonlight, like Baldwin\u2019s work, is all about feeling. And in that way, like Baldwin\u2019s work, it\u2019s also, then, about blackness, religion and the failure to find sanctuary in the most ordinary, everyday, supposedly safe spaces.\n\nI don\u2019t even remember his name. I sorta remember his picture from AOL\u2014a chat room, but which one, I don\u2019t remember, either\u2014but I remember how I felt. I was experimenting, a high school senior with a college sophomore. I remember I didn\u2019t like him much, that who he was, what he said in his profile and his picture didn\u2019t match the person who showed up at my door later. But I wanted to try because I\u2019d felt so alone that I let him in anyway.\n\nI remember thinking that I\u2019d go to hell as soon as he left my parents\u2019 house.\n\n\n\nIt was around 3:50 p.m. and I walked him to my bedroom, up the creaky stairs that made too much noise. I had an hour and maybe 10 minutes. He\u2019d have to get in and get out before my parents got home. His breath stank. His Afro was asymmetrical. We barely did anything at all. I have not seen him since that first and, thus, last day. I let dude in my house because I wanted to be touched and wanted to feel wanted. I let him in my house because I was seeking connection.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking about this, and so many other random encounters, because what Moonlight highlights so well is a kind of loneliness and desire that can lead to all kinds of random encounters. Random encounters that are grounded in touch. Random encounters of intense feeling include Juan (played by Mahershala Ali) reaching out and extending care to a little boy he didn\u2019t know but felt a kinship with, an affinity to. He touched Little (Alex Hibbert), held him gently in water, baptized him to life as possible.\n\n\n\nRandom encounters of intense feeling include Paula (Naomie Harris) and her addiction to crack, how she went from moods of intense love to explicit and harsh rejection of her son. She was touched, too, by Black (Trevante Rhodes) as tears streamed down her face.\n\nEverything in the film, this masterpiece, was a reach for connection.\n\nLittle, then Chiron (Ashton Sanders), then Black, at each stage of Moonlight, felt the touch of Kevin. In such touch was sanctuary and refuge, in such touch was gentleness and quiet. A kind of quiet that was softly vibrational. For Black, in Act 3 of Moonlight, it is revealed that he\u2019d not been touched since Kevin in high school. Was it just the teenage experimentation on the beach, head held in hand, hand gripping sand, he meant? Or did he also mean the violent touch on high school property, the confrontation with Kevin?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe intimacy, discomfort, touch and feeling produced a confrontation with viewers. Would you dismiss it as a gay tale that is sinful because of what the Bible says? Would you discredit it as lacking a plot altogether because a bildungsroman of a black boy is much too much askance for you to consider it real? Or is watching the intimacy between men the occasion for memory and remembrance? The film compels visceral response to it by capturing the visceral quality of Chiron\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about discomfort that emerges in dreams that allow you to consider that other ways of existence might not only be possible, but also pleasurable; that they might bring joy against sorrow, joy unspeakable. Such unspeakable joy becomes imaginable through the discomfort of watching Little, then Chiron, then Black, with Kevin. It\u2019s about intimacy, touch, feeling.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about the search for something so wildly and radically free that he would wait to be touched like that again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film also confronts viewers with a fundamental truth: Homophobia in black is not worse than its performance in other shades. The film does not allow audiences to decry the nature of blackness as the zone in which homophobia is produced. There was Juan. There was Teresa (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). There were the three Kevins. Each provided a space of reprieve and sanctuary; each provided refuge without judgment, without shaming.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s that song that, when you hear it, makes you remember? That smell wafting from the kitchen that reminds you of Mama\u2019s cooking? That color seen that dredges up what happened that day in school so many moons ago?\n\n\n\nKevin hears a song and it forces him to recall Chiron. The sound of the song is memory for him and produces the occasion to reach out, to call, to seek reconnection, to seek touch. Moonlight is a sensual film because it uses various sense experiences\u2014taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing\u2014to be not just the path toward memory, but memory itself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn being about sense experiences, it is about how one feels\u2014and black religiosity, its history and tradition in the so-called new world, is all about feeling.\n\nAt its best, when not colluding with white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, black religiosity allows us to learn how to love our flesh, and love it hard, in a world that does not deem blackness as loving or lovable. The characters typically would be considered sinners according to a lot of religious logics. So we have to think about the way religion is unmarked in Moonlight in ways that create the opportunity to critique the way spaces of so-called sanctuary can become spaces of violence.\n\nThis is the genius of Moonlight. The film wages battle at the level of feeling. Such feeling is often the taboo of dreams or sometimes nightmares, never to be spoken aloud, never to be admitted. You dreamed of her but are not into women. You think of him, how he sometimes hugs you on the court quickly, but in that minuscule moment your heart heats, chest heaves, but he\u2019s just a basketball buddy. It\u2019s the feeling that emerges in night terrors that makes you smile and open your heart to capaciousness, to expansiveness, to possibility.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its best, when not colluding with white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, black religiosity allows us to learn how to love our flesh, and love it hard, in a world that does not deem blackness as loving or lovable.\n\nThe film gathers and depicts the quiet brush of soft intimacy between friends. It is an intimacy learned and produced by gesture, by deep looks, sustained grasped hands. Grabbed sand, chopped onions, slow stares, held head. But then, I guess it\u2019s also about fear, about the fear that such a connection\u2014once established\u2014cannot be sustained. So, for many of us, we just reject the possibility altogether, reject the possibility as desirous, dismiss the possibility as ridiculous. But if we remain with the film, if we open ourselves up to its visceral nature, its touch and rub, its hush and hum, it has the capacity to transform what we think imaginable. And it produces the excitement of imagination through the most ordinary and everyday of encounters, the most simple and gentle ways of existence.\n\nThankfully, winner of the Oscar awards for best picture, writing of an adapted screenplay and best supporting actor, the film yet exceeds easy categorization and framework. Moonlight is not a frivolous film. It is a film of its time, rooted in the 305, in the blackness of the Liberty Square housing project, in the complexity of character and life and love in Miami, in the freedom dreams that emerge from within the struggle with living, with touch, with desire. Moonlight is a touching film, illustrating the healing and generative force of touch between characters. And in such exchange between characters is the capacity for healing and a generative force for viewers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the genius of Moonlight. The film wages battle at the level of feeling.\n\nMoonlight reminds me that black life is about a life touched and held, and that there is joy therein, that the touch I have sought and still seek is one that many of us desire, and that such desire is worthy of its pursuit.\n\nAnd Moonlight reminds me that we should seek out and find delight in black life, and that this joy and delight can be found in the general spaces, the regular places. That we can desire and find touch that frees; touch that makes us remember and makes us forget; touch that holds us close until we lovingly and intentionally embrace those parts of ourselves that we dared not speak into existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n____________________________________________\n\nAshon Crawley is assistant professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Riverside.

The premiere drew in over 3 million views, and the show has a 100 percent fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhile it evokes the surrealism of Twin Peaks, the stoner humor of Dazed and Confused, and the ethos and sound of Southern trap music, the show is uncanny in how it captures the cultural and regional specifics of Atlanta.\n\nFrom the Follies-strip-club reference to the hilarious scene about wet-lemon-pepper wings from J.R. Crickets (I didn\u2019t even know that was possible), Donald Glover\u2019s show is as much about the city as it is about Earn, Paper Boi and the simultaneously profound and unendingly high Darius.\n\nAtlanta is, to my mind, the best show to be set in the city, but that raises an interesting question: What are the other top shows based or shot in that metropolitan area? Here is a ranking of 10 shows you may have missed.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I cannot stand this show (or, really, anything that Tyler Perry makes), but I do recognize the impact his work has on the city\u2014and like many Southern black mothers, mine loves almost everything he creates. This is the most tolerable of his shows, so\u2014here you go, Mom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a lesser version of a show about what I call faux-bougie blackness. The twist here is that the women are either married to doctors or are themselves in the medical profession. Yet it is a living testament to the statement, \u201cYou can pay for school, but you can\u2019t buy class.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to watch hip-hop artist T.I. and former Xscape member Tiny raise their children. Their parenting styles are, at times, confusing but, more often than not, commonsensical. I think they try a bit too hard to play to the camera, but they bring a level of authenticity rarely seen on reality television.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmiley is gifted in his ability to embody familiar character tropes from black church culture. This show ran for three seasons on TV One but failed to find an audience big enough to sustain it. Nevertheless, Smiley\u2019s portrayal of Bernice Jenkins is sidesplitting hilarity.\n\n\n\nAfter this show moved to BET in 2011, it was shot in the ATL. In its own way, this series opened the door for shows like Empire and Ballers because it showed that a comedy-drama populated by people of color could be profitable.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis had so much potential. It premiered in 2013 as BET began its transition into the network we see today. This promising offering purported to be a fictionalized examination of young Wayanses who wanted to be known as artists and not just as the sons of legendarily famous comedic actors and actresses. Unfortunately, the show received poor ratings and was canceled after just 10 episodes.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a fan of neither his respectability politics nor his antiquated views of gender, but Steve Harvey is funny as hell when hosting this game show, which is shot in Atlanta. I have too often had to tell my sons not to repeat things they\u2019ve heard on this show (the sexual innuendo is usually thinly veiled), but they love to play along and try to guess the answers. Lawrence loves the kids, so this show makes the list.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason this show isn't even higher on the list is that it isn\u2019t truly a \u201cblack show\u201d; however, given the diverse cast, I decided to include it anyway. The show was initially shot in and around Atlanta, and the way it captures how quickly a congested city can turn into rural isolation is chilling.\n\n\n\nThis is the gold standard among Bravo series about well-to-do, yet difficult-as-hell housewives. Look, if a show can make NeNe Leaks a star, then it\u2019s doing something unique. The faux-bougie-ness is hilarious, and the show created the template for staged drama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook. I\u2019m an academically trained philosopher. I\u2019ve read Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth three times, and W.E.B. Du Bois\u2019 Souls of Black Folk literally changed my life. I love Jesus (although I cuss a little), and I regularly attend Bible study. I know which fork to use when eating a multicourse dinner, and I know how to properly pair wines with meals instead of just drinking chardonnay or moscato with every dish.\n\nThat being said, I still like ratchet ish. LHHATL is almost transcendental in its messiness (except for the last season, which was disappointing). From Stevie J\u2019s cartoonish face to Mimi Faust\u2019s absurd turn as an unacrobatic porn star, this show is undeniable absurdist fun. Almost everyone in the show is an aspirational singer-rapper who spends endless hours in the studio, but, ironically, two of the few recent songs of note to be made by a member of the cast are the infectious \u201cI Deserve\u201d and \u201cIn That Order,\u201d by Mama Dee. I am not ashamed to say that I love this show, but I am slightly ashamed to admit that I know the lyrics to both of Momma Dee\u2019s songs by heart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are in the middle of the golden age of television, and it has finally made its way into the black community. Like Queen Sugar, Atlanta is intentional in how it evokes a time and place, and this list is a primer on the many ways the ATL has been captured on-screen. Now I\u2019m off to my local wing spot to see if they know how to make wet lemon-pepper wings.\n\nAtlanta airs on FX Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nLawrence Ware is a progressive writer in a conservative state.

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head.

I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\u201d (video)\n\nTime to Recast World of Decision-Making Machines\n\nFirst, the futurist Amy Webb told the audience of journalists, librarians and foundation managers that they could easily be duped by the ever-growing purveyors of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImages of their faces could be affixed to others\u2019 bodies, their voices to impostors. Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks. Right?\u201d said the author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream: Forecast and Take Action on Tomorrow\u2019s Trends, Today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could spend an entire day showing you examples of all kinds of places in which machine-learning algorithms don\u2019t recognize darker faces, where if you . . . are a non-Native English speaker, it\u2019s difficult for you to be understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary data sets that was used to train a lot of the voice recognition systems came from Philadelphia from the 1990s; there was a series of I think 700 recoded phone calls. If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined. Based on a Knight Foundation survey of 20,000 respondents:\n\n\u201c45% see a great deal of bias in media coverage today, compared to 25% in 1989\n\n\u201c66% say media doesn\u2019t do a good job separating fact from opinion, compared to 58% who thought the media DID do a good job of that in 1984\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLess than half of Americans can name an objective news source\n\n\u201cAnd yet 84% see the media as key to our democracy\n\nPhoto: George Dalton Tolbert IV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe people are saying, \u2018News and information are important, but we don\u2019t think you are doing it well.\u2019 This is a place where I believe foundations of all sizes can make a difference. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAt one of the breakout sessions, \u201cCommunity-Focused Journalism: Inspiration and How-to for Funders,\u201d Paul Waters of the Democracy Fund and Molly de Agular of the News Integrity Initiative outlined the role foundations can play in shaping community conversations and how funders can influence news operations. No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues. Through collaboration, the journalists had more impact because they discovered new stories and reached new audiences. . . .\u201d\n\nJason Alcorn, MediaShift: Knight Media Forum Focuses on Non-Profit News, Impact and Danger of Algorithms\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranda Bogen, medium.com: Artificial intelligence will force us to confront our values (Sept. 22, 2016)\n\nEditorial, Hartford Courant: The State Of Journalism Today\n\nFuture Today Institute: 2018 Tech Trends For Journalism and Media\n\nLogan Koepke, medium.com: Pre-trial algorithms deserve a fresh look, study suggests (March 30, 2017)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Larson, Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., ProPublica: How Machines Learn to Be Racist (Oct. 19, 2016)\n\nSandi Miller, MIT News: Calculating the cost of tech-fueled discrimination (Dec. 13, 2017)\n\nAnna Orso, billypenn.com: Can Philly\u2019s new technology predict recidivism without being racist?

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head. Unlike other movies that have tackled the epidemic of police officers gunning down African Americans, My Name Is Myeisha takes a totally different approach that is both unique and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nStarring Rhaechyl Walker in the lead role of Myeisha, the film is an artistic revelation that uses hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and dream sequences to recount the final moments of the character\u2019s time on earth before a hail of bullets took her life. The movie is a fictionalized telling of Tyisha\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was unfamiliar with the story of Tyisha Miller,\u201d Walker, who also played Myeisha in the stage play, tells The Root. \u201cWhen Rickerby sent me the script is when I did my research, and it turned my life upside down in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nWalker delivers a zestful performance that outlines Myeisha\u2019s aspirations through dream sequences that happen to coincide with the number of times that she was shot. Instead of being about another slain African American defined by their death, My Name Is Myeisha sets out to tell the story of a young black woman\u2019s aspirations that were tragically cut short before she had the opportunity to see them come to fruition.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique method of storytelling that translates well with the charismatic Walker and her co-star, John Merchant, dominating the screen time. Merchant is especially integral to the film because he plays multiple characters and is the creative force behind each sequence. It\u2019s a tragic hip-hop musical that makes excellent use of its minimal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Walker, it also proved to be therapeutic and helped her rediscover who she was.\n\n\u201cIt was my real introduction to hip-hop,\u201d Walker reveals. \u201cOf course I heard it, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to it. I had this idea in my mind that if you listen to hip-hop, you were a certain type of person. It was really naive, but when I met John, and doing this play, I was able to rediscover what hip-hop really is, and it was a whole new world. I didn\u2019t know there was this place I could belong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly engaging as we get to look at Myeisha\u2019s past, present and what could have been her future. Although it\u2019s fictional, one has to wonder just how much was taken away from the real Tyisha Miller that fateful night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final sequence is especially traumatic as a re-enactment of the moments leading up to the shooting finds Myeisha on the outside looking in while the bullets tear through her body. While discussing this, Walker is nearly brought to tears, despite having been involved with the play for five years before filming the movie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult for me to watch. Even with the first gunshot, and she falls back on the slab, I lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last 10 minutes have a lot of emotion, anger, hurt and happiness. We get to see Myeisha\u2019s life through her eyes, but it\u2019s painful to know that this is still happening today. I hope the people who see this are angry, and I hope they want to do something about these police shootings.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s performance as Myeisha won her the Slamdance Acting Award, while the film took home the Audience Award in the Beyond Feature category. It\u2019s well-deserved because My Name Is Myeisha is both a beautiful and a heartbreaking piece of art rooted in reality. It may not hit movie theaters because of the budgetary constraints, but it has a ton of heart and is worth going out of your way to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing film and the way stories are told,\u201d Walker says. \u201cA hip-hop musical?

The woman called 911 from a parking lot outside of a Wal-Mart store on Oct. 7 claiming she had been sexually assaulted by the musician, whose given name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., on his tour bus after she met him at a South Seattle club. . . .\u201d\n\nNelly was booked on second-degree rape charges but proclaimed his innocence.\n\n\u201cWe do not live in a society where a 21 year old college student can feel safe enough to pursue criminal charges against a celebrity for an alleged rape,\u201d [PDF] the woman\u2019s attorney, Karen Koehler, wrote in an open letter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf in a moment of panic and fear, she immediately calls 911, she will be interviewed, detained, and then sent to a hospital where a rape kit will be administered. Hours later after she is allowed to return home, she will look at her phone, only to be besieged by text messages of screen shots of internet articles already describing the incident. Before her initial tears have dried her phone will ring and she will belatedly realize that she is talking to a reporter who is trying to befriend her. How did this reporter get my number . . . will echo through her mind.\u201d\n\nThe code of ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists advises, \u201cShow compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles, victims of sex crimes, and sources or subjects who are inexperienced or unable to give consent. Consider cultural differences in approach and treatment.\u201d However, the lawyer\u2019s statement does not accuse the news media of improper conduct.\n\nLater, the woman gave a recorded statement in a meeting with the investigating detective and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The detective promised \u201cthat no one will know that she has met with them until the investigation is closed,\u201d the attorney wrote. But the police commander told the media that the woman met with authorities. \u201cI failed her with that promise,\u201d the detective said, according to the letter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNelly maintains that no sex crime took place. His lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, said in a statement that the accuser\u2019s \u201creckless accusation, once investigated thoroughly, was exposed for what it was \u2014 a fabrication. A fabrication that has caused Nelly and his family to suffer emotionally and financially. [Rosenblum] wants a public apology from the woman, and will advise Nelly to seek legal action against her,\u201d according to complex.com.\n\nIn any case, \u201cCmdr.

In fact, I think they\u2019re untalented hacks who have made a fortune swallowing blackness and puking it back out because vomit spilling out of a white woman\u2019s mouth is more sellable to the masses than undigested blackness.\n\nSo when I heard that Kanye West joined the Kardashian clan for a taping of Celebrity Family Feud, I asked 100 people named Michael Harriot if they would watch the Kardashian-Wests compete against the Kardashian-Jenners on the game show when it airs. \u201cYou\u2019re damn right\u201d was the number one answer.\n\nBut it\u2019s only because I was immediately intrigued when I saw Kim\u2019s tweet (no, I don\u2019t follow her) with Yeezy in the background, his zombie-like stare pleading with us, seemingly wishing for the camera to flash and eject him from The Sunken Place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, like many people, I have no interest in Kim Kardashian. I think she and her entire family are so desperate for attention that they intentionally court controversy by shitting out putrid, late-night Taco Bell Dollar menu turds of black culture.\n\nThe incredibly talented Michaela Coel put it best when she said Kim Kardashian is: \u201csippin on gin & juice cackling away @ ur flailing tweets; she is bored with life, & trying to incite irrational outrage in black women is her entertainment/way of coping.\u201d\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m following Coel\u2019s advice (who I believe is a Russian Bot. There\u2019s no way anyone can be that beautiful, talented and funny. Nah, she\u2019s a computer algorithm) who suggested this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019re thinking: But Michaela advised us not to tweet about Kim Kardashian in a tweet about Kim Kardashian. But Coel\u2019s oxymoronic example exemplifies our hate/hate relationship with the entire Kardashian/West/Jenner phenomenon.\n\nWe can\u2019t help it.\n\nI know most Caucasians have the rhythm and agility of a beheaded giraffe calf, which is exactly why my second-favorite pastime is watching white people dance. (My favorite pastime is hate-watching Donald Trump drink water as he reads a teleprompter.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all groan at the Kardashian family\u2019s desperate Snapchat thirst traps, but we\u2019ve all seen them. They are superstars for the same reason we are always stuck in traffic: The more horrific the car crash, the more people will slow down to see what happened. I call it \u201cThe Omarosa Conundrum.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not the least bit curious to see how many times Steve Harvey\u2019s mustache messes up and refers to the patriarch of the family as \u201cMr. Kaitlyn.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t know Kylie or Kendall if they walked into my living room wearing nothing but name tags that say: \u201cHello, my name is Kylie,\u201d but I\u2019m going to watch the fuck out of them play the \u201cFast Money\u201d round.\n\nI could tell you that it\u2019s part of my job to watch Khloe\u2019s surgically-enhanced brow furrow when she can\u2019t figure out why \u201cbutt implants\u201d isn\u2019t one of the 5 most popular plants, but I\u2019d be lying. I\u2019m really doing a wellness check on Yeezus because I miss the old Kanye. Plus, it\u2019s going to be hilarious when he goes apeshit the first time he earns a strike, grabs the mic from Steve and says: \u201cI\u2019mma let you finish, but Press Your Luck is one of the greatest game shows of all time! Big bucks, no Whammies!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes, I\u2019m going to watch Kanye on Family Feud the same way I\u2019d love to see Donald Trump on Jeopardy.

You may remember that he teased the album with a visual trailer that was akin to a white version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade visuals, with Timberlake doing odd things in the outside with horses, snow, fire, frilly leather jackets, dirty T-shirts and gloves. He seems to be exploring some long-lost connection he\u2019s felt toward grass and trees and shit. It was laughable at best. It\u2019s almost as if he was going for performative Alaskan bush person, but ya know, I\u2019m paying to see what my AncestryDNA results look like, so who am I to judge a person looking to connect with his inner self?\n\nBe that as it may, the album itself is fairly ridiculous as a concept. It\u2019s cringeworthy in parts and feels almost like the first performative whiteness album in history. Like, he really has a song on this album called \u201cFlannel\u201d that is AS ridiculous as the title suggests, where he tries, in his best folk impression, to make you think that he not only wears flannel but that maybe went to Walmart to get it, as opposed to Saks, where he probably buys all of his Canada Goose and Moncler winter coats and Calvin Klein hosiery.\n\n\n\nHear this and hear this good, Justin: Throwing banjos over Neptunes production does not a \u201cwoodsy man of the people, or of the outside\u201d album make. Who the fuck decides they want to make a folksy album and calls up Timbaland, Danja and Pharrell? And I think that Timbo and Pharrell are some of the greatest producers in music history regardless of genre, but their lane isn\u2019t \u201cmaking white people move with guitars.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, Chris Stapleton is on a song, \u201cSay Something,\u201d that is sure to be a single to convince white people who otherwise only know Justin Timberlake from movies to buy this album. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be disappointed when they can\u2019t stop their pickups from rattling as the 808 from each song forces them to turn the bass further down on their car equalizers. It\u2019s going to be hard to go lower than the current negative 10 setting, though.\n\nWhich is the big problem with this album, aside from what I already said: J.T. is attempting to make a pop-folk album, except his entire musical sensibility is rooted in the Michael Jackson and Prince schools of sound. His creative muses are black music songwriters and producers who have managed to craft pop hits on grandiose scales, but errum, even they probably wondered where these magical woods are that Justin was trying to tell them about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Timberlake first dropped the visual trailer, I actually thought he might be able to pull it off in an avant-garde genre-bending fashion, as long as Timbaland was present and handling the entire direction. Back in 2003, Timbaland crafted a criminally slept-on album for Bubba Sparxxx called Deliverance that is effectively the rap version of what I thought Man of the Woods could be. That album was chock-full of country-rap tunes that were entirely crafted around the sound and themes of Bubba, his story and his voice. Its highs are impressive\u2014Timbaland and Bubba clearly had a vision and they worked hard to execute it.\n\nTimberlake, however, literally went to nothing but producers who work in the hip-hop/hip-pop realm for his woodsy sound, and the results end up being confusing. For instance, the first single, \u201cFilthy,\u201d is some oddly dated futuristic pop that I\u2019m pretty sure nobody would listen to in the woods. Where the fuck is Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon when you need him? Kanye can get him on the line, but Timberlake can\u2019t?\n\nTo be clear, the music on this album isn\u2019t all bad or anything; it\u2019s just confusing. There are some very, very dancy numbers because of solid Neptunes production. Also, none of those songs sound like the theme Timberlake attempted to present. Like, \u201cMidnight Summer Jam\u201d is a fun song that sounds great for whatever wedding you attend this year despite Timberlake\u2019s a-little-too-pitchy falsetto. Of course, he also punctuates this song with odd lines like, \u201cY\u2019all can\u2019t do better than this, act like the South ain\u2019t the shit,\u201d which, #BishWhet?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cSauce,\u201d which, I mean, is some kind of rock-bop knockoff guitar-driven ... you know what? There\u2019s not a single song on this album that wouldn\u2019t be improved by Bruno Mars. I don\u2019t know how better to explain the oddity of this album. I mean, there\u2019s a song called \u201cMontana\u201d because woods, I\u2019m guessing, except that song sounds more like, I don\u2019t know, not Montana? The idea of the state of Montana sounds like open roads and no speed limits. Timberlake\u2019s \u201cMontana\u201d sounds like a song you could play at a meet and greet during fashion week. He does mention mountains in the song, though.\n\nThe title song sounds like it had country aspirations but the Neptunes don\u2019t have a country sound bank OR can\u2019t stop themselves from going full Neptunes. The song is supposed to have a down-home feel, but it just feels like any other Neptunes song that they\u2019ve ever made. Again, none of it is bad music, though the songwriting needs work. It\u2019s just interesting considering what he keeps trying to convince us of: that he\u2019s a Southern man of the woods.\n\nThis album would have been better titled something like 808s and Banjos. Or Views From the 901. Or, hell, I-40 or, more simply, Memphis or Beale Street. If he was really about that life, he could have called the album Memphis Grizzly. The Man of the Woods title implies something that Timberlake simply isn\u2019t: a motherfucking man of the woods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat he went into the woods as a kid or watches Ozark doesn\u2019t make him a man of the woods. He\u2019s said in interviews that he was going for a feeling of bringing the outside indoors\u2014hence the woods. And that\u2019s cute, but his outside sounds like some inauthentic attempt at whiteness that he, while white, has never really dabbled in musically.\n\nI\u2019m sure the album will sell well and have a few singles that might cross over to other charts aside from where he feels the most comfortable\u2014pop and R&B\u2014but I feel like this album was what happens when an artist starts to lose touch with what makes him interesting to begin with\u2014giving in to his natural musical tendencies and letting the audiences come to him.\n\nOr maybe I just ain\u2019t been to the woods in a while.", "keywords": ["probably", "neptunes", "man", "album", "justin", "called", "woods", "808s", "sound", "sounds", "timberlakes", "banjos", "know", "timberlake", "song"], "polarity": 0.07646825396825398, "subjectivity": 0.44858415693321335},

Before you object to my use of the word \u201cslave,\u201d let us be clear: I do not mean \u201cslave\u201d in the way you are thinking.\n\nI am not trying to invoke the pain and trauma of our ancestors in a hyperbolic comparison. When I write \u201cslave,\u201d I am not using it in the narrow sense of the mid-Atlantic holocaust perpetrated against African people. I\u2019m using it in the correct sense. I\u2019m using it according to the definition of the word. I\u2019m using it according to every definition of the word.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines a slave as:\n\nA person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them. 1.1 A person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation. 1.2 A person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something. 1.3 A device, or part of one, directly controlled by another.\n\nAccording to ESPN, which is keeping a week-by-week tally of which professional football players protest this season during the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d this past Sunday only 10 NFL players participated in protesting racial inequality by kneeling or refusing to stand during the national anthem\u2014the fewest this season. Other players protested by raising fists during the song, staying in the tunnel or demonstrating before the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday at 6 p.m., ESPN will air another version of Sportscenter, the network\u2019s most popular version of its flagship program, without anchor Jemele Hill. Hill is serving a two-week suspension for tweets that the company said violates its social media policy.\n\nWhen Sportscenter hits the air, one of the lead stories will probably be about the University of Louisville\u2019s decision on whether it will fire head coach Rick Pitino. Pitino has been implicated in a FBI investigation that alleges that he and a number of officials at other NCAA colleges paid third parties hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure recruits to their individual university athletics programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some who will counter that the decrees of these organizations are no different from the rules and contractual obligations of any other employer for any other company. They are correct. But here is the difference between the NFL, ESPN and NCAA and other organizations:\n\nThe NFL\u2019s black players are not being disciplined because of infractions. The NCAA is not cherry-picking which coaches to target for violating NCAA rules. Hill is not being censured for breaking ESPN\u2019s policy. Each of these entities knows that it cannot profit without the absolute control of the livestock whose talent and toiling line the pockets of the overseers. The suspensions, fines and proposed benchings are not a play for order and fairness. They are meant to assert control. They are proclamations of ownership.\n\nA person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlavery has absolutely nothing to do with pay. It is about ownership. It is about control.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said: \u201cThe policy and my actions are going to be if you don\u2019t honor and stand for the flag in a way that a lot of our fans feel that you should, if that\u2019s not the case, then you won\u2019t play.\u201d Jones is within his rights to do so because of a quiet change in NFL policy that allows the league and individual owners to discipline players for not standing for the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly 80 percent of the NFL\u2019s players are black. One hundred percent of the NFL\u2019s majority owners are white. But this issue is not about color; nor does it have anything to do with the flag or the anthem. It is about a group of billionaires knowing that they cannot allow the bodies they ostensibly \u201cown\u201d to coalesce into a united, vocal force. It is about stamping out rebellion and resistance.\n\nIt is about forcing their legal property to obey.\n\nThis is the same with ESPN and Jemele Hill. ESPN claims that Hill violated its social media policy by tweeting her opinions from her personal social media account. ESPN\u2019s policy states:\n\nWriters, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in \u201chard\u201d news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any public-facing forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is debatable whether Hill is considered a \u201creporter,\u201d ESPN\u2019s rules also say:\n\nOutside of \u201chard\u201d news reporting, commentary related to political or social issues, candidates or office holders is appropriate on ESPN platforms consistent with these guidelines.\u201d The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports.\n\nESPN pays Hill, in part, because she is black and outspoken. The network monetized her unapologetic blackness in the same way the NFL capitalizes on its mostly black workforce. According to AdAge, since ESPN moved Hill and co-host Michael Smith to their flagship program, the show\u2019s audience is 12 years younger and has increased its Hispanic and African-American audience by 39 percent, attracting better and higher-paying advertisers. Never forget how the network chose to promote the new, hip SC6 when it named Hill and Smith as anchors:\n\nESPN wants the unapologetic blackness without the unapologetic part. Or the black part. To ensure that, the network twisted its rules and contorted itself into a bullwhip to make sure Hill knows what not to say. How not to act. If she is to be the network\u2019s legal property, it wants to make sure she knows that she should obey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollege athletes are no different. The FBI investigation that claimed Pitino\u2019s inviolability arbitrarily focused on a group of schools where boosters were funneling money between coaches, sports agents and shoe companies to get top recruits to commit to certain colleges. You know who wasn\u2019t making any money?\n\nCollege players.\n\nAlmost every analyst and expert who covers college sports says that these kinds of deals take place at almost every high-profile university athletic program. The NCAA, like the NFL and ESPN, selectively enforces its rules to ensure the steady flow of free labor that enriches the institution without compensating the players\u2014or, as the definition of slavery says, \u201cwithout proper remuneration or appreciation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen an investigation exposed the University of North Carolina\u2019s sham African-American-studies program that gave athletes fake grades for 18 years, absolutely nothing happened. When poor black students complete four years of eligibility without a degree after making millions for their colleges, absolutely nothing happens. College athletes can\u2019t obtain outside employment without permission. They can\u2019t leave the plantation schools if their current college won\u2019t allow it. They are \u201cexcessively dependent\u201d on their universities.\n\nWhen Donald Trump suggested that ESPN should terminate Jemele Hill or that NFL owners should fire \u201cthat son of a bitch\u201d who \u201cdisrespects our flag,\u201d he knew what he was doing. It wasn\u2019t simply a call to white supremacists who wrap themselves in patriotism because it is the \u201clast refuge of the scoundrel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a dog whistle to his base.\n\nIt was a plea to make America great again. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that no matter how rich, successful, talented or accomplished a black person in America may be ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... that black person can still be a slave.", "keywords": ["hill", "system", "person", "social", "jones", "jemele", "espn", "ncaa", "jerry", "rules", "black", "policy", "players", "nfl", "slave"], "polarity": 0.040663910831436605, "subjectivity": 0.43705389684771123},

This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods. Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["isnt", "white", "lives", "fighting", "extreme", "bie", "justice", "narrative", "black", "way", "basic", "cant", "extremism", "human", "felicia", "attack", "killed", "rights"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

In fact, I think they\u2019re untalented hacks who have made a fortune swallowing blackness and puking it back out because vomit spilling out of a white woman\u2019s mouth is more sellable to the masses than undigested blackness.\n\nSo when I heard that Kanye West joined the Kardashian clan for a taping of Celebrity Family Feud, I asked 100 people named Michael Harriot if they would watch the Kardashian-Wests compete against the Kardashian-Jenners on the game show when it airs. \u201cYou\u2019re damn right\u201d was the number one answer.\n\nBut it\u2019s only because I was immediately intrigued when I saw Kim\u2019s tweet (no, I don\u2019t follow her) with Yeezy in the background, his zombie-like stare pleading with us, seemingly wishing for the camera to flash and eject him from The Sunken Place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, like many people, I have no interest in Kim Kardashian. I think she and her entire family are so desperate for attention that they intentionally court controversy by shitting out putrid, late-night Taco Bell Dollar menu turds of black culture.\n\nThe incredibly talented Michaela Coel put it best when she said Kim Kardashian is: \u201csippin on gin & juice cackling away @ ur flailing tweets; she is bored with life, & trying to incite irrational outrage in black women is her entertainment/way of coping.\u201d\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m following Coel\u2019s advice (who I believe is a Russian Bot. There\u2019s no way anyone can be that beautiful, talented and funny. Nah, she\u2019s a computer algorithm) who suggested this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019re thinking: But Michaela advised us not to tweet about Kim Kardashian in a tweet about Kim Kardashian.

They are superstars for the same reason we are always stuck in traffic: The more horrific the car crash, the more people will slow down to see what happened. I call it \u201cThe Omarosa Conundrum.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not the least bit curious to see how many times Steve Harvey\u2019s mustache messes up and refers to the patriarch of the family as \u201cMr. Kaitlyn.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t know Kylie or Kendall if they walked into my living room wearing nothing but name tags that say: \u201cHello, my name is Kylie,\u201d but I\u2019m going to watch the fuck out of them play the \u201cFast Money\u201d round.\n\nI could tell you that it\u2019s part of my job to watch Khloe\u2019s surgically-enhanced brow furrow when she can\u2019t figure out why \u201cbutt implants\u201d isn\u2019t one of the 5 most popular plants, but I\u2019d be lying.

For them, the acceptance of their white plastic counterpart is like bitcoin; they don\u2019t fully understand it, but they know that they value it more than hard cash. They long for it.\n\nSad to say, but Kanye has been fawning for white approval for some time now. He wants desperately to be seen as the modern-day Steve Jobs and Walt Disney. He wants desperately to be accepted by the major fashion houses like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. He longs to be categorized among America\u2019s great whites, so much so that he\u2019s allowed himself to become the fawned-over black addition to the Kardashian circus.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen Kim\u2019s impact on Kanye\u2014the recluse who\u2019s had a nervous breakdown, yet also produced a fat-dad clothing line called \u201cCalabasas\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve not seen Kanye\u2019s impact on Kim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is partly because the Kardashian machine never changes. It runs on likes and retweets and other vapid forms of approval. It is all the stuff that all the psychologists have ever written about the id and the superego, all snapshot into one Instagram post. The machine stays the machine; the only changes happen to those who fall within its purview.\n\nIf you expected the bullish and outspoken Kanye to change the Kardashian template to look like an original forward-thinking woman who stopped pillaging the soul of black women, then you were wrong.\n\n\n\nWhile Kanye, an actual master craftsman masquerading as a genius, adds a legitimacy to Kim\u2019s Frankenstein-esque concoction, he doesn\u2019t seem to add a voice.

I haven\u2019t actively been boycotting; somehow, the NFL just doesn\u2019t seem as enticing to me as it used to, so I\u2019ve made no effort to watch any of it. And I was an NFL stan. It\u2019s my favorite sport to watch. Of all the professional sports leagues, I was most invested in the NFL, and while you could find me in the trap, you could also find me sitting in front of my television religiously every Sunday watching whatever football games were on.\n\nI seem to have lost that loving feeling. Temporarily, at least. And those six downs I\u2019ve seen? I recently flew down to New Orleans, and the Thursday-night game was on in the airport.\n\nSo why am I less invested? Is it because I\u2019m tired of the players taking a stand and invoking politics in football? Of course not. I\u2019m all for that shit. Hell, I both have a Colin Kaepernick jersey AND copped one of the #IMWITHKAP T-shirts from his website. Fight all the powers. I want them to keep doing it. In fact, I want them to ENTIRELY and collectively all kneel JUST to stick it to Roger Goodell, who thinks that now is the time for everybody to stand for the anthem. (I know this won\u2019t happen.)\n\nHear this and hear this good: Fuck the anthem and fuck Roger Goodell. And fuck Jerry Jones and any other owner who thinks that somehow the protests are about the anthem or the flag or the military as opposed to the real issues at stake in the very communities from which many of the athletes employed by the league come. Fuck them all. Fuck ESPN, too, for suspending Jemele Hill FOR DOING HER ACTUAL JOB. If she can\u2019t talk about football and an actual football team, what the fuck else is she supposed to do?\n\nReal talk, I hope that Jemele just quits.

Because always fuck Trump. For many reasons, but in this case, for his own vendetta against NFL players. Like, shit, man, go run a country or something. And good lord, Mike Pence.

If you are truly distracted and incensed by a bunch of black men giving a fuck about something OTHER than football utilizing the only platform you people\u2014yes, you people\u2014respect, then I feel sorry for your mothers. All of them. MOST folks don\u2019t give a shit about the national anthem. Sorry, y\u2019all really don\u2019t. Y\u2019all give more of a fuck about \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d than singing the national anthem.\n\nSure, everybody stands up and either takes a hat off or places their hand over their heart, but that\u2019s probably because you were taught to do that in elementary school and it\u2019s a force of habit. But I find it hard to believe that everybody really gives THIS much of a fuck about the flag or the national anthem. Some do. But this many? Please. This is like those moments where you don\u2019t really care about shit until somebody else doesn\u2019t fuck with it, then you decide you fuck with it hardbody ONLY because they don\u2019t fuck with it, like Kid Rock or kale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people: Seriously, y\u2019all spend so much time acting like this ain\u2019t black folks\u2019 country\u2014how can you be mad when we don\u2019t give a shit about the symbols of it?

Tubman, please. But somehow, again, black men giving a shit about themselves distracts you all from the truly important reason for the gathering\u2014 patriotism football.\n\nShit, so yeah, I entirely lost my point. But that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s been hard for me to get excited for the football season because of everything surrounding it and just how fucking white the country has gone over football. Obviously, football is a white-consumer sport\u2014those white dollars drive the television contracts. But everybody from the owners to the commissioner to the president to ESPN to all of these folks butt-hurt over a respectful, PEACEFUL, nonviolent protest are what\u2019s ruining football (such that it\u2019s ruined), not the players.\n\nThis whole country was founded on white people\u2019s lack of respect for others (rape, pillage and murder of indigenous peoples) and their fucking protest and conquest for religious freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreedom.\n\nHow come when groups that have been historically persecuted by the very fuckers who took their religious freedom into their own hands just say, \u201cHey man, shit still sucks \u2019round here\u2014we\u2019re going to quietly address this,\u201d it\u2019s time to call up Bull Connor\u2019s corpse and get the dogs out again? Over a fucking sideline peaceful protest. White people were throwing Lipton into the waters of Lake Minnetonka Boston Harbor. Tea, fam. Throwing away perfectly good nonperishable items. How come white people forget their own history when it comes time for others to, ya know, get some of that freedom shit?\n\nBut again, this is my point. All of this has nothing to do with football. When I think football now, I think of bullshit and bullshit people and white folks white-folkin\u2019 like they\u2019ve never white-folked before. And it just makes me not feel like paying attention. Also, my team is the Washington Racists. So there\u2019s that ball of wax, too. I honestly have no idea what their record is or their standing in the NFC East.

Yet the Kardashians remain modern-day quicksand for certain black men, and no matter how many times black women warn them that a Kardashian move isn\u2019t a good look; no matter how many men come out of the wringer more worse for wear, there\u2019s another black man standing off to the side like, \u201cHold my warmup jacket.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor these men, who routinely choose an obvious trap, the value-add has to be the white gaze. For them, the acceptance of their white plastic counterpart is like bitcoin; they don\u2019t fully understand it, but they know that they value it more than hard cash. They long for it.\n\nSad to say, but Kanye has been fawning for white approval for some time now. He wants desperately to be seen as the modern-day Steve Jobs and Walt Disney. He wants desperately to be accepted by the major fashion houses like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. He longs to be categorized among America\u2019s great whites, so much so that he\u2019s allowed himself to become the fawned-over black addition to the Kardashian circus.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen Kim\u2019s impact on Kanye\u2014the recluse who\u2019s had a nervous breakdown, yet also produced a fat-dad clothing line called \u201cCalabasas\u201d\u2014we\u2019ve not seen Kanye\u2019s impact on Kim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is partly because the Kardashian machine never changes. It runs on likes and retweets and other vapid forms of approval. It is all the stuff that all the psychologists have ever written about the id and the superego, all snapshot into one Instagram post. The machine stays the machine; the only changes happen to those who fall within its purview.\n\nIf you expected the bullish and outspoken Kanye to change the Kardashian template to look like an original forward-thinking woman who stopped pillaging the soul of black women, then you were wrong.\n\n\n\nWhile Kanye, an actual master craftsman masquerading as a genius, adds a legitimacy to Kim\u2019s Frankenstein-esque concoction, he doesn\u2019t seem to add a voice. I don\u2019t know where he is while his Armenian-and-white wife openly trolls black Twitter. I don\u2019t know what happened to the self-proclaimed mama\u2019s boy raised by a strong black woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier Kanye rapped, \u201cWhen he get on, he\u2019ll leave your ass for a white girl,\u201d and later Kanye did just that, but I didn\u2019t expect him to lose his voice.\n\nWhere\u2019s the gangster Kanye who stormed the stage to silence Taylor Swift with praise for Beyonc\u00e9? Where is the Kanye who said, \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d? Where is the Kanye who once claimed, \u201cKim doesn\u2019t understand what a blessing I am to her\u201d?\n\nThen bless her, Kanye, with the knowledge of appropriation. Bless her with the history of the slave trade. Tell her about the time Venus Williams had a point taken from her during the 1999 Australian Open because the beads from her braids kept falling onto the court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I know that I\u2019m asking a lot.

And it is not lost on me that when given a choice between the two, the Recording Academy loves to reward music that sounds black without rewarding actual black people.\n\nIn fact, since 2008, only one black person has won best album at this award show, and I would argue that Herbie Hancock won because he was paying homage to a beloved, soulful white woman. In the past 10 years, more often than not, black artists were shafted by the academy and forced to watch someone with an inferior, less important album take the award that was rightfully theirs.

This was a powerhouse performance from start to finish. Not a single track is a misstep, and it is all the more powerful knowing how little work we would get from this once-in-a-generation talent.

Gone were his witty lyrics and catchy, soulful beats. Instead, he used the medium of Auto-Tune to express his pain while using the androidlike sound to hide emotions a black man, much less a rapper, was not allowed to feel.

MBDTF, even with its flaws, is a masterpiece and the strongest argument for why Kanye is one of the most important artists in the last 25 years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2012\n\nWon: Mumford & Sons\u2019 Babel\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange\n\n\n\nI like an album full of philosophical folk songs as much as the next guy, but Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange was monumental.

It was not the first \u201csurprise album,\u201d but it was the one that set industry standards about how to release in the streaming era. Why this lost to Beck is beyond me.

His sound was both rustic and virtuosic, while the lyrics were urgent without being inaccessible.

The latter was convened jointly by the American Society of News Editors, Associated Press Media Editors and Associated Press Photo Managers.\n\nMadhulika Sikka, newly named public editor at PBS, concluded her turn on an NPR ethics panel at ONA by saying, \u201cI care less about conversations about ideology, because conversations about race and gender are not being had. . . .

At an ASNE panel Monday titled \u201cHow the world sees US: Press freedom in Trump era,\u201d Mahfuz Anam, editor of the Daily Star in Bangladesh, urged more introspection by the American news media. John Yearwood, chair of the International Press Institute, and Marty Steffens, IPI board member and a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, said press-freedom advocates plan to visit the interior of the United States, where authorities in a city such as St. Louis have been elevated internationally as threats to a free press.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnam also said that U.S. media support for the Iraq war under George W.

The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African-Americans and low-income people.\n\n\u201c \u2018As the clerk who serves the largest population of African-Americans in the state, I was shocked by the numbers and am furious to see that Jim Crow laws are alive and well,\u2019 Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said in a news release. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton lost to Republican Trump in Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes.\n\nReporting on Clinton\u2019s new book about the campaign, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Bill Glauber wrote Sept. 12, \u201cIn discussing what she calls \u2018voter suppression,\u2019 Clinton references studies and discusses the impact the state voter ID law may have had on the result.\n\n\u201c \u2018States with harsh new voting laws, such as Wisconsin, saw turnout dip 1.7 points, compared with a 1.3-point increase in states where the law didn\u2019t change,\u2019 she writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe adds that a Priorities USA study estimated \u2018that the new voter ID law helped reduce turnout by 200,000 votes (in Wisconsin), primarily from low-income and minority areas.

Kim\u2019s latest stunt is no exception, but it deserves to be addressed because this broad has got to be trolling black women, and I\u2019m tired of it.\n\nKim made a Snapchat video to announce to the world that she had gotten her hair done in \u201cBo Derek\u201d braids and that she was quite happy with them.

You know that Bo Derek did not originate that hairstyle. While she may have been the first white woman mainstream America saw wear the style, we all know that she got it from black American and African women throughout the Diaspora who have been wearing their hair like this for generations.\n\nThis is a repeat lesson for you, Kim.

The note read, \u201cTo my niggas in Paris\u201d\u2014a quip and a nod, I suppose, to the Jay-Z-and-Kanye song.\n\nNeedless to say, the backlash was swift and harsh, and by Tuesday morning, Sergeenko posted the most hilarious nonapology of all time, except it only served to add fuel to the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this nonapology, the fact that her daughter is part Armenian, and she grew up in a small town in East Kazakhstan, somehow became pertinent information because of her use of the word.

Well, the NFL got that shit canceled because it didn\u2019t like how the show depicted the NFL, even though it was completely fictional and didn\u2019t even mention the NFL. That\u2019s how much power the NFL has over the sports network.\n\nHill reportedly violated ESPN\u2019s social media regulations when she suggested on Twitter that if people were upset about Jerry Jones\u2019 mandate that all Dallas Cowboys players must stand for the national anthem or be benched, they should boycott the Cowboys\u2019 advertisers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill\u2019s tweet came weeks after she caused quite a stir for tweeting that the president of the United States is, in fact, a white supremacist. Nevertheless, ESPN decided that this second time was enough. But anyone with eyes and decent vision can tell you that Hill is being punished for her first tweet.\n\nHill is a sportscaster who was tweeting on her own free time, and her job decided to suspend her. It\u2019s happened before, and it\u2019s subjective and feels really petty even for ESPN. That should\u2019ve been it, but not when the president of the United States has the sensibilities of a petty-ass bitch.

Also, what is this thing that he always does when he just claims that ratings are tanking?\n\nThe president of the United States is a bratty, spoiled child whom no one can control or correct, and that should be scary for all of us. I think the base requirement of a sitting elected official should be spelling. You can\u2019t even get out of third grade if your spelling game is not at grade level. Parents will have to conference with teachers, school administrators will be brought in to discuss specialized lesson plans, and yet the president of the United States is not at grade level, and no one thinks this is a problem.\n\nI mean, it isn\u2019t like Puerto Rico has drinking water, or raging wildfires aren\u2019t killing people in California\u2014but yes, let\u2019s wade into the waters of a sportscaster\u2019s suspension because why not? It isn\u2019t as if Trump knows what the hell else is going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m convinced that the president tweets petty shit every morning because that\u2019s where he\u2019s safe, like a kid in class who doesn\u2019t get long division, but he\u2019s got games on his phone.\n\nI hate this man.\n\n* It\u2019s been pointed out to me that \u201cmike\u201d is actually how some people spell \u201cmicrophone\u201d because ... wypipo.", "keywords": ["fires", "shit", "hill", "thats", "man", "rico", "president", "raging", "tweeting", "residents", "jemele", "united", "water", "petty", "puerto", "hes", "states", "nfl", "espn"], "polarity": -0.017045454545454548, "subjectivity": 0.5380050505050505},

He\u2019s talking about the word \u201cgenius\u201d and whether it applies to Kanye West, a term the rapper-producer has bandied about\u2014about himself\u2014for years.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s definitely smart, and I think he\u2019s very driven and wants to change the world,\u201d Johan says. \u201cA lot of people not called genius are capable of that.\u201d Then he hedges: \u201cBut if there is such a thing as a genius, then probably.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen The Root spoke to Johan and his partner, Yuga Cohler, conductor and co-creator of Yeethoven, they were about a week out from the show\u2019s performance at the Belasco Theatre in Los Angeles. The two are classically trained musicians who met as teens in Boston (back when Johan went by \u201cStephen Feigenbaum\u201d), and are now collaborating on Yeethoven II, a sequel to last year\u2019s widely heralded debut, a mashup of West and Ludwig von Beethoven, another ambitious creative who also broke music conventions, and who also had asshole tendencies a \u201cprickly personality.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, when Cohler became music director of the Young Musicians Foundation in Los Angeles, he approached Johan, a producer who had worked with artists like Vic Mensa, and pitched him on a classical West project. After many conversations, they chose to pair West with Beethoven, which made the most sense. At least to them.\n\n\u201cPeople more in the classical world would be like, \u2018Kanye West? How dare you even make that comparison? I hate all his late stuff.\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s exactly what people said about Beethoven at the time.\u2019 As Beethoven got crazier with his music, people were like, \u2018What is this guy doing?\u2019\u201d says Johan. \u201cThere\u2019s also tons of stories of what a jerk Beethoven was, and I guess people tolerated it because of the music. So I think it\u2019s kind of funny.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Young Musicians Foundation provided a 50-piece orchestra to stage the 13-song concert (seven works by West, six by Beethoven) in December 2016. Soon after the first showing of Yeethoven, Johan and Cohler were approached by Lincoln Center, which offered to stage the show in the famed home of the New York Philharmonic. Yeethoven II was born, and this time, it adds works from The Life of Pablo, West\u2019s last studio album.\n\nJohan admits that he did not come to know West\u2019s music until 2010\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (Cohler had been down since Late Registration), but both agree that with Yeezus, something shifted in West\u2019s oeuvre. The Life of Pablo is more in the same vein.\n\n\u201c[The songs on Yeezus] don\u2019t work the way most hip-hop or pop songs do, or even some of his old songs. This new stuff has evolved kind of freely,\u201d explains Johan. \u201cSome of these songs go on for, like, nine minutes and have like three different whole parts to them, unrestricted by song formats or pop formats. And I think that reminded us of classical music even more than other hip-hop music, and I think that\u2019s where it started for us.\u201d\n\nYeethoven.org\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d says Cohler. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of the formal elements of his music; the way he organized his music in the last two albums are very reminiscent of and evocative of the way conductors try to organize classical music.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut using live instrumentation to replicate hip-hop is a bit complicated.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce we decided what songs we wanted to use, then it was like, \u2018What instruments are going to sound like this?\u2019 And in some parts it was easy. \u2018Blood on the Leaves\u2019 has trombones in it that are really loud and obvious. Other parts, you have to find the right combination ... so it\u2019s like the viola and the clarinet together doing this particular [...] effect. Basically, the music comes from Kanye, but it\u2019s been expanded and transformed to be its own thing.\u201d\n\nThough there obviously is overlap between classical music fans and fans of West, the concerts themselves are exceptional in that they bring lots of different folks together for a visceral, unique event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think people just want dope experiences; they want to be challenged and experience some cool shit,\u201d says Johan. \u201cFor this concert, I want to say, \u2018Whatever you thought Beethoven was, there\u2019s people who don\u2019t look like him that are around now, and their shit is on the same level, whether you want to call it genius or not.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Jan. 18 Yeethoven II show at Lincoln Center show is sold out, but interested buyers may contact the Young Patrons by email or can call 212-875-5236 for potential last-minute availability.\n\n", "keywords": ["songs", "cohler", "west", "music", "orchestral", "classical", "mashup", "making", "kanye", "ii", "yeethoven", "johan", "think", "whats", "beethoven", "genius"], "polarity": 0.11554691653375865, "subjectivity": 0.47606706159337725},

The question, on a mutual friend\u2019s Facebook post, asked if voters were happy with their decision to elect Donald Trump president. The white woman responded that she was satisfied with the job Trump was doing, and that she supported him because he was \u201cher president.\u201d\n\nBecause this was publicly shared on Facebook, and seeing as how I\u2019m a card-carrying, registered asshole, I boldly asked how she could support someone who openly demonized and marginalized people of color, including her son. Megan (yes, that\u2019s her name, because\u2014isn\u2019t it always?) didn\u2019t have any concrete response, and\u2014according to her\u2014she didn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation as to why she made decisions that would adversely affect her children and children who look like them. She did, however, wonder why she was being called a racist because she voted for Trump. Now, I had not called her that, but, I mean, hey, if the Ugg fits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe finished by accusing me of jealousy. I must be envious\u2014she said\u2014because she lies down next to a black Republican every night and takes black dick, and she was better off than the black women commenting.\n\nShe apparently thought that in all of my black femme desperation, I must be jealous of Great Value versions of black women who place themselves on a pedestal for snagging black men who don\u2019t want to associate with black people. This woman believes that her affinity for black men means that she cannot be racist.\n\nSadly, CyberBecky and her warped ideology are not alone. There are many people who use their interracial relationships, both past and present, to prove that they can\u2019t be racist. There are parents of biracial children who are blind to racism because they believe that bearing half-black children means that they cured racism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNews flash: Sex with a black man doesn\u2019t earn you a get-out-of-racism-free card.\n\nIf so much of some black men\u2019s love for white women is built firmly on their subconscious hatred or disregard for black women, how could that toxic mentality not be perpetuated in their relationships and, therefore, in their homes? How often do we see white women showing support for black penis but not black lives?\n\nTake, for instance, Rachel Bush, the white Instagram model, Trump supporter and fiancee of Buffalo Bills player Jordan Poyer. Bush stated that her fiance would not be taking a knee because Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest creates \u201cmore division\u201d and she believes the protests are \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel Bush has an interracial child, but to the rest of the world, including Donald Trump and police officers, she has a black child.\n\nUntil very recently, biracial or mixed children were considered black, and even today, their proximity to whiteness won\u2019t protect their blackness from police brutality, from being passed over for jobs, from being denied by loan officers or from being discriminated against by teachers, especially like the ones who called their \u201cfriend\u201d a nigger when they were in the eighth grade.\n\nIn middle school, I was called \u201cNi-ig-ger\u201d (Budweiser-frog-style) by two so-called friends. One became a teacher in a poor black school in order to wipe out her student loan debt, and the other spent at least a good half of her sexual history (high school included) consuming dark meat. Even though this happened when we were young, I highly doubt that their racism just vanished into thin air or was just a phase they simply grew out of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiracial or mixed children\u2019s proximity to whiteness is just that\u2014proximity. Whiteness is just that\u2014whiteness. If someone has children with a black person without understanding the important nuances of race in America, he or she is not exhibiting a love-conquers-all, colorblind mentality; he or she is being willfully ignorant of the fact that black people are being treated differently.\n\nWe know that the number of black men who date white women far exceeds the number of black women who date white men. Nor are black women exalted by society the way white women are. In the few interracial relationships that I\u2019ve seen with black women and white men, the black women are usually still remarkably black as fuck, and they still defend all black people (with a few exceptions).\n\nAnd we can\u2019t ignore the inherent sexual stereotypes that have marred black people for centuries. Black men and women have been seen as sexual beasts since we arrived in this country. Black men with their oversized penises, black women with their oversized breasts and asses, and both with their oversized sexual appetite became a sick fetish meant only for white pleasure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen people say they can\u2019t be racist because they have a black child, I laugh, as if the insertion of black penis into white vagina or white penis into black vagina is some magical act that wipes you clean of all your racism. As if there isn\u2019t porn specifically dedicated to the subjugation of black women by white men. As if white demure housewives being beasted by a group of sex-crazed black men aren\u2019t trending on YouPorn. As if slave owners and their sympathizers didn\u2019t have children by black women while simultaneously writing laws that kept slavery legal and/or otherwise contributing to the subjugation of black people (Thomas Jefferson and Strom Thurmond, just to name a few).\n\nThere\u2019s a clip of Kim Kardashian, the model for black-dick-taking excellence, trying to find the perfect stroller to go with her not-yet-born baby\u2019s skin tone. More recently, she has spoken out about forgiving Jeffree Star, a makeup artist who has reportedly made several racist remarks. She has exclusively dated black men. But Kim K. does very little to use the mouth that she has wrapped around black penises to be vocal about black issues.\n\nShe emulates and surrounds herself with black women. She made a fortune from being the bottom-shelf version of us, but has only spoken out once about black issues, you know ... because of the kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite parents, you\u2019re going to have a love for your children that no one else has or can replicate, so it\u2019s obvious that you will love their little bodies despite the fact that they\u2019re black, but just because you fuck black people doesn\u2019t mean you fuck with black people.\n\nP.S.: Comb that baby\u2019s hair!", "keywords": ["woman", "relationships", "racist", "white", "sexual", "called", "women", "children", "absolve", "biracial", "dear", "black", "racism", "interracial", "trump", "men"], "polarity": -0.014207378012933569, "subjectivity": 0.43069547325102836},

Newspaper editorials helped push it there.\n\n\u201cReporting from Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria has been one of the toughest assignments for journalists, as the island is grappling with damaged infrastructure, limited commercial flights and spotty electricity and cell service,\u201d Hadas Gold reported Wednesday for CNNMoney. \u201cAnd yet, nearly every major American English and Spanish-language broadcast, cable network and national newspaper [has] correspondents on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe networks have not necessarily deployed their big name anchors as they did for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the storm and its aftermath [are] not attracting the same wall-to-wall coverage. Nonetheless, intrepid journalists are still getting to the story, and sometimes become the first outsiders to reach remote areas on the island.\n\n\u201cSome reporters were in place before the hurricane hit last Wednesday. But many more have just started arriving in the past few days on the few commercial flights available, or tagging along with rescue missions and military transports. Reporters on the island are resorting to filing stories using satellite phones by dictation, relying on the few places with generators, whatever cell service and WiFi they can find (especially in the capital San Juan) and other broadcasting services like LiveU and FlyAway to get their stories online and on air.\n\n\u201c \u2018Most of the team is staying at hotels without electricity and water. They have relied on the local station for water and power. Needless to say, gas, food and cash are hard to get,\u2019 said Telemundo spokesperson Camilo Pino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSpanish language networks have gone all in on the coverage to cater to their Spanish-speaking viewers, many of whom may have family ties with those on the island. Telemundo sent three correspondents and one host, in addition to dozens of producers, cameramen and fixers who are working closely with the local affiliate, Pino said.\n\n\u201cUnivision has 35 people on the ground and a remote FlyAway studio for transmission, a network spokesperson said. . . .\u201d\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: Donald Trump\u2019s too busy tweeting to express concern for Puerto Rico\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Chicago Sun-Times: Ignore the dumber Trump tweets and rescue Puerto Rico\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Puerto Rico needs more U.S. assistance \u2014 now\n\nEditorial, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Citizens in crisis: The devastation in Puerto Rico cries for response\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Hurricane-ravaged U.S. Caribbean territories require urgent help\n\nTom Embury-Dennis, the Independent, London: Donald Trump accused of \u2018owing\u2019 Puerto Rico $33m after golf club bankruptcy\n\nSeth Fiegerman, CNNMoney: Trump\u2019s FCC criticized for hurricane response\n\nJuan Gonz\u00e1lez and Amy Goodman with Nelson Denis, Democracy Now!: Profits vs. Puerto Rican Lives: Trump Admin Blocks Aid from Reaching Devastated Island\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDana Milbank, Washington Post: The sad suspicion about Trump\u2019s shameful treatment of Puerto Rico\n\nMary Mitchell, Chicago Sun-Times: Hurricane Maria is Trump\u2019s Hurricane Katrina\n\nAndr\u00e9s Oppenheimer, Miami Herald: Trump\u2019s response to Puerto Rico\u2019s Hurricane Maria: slow, unenthusiastic and mean\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Davidson Sorkin, New Yorker: The Distance Between Donald Trump and Puerto Rico\n\nHelen Ubi\u00f1as, Philadelphia Daily News: New Jersey mom frantic to reach loved ones in Puerto Rico\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLauren Williams Named Editor-in-Chief at Vox.com\n\nLauren Williams, a veteran of TheRoot.com, Mother Jones and AOL Black Voices, has been named editor-in-chief of vox.com, where she was executive editor, co-founder Ezra Klein, the previous editor-in-chief, announced on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe promotion stands in contrast with the start-up\u2019s image when it launched in 2014, when it was a lightning rod for complaints that Internet startups were devoid of racial diversity.\u201d Effective immediately, Lauren Williams will be Vox\u2019s new editor-in-chief.

I didn\u2019t cry because Skipper was mean or rude to me. I cried because I felt I had let him and my colleagues down.\n\n\u201cSince my tweets criticizing President Donald Trump exploded into a national story, the most difficult part for me has been watching ESPN become a punching bag and seeing a dumb narrative kept alive about the company\u2019s political leanings. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill also wrote, \u201cStill, Twitter wasn\u2019t the place to vent my frustrations because, fair or not, people can\u2019t or won\u2019t separate who I am on Twitter from the person who co-hosts the 6 p.m. SportsCenter.

Jones wrote Wednesday for USA Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than 200 players took a knee or locked arms during the national anthem before games on Sunday and Monday, a united front in response to comments from President Trump that attacked individual players and the game at large. . . .\u201d\n\nJones also wrote, \u201cWhen former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the first player to protest during the anthem in August 2016, he did so with the intent of using his platform to raise awareness about police brutality and other social injustices. Other players, such as 49ers teammate Eric Reid, Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall and Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills, joined him in either kneeling or raising a fist during the anthem.\n\n\u201cNow some of those players are concerned that Trump\u2019s comments, including those made on Wednesday when he said the NFL business would \u2018go to hell\u2019 if the league didn\u2019t change its rules regarding protests during the anthem, have obscured the meaning of the protests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018We can\u2019t get lost in what Trump\u2019s said,\u2019 Marshall told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. \u2018We have to try to change the narrative back to what the original message was about.\u2019\n\n\u201cOthers agree. . . .\u201d\n\nBecket Adams, Washington Examiner: Journalism magazine says it\u2019s time to label Trump\u2019s words \u2018racist.\u2019 Good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlejandro Danois, Shadow League: A White Player\u2019s NFL Guide To Taking A Knee During The National Anthem\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump\u2019s personal foul against the NFL and America\n\nEditorial, Dallas Morning News: Trump\u2019s NFL comments served only to coddle the ugliest elements of his base\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: In America, we all get to say what we think\n\nRen\u00e9e Graham, Boston Globe: Why aren\u2019t we talking about racism?\n\nIndira A.R.

These disparities are large, pervasive and remain even when considering a host of factors, including income, assets, and the court districts where debtors lived.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we found that for people residing in majority black zip codes who file for bankruptcy, the odds of having their cases dismissed (and failing to attain lasting relief) were more than twice as high as those of debtors living in mostly white zip codes.\n\n\u201cThe main driver of this disparity is chapter choice. Black people struggling with debts are choosing to file under Chapter 13, as opposed to Chapter 7, at much higher rates. Unlike Chapter 7, which in almost all cases provides permanent debt relief within a matter of months, Chapter 13 is a particularly risky choice for these debtors, because Chapter 13 usually requires five years of payments before any debt is wiped out, and black Americans are much less likely to have the resources to run this gauntlet. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJared Kushner\u2019s Md.

This year, the animated bag of Botox and plastic-surgeon silicone known as Kim Kardashian decided that she would have multiple costumes, all based on her favorite musicians.\n\nSeems fine, right? Everyone thought she looked cute when she came out dressed as Cher, although, to be fair, 94 percent of Black Twitter didn\u2019t know Cher actually made music.

When 21-year-old white girls wear feather headdresses to a concert, that is appropriating Native American culture. When white boys wear blackface to their frat party, it is appropriating black culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not those.\n\nKim is, however, guilty of the lesser charge known as a lane violation.

At his peak, Luda had so much charisma that he had to be placed at the end of a track because no one wanted to follow him. \u201cLudacrismas\u201d showcases what he does best. It has clever lyrics accompanied by a driving, DJ Screw-inspired beat. This is just a fun song. It makes me miss the days of Word of Mouf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cSanta Goes to the Ghetto,\u201d by Snoop Dogg\n\nPlaying off of James Brown\u2019s classic soul song \u201cSanta Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto,\u201d this track from Christmas on Death Row is produced by Snoop Dogg and has a subtly sweet and playful vibe all while highlighting the precarious menace that can come along with life in South Central Los Angeles. This is a Christmas song with a G-funk twist that features Nate Dogg on the track. You can never go wrong with him singing the hook.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cA Christmas Fucking Miracle,\u201d by Run the Jewels\n\nThis is the sonic equivalent of that conspiracy theory uncle who reminds you that Christmas is a white man\u2019s holiday. What your uncle cannot do, however, is tell you those things with the sonic virtuosity of El-P and the lyrical ferocity of Killer Mike. This is a conscious Christmas song meant to be played while holding a shotgun on Christmas Eve daring a white man to sneak into your house.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cChristmas Rappin\u2019,\u201d by Kurtis Blow\n\nThis is the first hip-hop Christmas song, and it sounds like it. The cadence of the delivery is quintessentially \u201970s, while the production by Larry Smith, Robert Ford Jr. and J.B. Moore is stripped down if not elegant. Later, Next would sample this song for their monster hit \u201cToo Close,\u201d which provided a bit of cognitive dissonance for me because each time I heard that song I thought of Christmas. Took me a while to properly atone for that sin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cSt. Brick Intro,\u201d by Gucci Mane\n\nA trap Christmas song by the Right Rev. Gucci wherein he sings, \u201cTrapping through the snow \u2026\u201d What more needs to be said?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cWhat You Want for Christmas,\u201d by the Quad City DJ\u2019s\n\nThis is for when you want to get crunk on Christmas. Besides, establishments catering to the needs of gentlemen need Christmas songs, too.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cSleigh Ride,\u201d by TLC\n\nI love this song. It\u2019s funky, sexy and fun\u2014the three adjectives I\u2019d use to describe the brilliance that was this group at their best. Hearing Left Eye on the track is enough to bring a tear to the eye because her life ended before she could be fully appreciated for her artistic gifts. This is the perfect song for a gathering of friends on Christmas Eve.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cChristmas in Harlem,\u201d by Kanye West\n\nThis is an underappreciated track that deserves to be an annual classic. Kanye samples Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Like the Real Thing\u201d and \u201cMercy Mercy Me (the Ecology)\u201d while featuring (depending on the version) Musiq, Teyana Taylor, Cyhi the Prynce, Cam\u2019ron, Jim Jones and Pusha T to create a song that is rare for Ye: one that is joyful, sweet, playful and warm. This is \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d of hip-hop Christmas songs\u2014a classic that highlights the beauty of the holiday. When I\u2019m ready to get into the Christmas spirit, this and a Basil Hayden holiday spice cocktail is my go-to.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cPlayer\u2019s Ball,\u201d by Outkast\n\nThis is the song that put \u2019Kast on the map. It was released in November of 1993 as part of the upcoming album A LaFace Family Christmas, and aside from a few references to Santa, Big Boi and Andre 3 Stacks essentially say nothing about the holiday\u2014 yet it captures the spirit of the season perfectly. \u201cThe song reminds me of holidays in the South spent with your people to kick it and be merry,\u201d says Regina Bradley, an assistant professor of English and African Diaspora studies at Kennesaw State University who teaches a college course on the aesthetics of Outkast.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLike the music catalog that would follow, \u2018Player\u2019s Ball\u2019 merges the sacred and the secular. It celebrates the messiness that is the \u2018ho-ho holidays\u2019 in the contemporary black South,\u201d she continues.\n\n\n\nI struggled to decide if this should be No. 1. Because I am an Outkast devotee, my heart told me yes, but my head, because this song barely mentions the holiday, told me no. As a result, No. 1 is ...\n\n\n\n1. \u201cChristmas in Hollis,\u201d by Run-DMC\n\nThis is the unofficial official hip-hop Christmas song. It samples Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cBack Door Santa\u201d (the unofficial official up-tempo brown-liquor Christmas song) and discusses in an almost magical-realism way the experience of celebrating Dec. 25 in Hollis, Queens, N.Y. To quote Rebecca Carroll, editor of special projects at WNYC and host of the forthcoming podcast Black Folks, \u201cIt\u2019s a classic funky disruption with all due respect type of jam.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere you have it: the top 10 Christmas hip-hop songs of all time. Each one is suitable in be in rotation year-round. Because after all, there is never a bad time to listen to \u201cPlayer\u2019s Ball.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["songs", "christmas", "classic", "holiday", "best", "need", "music", "track", "hiphop", "ranked", "song", "santa"], "polarity": 0.18902894491129785, "subjectivity": 0.40999066293183967},

Day after day, I write posts that include news about the Trump administration, and in each of those posts, I ridicule the president and his administration while simultaneously calling out the systemic racism that he and his cronies perpetuate and uplift.\n\nUnless I specifically libel or otherwise defame the president and his administration, I don\u2019t have to worry about being forced by my company to apologize for speaking the truth. I wanted that for Jemele Hill.\n\nIn the time since her tweet about Trump got the president and his amen choir all up in their feelings, Hill has continued to tweet. She\u2019s continued to do her thing and speak her mind, but there seems to be an air of caution around her now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the social burden of being a black woman with a large platform and an engaged social media presence: People are constantly trying to shut you down when your opinions and your thoughts are too big for them to handle. When that happens, they will personally attack you, your family, the people you love, and they will almost always go after your job. That is what they did to her.\n\nThe sad part is, we are talking about her First Amendment rights, and for us as members of the media and the press, our jobs rely on that same First Amendment just to exist. Yet, even with that being true, Hill has been told over and over again that she needs to apologize.\n\nIn a recent commentary written for The Undefeated, Hill discusses the experience, the aftermath and the daily narrative that is being pushed about her and her employer in the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that she has watched ESPN \u201cbecome a punching bag\u201d as a false narrative about the company\u2019s political leanings gets pushed.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re keeping it all the way real, that narrative is often pushed by the folks in the media who benefit most from that notion and all the attention that criticism of ESPN brings,\u201d Hill writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t about that,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s simply indicative of just how complex things get for people in OUR position\u2014especially if you\u2019re a woman and a person of color.\u201d\n\nNeither the president nor ESPN seemed to have any problem when Sage Steele said that she experiences the most racism from black people. Steele was allowed to have her opinion and speak her truth\u2014whether we agreed with that truth or not\u2014and no one in the executive branch of our government demanded she lose her job. In fact, it would be fair to say that they probably didn\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut whenever you get online and call out white supremacy or white privilege, especially if you are black, and most especially if you are a black woman, you can expect the attacks to be swift and frequent.\n\nCompound that with having a large social media following and getting the kind of engagement numbers from your tweets that corporate brands only dream of, and you have a recipe for trolls, abuse and threats to your livelihood.\n\nAlthough Hill is an employee of ESPN and anchors one of its more popular shows, her Twitter account is her own personal space. At some point every day, she gets off work and is on her personal time. While she may at times talk about things related to her job on her personal Twitter account, it is her personal space that she manages. It does not belong to ESPN, and the network does not moderate it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so she asks, \u201cYes, my job is to deliver sports commentary and news. But when do my duties to the job end and my rights as a person begin?\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a conundrum that many of us in creative and media fields battle daily.\n\nThe level of accessibility that social media affords the general public often leads people to assume a familiarity that is not necessarily there. And because we often deliver information through our personal channels, it gives people the false impression that they are owed our time, our attention, our labor and our words.\n\nThey begin to think they own some part of us. They begin to believe that they can control what we say and what we think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, all of this has led Jemele Hill to believe that she can no longer freely express herself on Twitter.\n\n\u201cStill, Twitter wasn\u2019t the place to vent my frustrations because, fair or not, people can\u2019t or won\u2019t separate who I am on Twitter from the person who co-hosts the 6 p.m. SportsCenter. Twitter also isn\u2019t a great place to have nuanced, complicated discussions, especially when it involves race,\u201d she writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes me sad that she\u2019s reached that point.\n\nLast week, the CEO of my company followed me on Twitter. I immediately felt sorry for him, because while I do use Twitter to discuss social issues and the articles I write for The Root, there is also a healthy dose of talk about sex, ratchetness, music, cusswords, incessant flirting with bearded men and everything in between.\n\nThose things sometimes make me a target for trolls and people who just generally want to attack a self-assured black woman and put her in her place. I cannot imagine how it would feel to worry that those same things could be a threat to my job as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI stand with Jemele Hill. I don\u2019t think she should have to apologize at all for speaking her truth. There are old tweets floating around that show that prior to becoming president, Trump made some highly questionable comments about then-President Barack Obama. The level of hypocrisy here is astounding.\n\nI only hope that she will continue to speak her truth and call out the lies when she sees them. That is our job as journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, living with the social burden of being a black woman in media tells me that the silencing will only continue.", "keywords": ["woman", "hill", "social", "president", "jemele", "espn", "personal", "black", "twitter", "burden", "job", "media"], "polarity": 0.07739940937615354, "subjectivity": 0.4982927279438908},

Many consider that album to be Kanye\u2019s magnum opus (not me \u2026 that honor belongs to Graduation) and the last vestige of the \u201cOld Kanye\u201d before he completely succumbed to whatever peyote he was smoking to create a clothing line for which he asks hundreds of dollars of people to dress like the nigga I periodically give change to on the off-ramp of Diversey and California avenues.\n\nKanye gave us what was probably the best promotional lead-up to an album in hip-hop history: the GOOD Fridays series. Almost every Friday from late August until MBDTF\u2019s Nov. 22 release, Yeezy dropped 14 free tracks\u2014each loaded with a stellar mix of guest artists and producers\u2014on his website. Four of the tracks ended up on the final version of MBDTF in some remixed fashion; the 15th track, \u201cChristmas in Harlem,\u201d came out Dec. 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen taken in concert with MBDTF, Kanye\u2019s GOOD Fridays output arguably marked the apex of his skills as an artist before his music became more experimental and divisive. It was also, presumably, the last time we\u2019d see him working with artists he looked up to at the dawn of his career (Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Common, etc.).\n\nEven the cover art of each track is dope: gigantic bold red Impact typeface on top of either a blacked-out cover or a filtered photograph. If taken as a full-length album, GOOD Fridays is not quite as good as MBDTF, but it\u2019s definitely stronger than Yeezus or The Life of Pablo (Editor\u2019s note: This is categorically false. Continue, though. \u2014D.Y.) or most hip-hop albums from anyone this decade.\n\nIn honor of the seventh anniversary of GOOD Fridays, I rank them all in reverse order (not counting the three tracks he dropped in advance of TLOP in 2016). Yeezy fanatics: Stay out of my direct messages, yes?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. \u201cChain Heavy\u201d\n\nThis track was so unmemorable that I had to go back and listen to it just to write about it. One of the only GOOD Fridays total misfires, not even Q-Tip on the boards or a Talib Kweli verse can help this abomination.\n\n14. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Down\u201d\n\nDespite an always reliable Lupe Fiasco verse, this downtempo song is generally uninteresting. I\u2019m sure everyone involved in the creation of this track was on Xannies at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n13. \u201cLord Lord Lord\u201d\n\nBrian Bennett\u2019s \u201cSolstice\u201d is an entirely overused sample in hip-hop, which automatically undercuts the impact of this track. Uncle Charlie Wilson is always welcome, but \u201cLord Lord Lord\u201d won\u2019t go down as a shining moment for Ye, Mos Def or Raekwon.\n\n12. \u201cLooking for Trouble\u201d\n\nNothing\u2019s actually wrong with \u201cLooking for Trouble\u201d outside of, maybe, the presence of Big Sean\u2014it actually sounds like it came from the cutting room floor of The College Dropout era. But at No. 12, it\u2019s the song that I like least of all the GOOD Fridays songs that I like.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. \u201cTake One for the Team\u201d\n\nNoteworthy for having what might be the funniest, shit-talkingest Kanye verse ever, which is saying a whole hell of a lot. The beatboxing bass line is also pretty dope. I\u2019d love to get my hands on a remastered version.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cGood Friday\u201d\n\nFeel-GOOD hip-hop for your soul. Pusha T bodies Common while Big Sean brings up the rear, as Big Sean is wont to do.\n\n\n\n9. \u201cRunaway Love (Remix)\u201d\n\nA track that features a Raekwon verse and a pre-voice-break Justin Bieber singing the hook over a sample of \u201cWu-Tang Clan Ain\u2019t Nuthing ta Fuck Wit\u201d had no reason to work, then or ever. That it does is all the proof anyone needs of Kanye\u2019s genius musical ear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cDon\u2019t Stop!\u201d\n\nAmong the biggest disappointments of early-21st-century hip-hop (Jay Electronica with no goddamn album is the biggest, so we\u2019re clear) is that Child Rebel Soldier only released two official songs: \u201cUs Placers\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Stop!\u201d At the beginning of the decade, Kanye, Lupe and Pharrell Williams were all razor-sharp and a perfect fit for a hip-hop supergroup. An album from them could\u2019ve been an easy classic. Alas \u2026\n\n\n\n7. \u201cMonster\u201d\n\nI am so averse to Nicki Minaj\u2019s star-making verse on \u201cMonster\u201d that I always turn the song off before it comes on. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great song\u2014from the beat to the hook to everyone else\u2019s verse. Virtually no one agrees with me on this, and that\u2019s quite OK. The line to fight me starts in the back, around the corner. Please don\u2019t block sidewalk traffic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: You\u2019re right. No one agrees with you here. \u2014D.Y.\n\nSeconded. I almost took out the word \u201cvirtually\u201d for accuracy\u2019s sake. \u2014N.D.\n\n6. \u201cChristmas in Harlem\u201d\n\nThe only GOOD Fridays track to drop after MBDTF, \u201cChristmas in Harlem\u201d is probably the best Christmas rap record next to Run-DMC\u2019s \u201cChristmas in Hollis.\u201d A reminder of simpler times between Cam\u2019ron and Jim Jones, this will be on repeat on my iPhone in about a month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cDevil in a New Dress\u201d\n\nKanye didn\u2019t produce this beautiful-ass beat, which samples Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u201cWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow,\u201d but it sounds like his handiwork. The MBDTF version with Rozay has essentially rendered the GOOD Fridays version obsolete; I didn\u2019t fully appreciate it until years later when I started appreciating Rozay himself, but I always appreciated that added guitar solo.\n\n4. \u201cPower (Remix)\u201d\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the remix of \u201cPower\u201d with Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz is the definitive version, mainly because it improves upon the MBDTF version in some crucial ways\u2014namely an added Jay-Z verse and a beat switch during which Kanye snaps over, well, a sample of Snap\u2019s \u201cI Got the Power.\u201d Seven years later, it still gets me hype in the gym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cChristian Dior Denim Flow\u201d\n\nI generally have John Legend issues, but even I couldn\u2019t stop humming the hook of this joint. I, too, don\u2019t know why they keep calling.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cSo Appalled\u201d\n\nProbably my favorite cut on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Everyone brought something to the track, including RZA\u2019s confusing marble-mouthed hook. \u201cSo Appalled\u201d might be most notable for introducing the world to CyHi the Prynce, who\u2019s a solid emcee despite having seemingly Saigon levels of drama in getting that debut album released.\n\n\n\n1. \u201cThe Joy\u201d\n\nOne of my top 10 favorite Kanye songs of all time. Pete Rock did what only producers of his caliber can do: take a completely worn-out sample like \u201cThe Makings of You\u201d and turn it into some minimalist gold that Kanye and Jay both glide over effortlessly. That this was a bonus track on Watch the Throne made it the best track on that album.", "keywords": ["album", "verse", "mbdtf", "version", "tracks", "track", "kanye", "fridays", "wests", "good", "hiphop", "lord", "ranked"], "polarity": 0.16315377494622774, "subjectivity": 0.5210559094993057},

I didn\u2019t love the title, either. The substance of the piece itself was perfectly fine\u2014to argue and debate that would be stupid (more on this later). It\u2019s no different from conversations many of us have in any number of spaces we congregate when sober, perhaps not wrapped up in as neat a bow as Damon presented, but to pretend the substance of the piece was insincere or inaccurate is fucking stupid.\n\nBut that title. Man, it ... stung. Look, any time you compare black folks, especially men, to white people in terms of privilege, it\u2019s going to set off a million nuance and complexity alarms. Black men get to be white people? OK.\n\n\n\nBut then I think back to my ABSOLUTE favorite couplet in ALL of hip-hop history, and possibly the most important in terms of knowing your audience:\n\n\u201cAnd even after all my logic and my theory/I add a motherfucker so you ignant niggas hear me ... \u201d \u2014Lauryn Hill, \u201cZealots,\u201d The Score (1996)\n\nDamon called you motherfuckers a motherfucker at the front instead of AFTER the logic and the theory, but the principle holds. Many people stopped at the title\u2014probably more than many. Considering some of the stupid-ass discussions that occurred, I\u2019d wager that most people didn\u2019t read past the title (more on THAT later, too) and never even read to see why Damon led with it. But if it started a whole lot of conversation, does the end justify the means? Only time will tell, I guess. Sometimes you\u2019re right, even when you\u2019re wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cDo you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?\u201d \u2014Jay-Z, \u201cRenegade,\u201d The Blueprint (2001)\n\nLook, disagreements are OK. In fact, healthy discourse is encouraged. But to determine that, because you disagree with the premise presented in a title, everything else is moot is intellectually dishonest. Also, more importantly, I\u2019ve had more than a few conversations with men I know who, mostly on behalf of others, said that quite a few men were having trouble grasping the point of said article.\n\nAnd I\u2019m just going to go ahead and throw lighter fluid on that fire: If (most) MEN are the ONLY people taking issue with the piece, then perhaps there\u2019s SOMETHING TO IT. It\u2019s kind of like how white people really hate being called racist even after doing racist shit. They take issue. There\u2019s some man-in-the-mirrorness that needs to occur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo pretend that black women\u2019s lives are a crystal stair compared to ours is some absolutely stupid shit. The fucking civil rights movement as a whole is full of stories of marginalized women and rampant sexism. I guess men gon\u2019 men, huh? Which is the fucking point of the piece, is it not? Black men want white people to see how much harm they\u2019re doing to us. Yet if black women want black men to see how that same marginalization rolls downhill, even if it\u2019s not racial, it\u2019s a problem? Which brings us to the next point.\n\n3. Some of you men REALLY hate black women. Good gotdamn. Like, I think I\u2019ve been more lucky than I realize to be around such great women and other black men who also not only love black women but LIKE them. But I\u2019ve read some articles\u2014and no, I won\u2019t link to any of that drivel\u2014that actually made me more appreciative of my upbringing, thankful for my boys, and fearful for our daughters who will have to deal with offspring of these terrible niggas one day in life because undoubtedly, these ignorant fucks will all have offspring.\n\n4. Dear academics who don\u2019t read articles that you decide to do videos about or generally don\u2019t seem to know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about: *CENSORED CENSORED CENSORED CENSORED*\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Piggybacking on how much some black men hate black women, if being supportive of pieces that uplift and ACKNOWLEDGE black women makes one a simp, then I\u2019m a simp, too. I\u2019ll be that. You bitch-ass niggas want to be acknowledged for who you are and yet don\u2019t care to do that for the very woman who birthed you. So I\u2019ll be that\u2014along with Damon and others who are willing to do our part to uplift black women, see them and acknowledge them publicly and in the privacy of our own homes. We all need to do better at it. Period.\n\nSeriously, how the fuck is the black community going to thrive without black women feeling like we see them as much as they see us? They\u2019ve been there for us in every capacity possible, marching next to us, leading the damn charges, etc. How is saying that we need to SEE them, HEAR them and SUPPORT them even REMOTELY controversial? Niggas are ready to boycott both the NFL in the name of racial inequality and VSB in the name of sexism. Let that shit marinate.\n\n6. Jemele Hill retweets an article addressing what is pertinent to her safety and security as a woman, and the very men who supported her on racial grounds get pissed. Talk about proving a fucking point. Too bad so many are too stupid to realize that acting in such a fashion both validated Damon\u2019s points and vindicated him titling it the way he did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. There was one very important silver lining to the entire affair. See, what happens often in online discourse is that folks say things like, \u201cWhy are you focused on THIS when THAT is so much more important?\u201d For some reason, people think that it\u2019s difficult for people to do more than one thing at the same time. Well, fortunately, Damon inadvertently proved that black men can definitely walk and chew gum at the same time: Many of you niggas manage to be both ain\u2019t shit AND oppressive toward women AT THE SAME DAMN TIME. Well, that \u201cwalk and chew gum\u201d argument is now settled.\n\n8. Amazingly, in nearly EVERY convo I had or in the videos I watched or in the analysis I listened to was this idea that yes, black men do need to do better. But it got glossed over in every single fucking conversation, as if that isn\u2019t the ENTIRE point of Damon\u2019s piece. Like, that\u2019s the WHOLE point. He could have framed it differently, but he didn\u2019t. The point is still the same. The sad part is that right after acknowledging that we need to do better, most men did worse. Awesomesauce. Way to be exactly who you said you are.\n\n9. To get back to the title of his piece, the title definitely colored how men or women read the article and either set you up for hatred (men) or \u201cFUCKING FINALLY\u201d (women). I did see how some women said that maybe since a man said it, men would pay attention. Sorry, ladies\u2014that doesn\u2019t seem to be in the cards. Many of these men want to keep on being exactly who they are because while we believe racism exists, apparently sexism is a much harder sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Numbers 1 through 9 are why it wasn\u2019t clickbait, for those of you who struggle with the concept of clickbait.\n\n11. I don\u2019t want it to seem like all men save for, like, four thought the piece was terrible. Some men agreed, some grudgingly or with trepidation in their hearts. Not every man was out here ready to offer over Damon in the race draft. And let\u2019s be real: Not every woman agreed with him, either. But as is usual, the most vocal critics are the loudest and most active. They should ... stop.\n\nLogic. Theory.

I thought it was going to be a boring-ass week\u2014until Taylor Swift \u201csurprise\u201d-dropped her new single from her next album, \u201cReputation,\u201d this past Friday. And, you know, everyone acted as expected, mostly.\n\nTaylor\u2019s detractors fried her accordingly. Half of her stans pretended to like the single, because that is the cross they have chosen to bear, and descended on anyone who didn\u2019t agree like an angry rash. The other half of her stans experienced secondhand embarrassment for a variety of reasons.\n\nMe? I mostly rolled my eyes. Despite her being one of my nemeses (Lena Dunham captains that list), I have long come to accept that Taylor Alison Swift, while mediocre and overhyped, has the tenacity of a roach that keeps skittering back even in the face of nuclear waste and disaster.\n\nHowever, things got interesting when I came across this Rolling Stone article that stated she was taking shots at Kanye West (again). I was annoyed but not shocked. Taylor Swift has demonstrated that she is stuck in high school. With her fake \u201cgirl power\u201d mentality and piss-poor Regina George impression (and aspirations), it does not shock me for a minute that she once again went after Kanye for the purpose of her burn book.\n\nHonestly, she kind of reminds me of that one guy in high school who caught that one game-winning touchdown during the homecoming game of 1992 and comes back to the high school reunion 20 years later, balding, unhappy and still rambling about how the homecoming game of 1992 was the best day of his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nOf course, as humorous as that was in my head, it got me thinking: Kanye aside, why the hell was Taylor not taking shots at Kim Kardashian West, too? I heard the song and even saw the video (I wish I hadn\u2019t, but hey), and besides the \u201ctilted stage\u201d reference, which is an obvious Kanye dig, there\u2019s nothing else (besides the fact that Taylor generically references this unseen person who will get his share of karma. Yawn).\n\n\n\nI mean, if everyone\u2019s keeping tabs, Kim was the one to deal the critical \u201cFatality!\u201d to Taylor\u2019s credibility and, for lack of a better word, reputation. One that was so intense and scorching, it sent her into a long-standing hiatus that absolutely no one gave a fuck about other than her then-\u201cboyfriend\u201d Tom Hiddleston (now ex-boyfriend). Kim was the one who embraced the snake emojis and made it so that she would profit off the Great Exposing of Taylor Swift for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was Kim. Kim did that. So, why isn\u2019t Ms. Tay-Tay clocking her?\n\nEasy answer:\n\nIt\u2019s because the only other person who is able to subvert and defeat a white woman (and her white privilege and white tears) is another fellow white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Why the hell would Taylor go up against Kim again? Even for someone who has as much social capital as she does and is as hyper-Aryan as she is, that would be a recipe for yet another L, precisely for the reasons I just mentioned. And more.\n\n\n\nKim is an ethnic white woman. She has a large net worth, like Taylor. She has social clout and is a social media maven ... like Taylor. Look at her followers across all her social media channels. Hell, she could post a picture of her big toe tomorrow and she would \u201cbreak\u201d the internet. And, ironically, overshadow Regina George-Lite\u2019s brand-spanking-new single.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor wouldn\u2019t dare. She can\u2019t out-white-woman another white woman whose privilege works just as well as hers and carries a lifetime guarantee. So, of course, the next-best target would be the black dude everyone kind of already hates. It\u2019s low-hanging fruit, sure, but it\u2019s safe. And white women like Swift tend to retreat into the safety and protection that their femininity and whiteness afford them when their feelings and egos have been hurt, or they feel that they have been slighted.\n\n\n\nAnd this is why I am still so fascinated by Kim K\u2019s takedown of Regina George Zero ... and, similarly, of the Great Racist Beating of 2017 ... courtesy of internet sensation Colleen Dagg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who have not seen the video or don\u2019t know the story, Dagg recently found herself being a witness to another white woman going on a racist rant about Haitians and black people. After what I assume were words exchanged prior to the camera rolling, the racist white woman placed her hands on Dagg, prompting Dagg to defend herself and, in the words of Terrence Howard, whoop that trick.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd the rest proceeded as normal ... except that\u2019s a lie, because even though we all expected the police to show up, something interesting happened. The racist white woman assumed the victim stance by frothing at the mouth for cops to arrest Dagg, claiming that she was (suddenly) pregnant and that Dagg needed to go to jail for this reason.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIgnoring the fact that the racist was not pregnant when she ran up on Dagg and that her face is what took all the punches\u2014which, itself, was not pregnant\u2014the way the officer on the scene treated her was interesting. Instead of rushing Dagg and presumably arresting her just based on the cries of the hysterical and racist woman, the cop, instead, treated the racist very sternly, telling her to calm down and saying that he wasn\u2019t going to repeat himself. I laughed, honestly. Like, he came in really mad like he had just seen the video.\n\n\n\nAnd the racist was eventually escorted out, and everyone lived happily ever after.\n\nMake no mistake, though. The fact that Dagg got off as clean as she did is something that she could only have pulled off as a fellow white woman. Nothing more, nothing less. The optics would have been incredibly bad if Dagg had been a white man, regardless of the self-defense excuse. And the results would have turned deadly if Dagg had been black. She would have either been escorted away in handcuffs without saying her piece or, quite frankly, ended up dead.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorically, it doesn\u2019t take much.\n\n\n\nHowever, Dagg\u2019s status as a white woman subverted that and avoided all of those inevitable consequences. And she later explained as much on Twitter.\n\nThe \u201cwhite woman in trouble\u201d defense stance cannot work against another white woman. Because then it\u2019s just silly. You know why? Because that historical, racially charged, murderous and manipulative tactic draws its power from being played against a black person or another person of color. It requires the presence of a black body to hurt, and also requires the ears of an insecure white man who more often than not harbors some inadequacy that he has been itching to take out on a black body.\n\nYou take that black body away and replace it with a white female one? Well, white women like Taylor Swift and the racist white woman Colleen Dagg mollywhopped lose their power. They have no leverage, because in going against another white woman who knows the \u201cwhite woman in distress\u201d game very well, they risk getting exposed as who they tend to be:\n\nInsecure little girls.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. What\u2019s the lesson here? Well, referring to all of you pussy-hat-wearing, Women\u2019s March-ing and \u201cnonracist\u201d white women ... the lesson is quite simple:\n\nThis is how you use your privilege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, the next time you see cops specifically targeting black and brown bodies at a protest? Use it. The next time you see a black woman being called a \u201cbully\u201d by another white woman? Use it. The next time you generally witness some gross racial injustice taking place and you know it is within your white woman superpowers to stop it? Use it.\n\n\n\nEspecially in a world post-Charlottesville. I need fewer pussy-hat-wearing white women who pay useless lip service, and more white women like Dagg (and, at times, Kim; you know, without the gross fetishization and appropriation of blackness).\n\nHere\u2019s to fewer \u201callies\u201d and more white woman traitors.", "keywords": ["woman", "swift", "racist", "white", "kim", "women", "dagg", "tale", "taylor", "privilege", "immovable", "black", "know", "unstoppable", "meeting"], "polarity": 0.04766543641543645, "subjectivity": 0.3761328717578716},

The former were the things of God and acceptable for the Christian to participate in. The latter were the things of the world, and I was expected to eschew them.\n\n\n\nBut like I said, I\u2019m not good at being that kind of Christian. I listen to the wrong music; I have a deep affinity for brown liquor (so much so that I wrote this); and, in the words of my friend and frat brother the Rev. Dr. Eric Gill, I love Jesus, but I cuss a little.\n\n\n\nThankfully, I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m not alone.\n\n\n\nBlack millennials (people who, depending on which source you use, were born between 1980 and 2004) are redefining what it means to be a black Christian. Whereas black pastors in years past might have hid the fact that they listened to secular music, many black clergy today do not hide their fondness for hip-hop and R&B. Even notable clergy like Dr. E. Dewey Smith in Atlanta and Dr. Howard-John Wesley in Washington, D.C., have gone so far as to include lyrics of secular songs in some of their sermons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContemporary black Christians are increasingly not ashamed of their blackness, and they are distancing themselves from the respectability politics taught to them by previous generations. Some can twerk better than the most talented employee of your favorite gentlemen\u2019s club, and they will probably move furniture in order to create an impromptu dance floor if you turn on \u201cKnuck if You Buck\u201d or the defining song of my generation: \u201cBack That Azz Up.\u201d\n\n\n\nYet there is one song that will have them all looking at the sky having a private moment in a public place when played: Kanye West\u2019s \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d\u2014the official song of black folks who love Jesus but cuss a little. But a little context on the history of black gospel music is needed to understand how the song both participates in and pushes forward this revered aesthetic tradition.\n\nBlack church folks have been arguing about music for generations. Before the 1960s, black folks sang with passion, but they were largely committed to traditional chord changes and singing out of hymnals. Then, in the 1960s, James Cleveland popularized a blues-inspired form of gospel wherein he incorporated soul, jazz and elements of black pop into mass-choir arrangements. For many black Christians, he was considered too secular, but his contributions to black music cannot be overstated. Cleveland was foundational to the modern gospel sound that permeated black music from the \u201970s to the \u201990s. Then came Kirk Franklin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFranklin\u2019s greatest contribution is the centering of hip-hop, not just in terms of musical style or use of rhyming, but as a broader sensibility,\u201d says Charles Hughes, director of the Memphis Center at Rhodes College and author of Country Soul: Making Music and Making Race in the American South. Hughes explains:\n\n\n\nHe asserted the legitimacy of hip-hop within gospel by demonstrating their clear links, and asserted that gospel\u2019s relevance relied on its ability to communicate with hip-hop listeners. In this way, he was the latest manifestation of a long dynamic within the history of gospel (where iconoclastic artists incorporate new secular sounds) and\u2014like his predecessors\u2014he faced criticism. But, also like his predecessors, he proved prophetic.\n\nIn his 1998 autobiography, Church Boy, Franklin addressed those criticisms:\n\nSome of our strongest critics, especially inside the church, said we had turned our backs on traditional gospel music and were just contemporary R&B artists exploiting Christian lyrics for the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in a 1998 interview in Jet magazine, he further explained: \u201cGospel music is not a sound; gospel music is a message. Gospel music means good news. It\u2019s good-news music.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis last point\u2014that gospel music is, in fact, \u201cgood-news music\u201d\u2014may have attracted Franklin to work with Kanye on \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d\u2014the song to which now we turn.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a God dream.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are curse words spoken on the track, but don\u2019t let that confuse you. \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d is firmly within the gospel music tradition.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been known to be a Ye apologist, but I\u2019m willing to admit that the MC from Chicago can be irritatingly boastful. Even when he pantomimed humility in his first gospel-influenced track, \u201cJesus Walks,\u201d Ye could not keep himself from indulging his hubris. That\u2019s why the first track from The Life of Pablo caught me off guard. This is a song written by a man who is humble enough to understand that he needs the divine.\n\n\n\nA minimalistic electronic sound is seamlessly interwoven with moments of call and response that is ubiquitous in the black church, but it is Kelly Price\u2019s Pentecostal passion on the first verse that immediately brings black gospel to mind. Meanwhile, Chance the Rapper, the official MC of niggas who love God but curse a little, is virtuosic in the third verse. In his signature singsong delivery, he starts the verse quietly until it builds to a crescendo, all while discussing his aesthetic and spiritual journey as a hip-hop artist who refuses to bow to demands of industry executives. The song ends with a raspy, breathless prayer from Franklin, whose brilliance, as explicated above, charted the trajectory of gospel music over the past 30 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cUltralight Beam\u201d took me and many other black millennials into the presence of God like few songs can. It is self-assured yet humble, genre-bending while respecting and participating in black folk traditions.

After clicking on about the 12th video geared toward women and our natural-hair needs, our guy friend blurted out, \u201cWhat about MY hair\u2019s protein?!\u201d\n\n\n\nYou see, he\u2019s recently become interested in keeping his 4c coils healthy, and tossed around the idea of growing it out longer than his current cropped style. After rolling our eyes at his whining, we started to think about the growing number of men who care about their hair health, and how it may be difficult to find a similar community and shared knowledge geared toward their needs.\n\nBig names in natural-hair products, like Shea Moisture, Form (from the minds behind Bevel) and Oyin, have all extended their product lines to cater to the needs of men. The natural-hair movement seems to be recognizing that there is room for the fellas, too, and the DIY culture of social media is following suit.

One of Ferrer\u2019s followers posted a picture of her young son, explaining that he was being teased for his long hair and had been asking to cut it until seeing Ferrer\u2019s page and videos. The golden-hearted guru confirmed that was exactly the reason he started his social media pages: to inspire other young boys to love themselves and ignore the negativity.\n\nWinstonee brings healthy hair habits and style techniques to the gentleman who isn\u2019t looking to grow his strands to the ground.

He wants to remove the gender headers from beauty and promote the message that black hair is good hair, however we choose to wear it. \u201cHair does not have a gender, and neither should the products,\u201d Pearson commented. \u201cI let my hair speak for itself. When most people watch my videos, they don\u2019t really concern themselves with my gender.

An Atlanta-based fitness enthusiast, Barnes is honest about his struggle to live for himself and go after his purpose regardless of any public opinion. With videos on twist-out and stretching techniques posted already, this gentleman is off to a great start in helping men with their questions about grooming and hair care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent video, Barnes leaves his followers with an ever important reminder about loving and living for yourself: \u201cIf we\u2019re always wondering and worried about what other people may think about us, we will never move forward in life and progress.\u201d We hope to see more of this positive personality as he becomes more comfortable sharing his journey.\n\nWhat I love the most about Humphrey\u2019s page is that he takes men\u2019s hair way past the wash-and-go styles we\u2019ve come to expect\u2014trying box braids, Bantu knots and beaded cornrows. With a hilarious personality and \u201cinstant bestie\u201d vibe, Will brings his followers hairstyle tutorials, product suggestions and routine rundowns.

Thankfully, he heard our cry and gave a detailed walkthrough of his shape, cut and clean routine for his full brows as the very first video posted to his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, McDonald has brought followers along for the ride as he started college, got played by Tinder dates and shared his roommate horror stories. After two years of his life and hair updates (including video cameos with his siblings), we feel as if we\u2019re officially part of the McDonald family. To call this rising star a natural-hair guru seems a bit limiting, since his channel definitely tackles more than just hair tutorials.

Collectively, they\u2019ve undergone a bit of a cultural reckoning, as there has never been a hotter spotlight on their role in propagating, nurturing and fighting to maintain white supremacy. Even those who claim to be allies are becoming progressively less immune to criticism for their tone-deafness and their tendency to center themselves and their feelings over everything.\n\nPerhaps most emblematic of this particular type of conspicuous whiteness is Taylor Swift, who last year revealed herself to be 1) a fraud and 2) a fraud eager to take advantage of the interminable benefit of the doubt her white-womanness and celebrity provide to throw a black person (Kanye West) under the bus. I talked about this last year:\n\nNo one is better at this type of specifically White female performative faux melodrama\u2014where status is cultivated and maintained through a state of perpetual exaggerated victimhood (which everyone laps up because \u201csad White woman\u201d = \u201cLet\u2019s find our fucking capes and save her!\u201d)\u2014than she is. You know that co-worker (let\u2019s call her \u201cSusan\u201d) who somehow managed to use her offense at a minor breach in email etiquette (someone forgot to put an exclamation point on a sentence, which made Susan \u201cinterpret\u201d it as a \u201cthreat\u201d) as fuel for a raise and a promotion? Taylor Swift is Darth Susan.\n\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the first single off of her upcoming Reputation, reiterates this theme, referring to a totally not-mysterious-at-all \u201cyou\u201d while ensconcing itself in victimhood like a top sheet smothered by appropriated throw pillows. It\u2019s as if her grade of uncut whiteness is so bright that it\u2019s blinding her gaslighting ass to the fact that we have receipts. We know who you are, Taylor. We don\u2019t believe you anymore. You need more people.\n\nAdding insult to Beckery is the preview for the yet-to-be-released video accompanying the single. Which, when considering the subject matter, would seem to be a clear allusion to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade. In a vacuum, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.

Not only is that sexist, but it defies logic. Women are not to blame for men\u2019s wrongdoings. That thought process was sexist in the 19th century and still is today.\n\nKardashian-West is neither a societal victim nor a perpetrator, but we have somehow continually made her the latter. It doesn't escape me that our general dislike of her often causes us to do one of two things: either immediately reject everything she is saying as a fundamental untruth, and/or make her culpable for any act or statement made by her egomaniacal, self-centered husband. Both are deeply rooted in misogyny\u2014that is, the hatred, condemnation and prejudice of women and girls.\n\nI am not a Kardashian-West fan and I never have been. While I have come to appreciate her being financially savvy enough to capitalize on the American public's nonexpectations of her, it is also clear that she initially had to put forth minimal effort to reach her level of success. Part of me honors her for the entrepreneur that she is, while the other part of me is frustrated that many black women who work tirelessly will never achieve a similar success. I have learned to sit with that tension because it is apparently what it takes to be successful in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people feel this way about the reality star-turned-media mogul. And because of it, even in matters of life and death, there seems to be some unspoken agreement that no one should believe a word that comes out of her mouth. More specifically, she should never, under any circumstances, be seen as anything other than that \u201cwhite girl\u201d in a porn flick with Brandy\u2019s brother who ruined Kanye West.\n\nThe widespread concern for Kanye West is as valid as the blame for his actions is misplaced. Many of us have questioned his latest antics\u2014from storming offstage when Beck won Album of the Year at the 2015 Grammy Music Awards (of course, Beyonc\u00e9 should have won) to announcing his 2020 candidacy for president. But nothing quite prompted \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to Kanye?\u201d as much as his meeting with President-elect Donald Trump after his own hospitalization. It became abundantly clear that Kanye West wants to be accepted by white people, even racist ones, no matter how it makes him appear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese cries for attention, however, are not just evidence of stunted emotional growth and low self-esteem\u2014nor are they evidence of the \"Kardashian curse.\" Kanye West's very public spiral has justifiably led to speculation about his mental health. This is critical to note here because mental illness is not a game that can be played in 140 characters or less, and even the potential of it is nothing to take lightly.\n\nRapper Kid Cudi recently announced that he checked himself into rehab for anxiety and depression. This sparked important conversations online about mental health care in the black community. Because of the \u201cweakness\u201d stigma associated with mental illness, living with it is a reality that many black men don\u2019t want to envision, let alone accept. Considering the reasons that mental illness affects black men differently\u2014and the lack of resources\u2014we must address how accessing mental health care can save lives.\n\nWe can do this, however, while having an honest dialogue about the harm that Kanye West is causing himself and possibly those around him. Toxicity and male fragility should not be dismissed as nothing more than by-products of mental illness. Absent a diagnosis, we really shouldn't assume that mental illness is present at all, let alone that it's the cause of his behavior. To do so would not only be presumptuous; too often it's also a dangerous, albeit unintentional way of perpetuating entrenched societal stigmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis narrative often leaves a lot more people hurt rather than healed, and it paves the way for men like Kanye West\u2014whose self-destructive fixation with whiteness has been increasingly evident since he shared his ugly, dark, twisted fantasy\u2014to avoid criticism or accountability.\n\nBecause of Kim Kardashian-West\u2019s mutually obsessive relationship with the mainstream media, many people don\u2019t even entertain the notion that she may also be struggling with the man her husband has become\u2014and, in many ways, the character he has always presented to the world in varying degrees. Like others, I miss the \u201cold\u201d Kanye West, too, but the \u201cnew\u201d Kanye West isn\u2019t because of Kim Kardashian-West; it\u2019s because his old and new selves are finally catching up with each other, begging him to take care of his own fractured mental and emotional well-being.\n\nMental illness or not, our favorite college dropout clearly has a hole inside him that is vast and endless. That inner turmoil did not start with his wife, and it won\u2019t end with her, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are witnessing, in real time, a man losing himself and making it social media fodder. Too many of us are Kurt Cobain-ing him and Amy Winehouse-ing him because there is no genius, even if self-ordained, more beloved than a dead one. And if Kanye West doesn\u2019t get the help he needs, a very public death could be his final curtain call.\n\nNot even Kim Kardashian-West can be held responsible for that.", "keywords": ["west", "fkery", "kardashian", "blamed", "white", "kim", "women", "mental", "kardashianwest", "kanye", "black", "illness", "men"], "polarity": 0.09736333927510397, "subjectivity": 0.4415760546642898},

It followed years of annoyance at his trend of constantly obnoxious and solipsistic behavior. Even his admission during a recent concert that he didn\u2019t vote at all Nov. 8 but would have voted for Donald Trump\u2014as many of his fans struggle to grasp the reality of our incoming president\u2014barely made me bat an eye. Just Kanye being Kanye.\n\nBut his Nov. 19 show in Sacramento, Calif., during which he went on a 17-minute rant before bouncing after performing fewer than five songs, was a bridge too far for me. It wasn\u2019t the shots at MTV and DJ Khaled. It wasn\u2019t the reference to Kid Cudi and himself as \u201caliens.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the renewed public butthurt at Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z, at whom he\u2019s still apparently pissed for not respecting him to the degree he feels he deserves.\n\nWhat did me in was thinking about the Sacramento fans who paid upward of $200 for a ticket\u2014some of whom certainly switched work shifts, hired baby sitters and spent dollars that were very significant to them\u2014to see an artist they loved. I couldn\u2019t reconcile that with garden-variety Kanye arrogance, so I cracked my fingers and hit my keyboard, intent on leaning in on him.\n\nAbout halfway through my first draft, news came down that he had canceled the rest of his Saint Pablo Tour and was hospitalized following the Sacramento performance, ostensibly for \u201cexhaustion.\u201d I was left staring at my keyboard, thinking, \u201cGoddammit, maybe he\u2019s not a complete a\u2014hole.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Kanye is suffering from a legitimate psychosis, diagnosed or not, it opens up a litany of questions involving his behavior as a whole. But it also demands that I, as a human being who bleeds when cut, approach his situation from a point of compassion that I wasn\u2019t ready to have for him.\n\nIt speaks volumes about Kanye\u2019s pop culture imprint that he engenders more conversation these days about his behavior and the motives behind it than his actual product. Everyone, ranging from armchair therapists (read: all of social media) to people actually trained to know what the f\u2014k they\u2019re talking about, have conjectured that something hasn\u2019t been kosher in Kanye\u2019s noodle since his mother\u2019s untimely death in 2007.\n\nOn the one hand, I recognize that, as a society, we tend to be too blas\u00e9 and dismissive of mental-health issues\u2014citing them when it benefits our narrative and dismissing them when it does not. It was refreshing to see us embrace Kid Cudi for his bold, candid admissions of his mental-health struggles (and also refreshing to see us jump on Drake for clowning Cudi\u2019s challenges, even if for a hot second).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s remarkably difficult for me to forgive much of Kanye\u2019s behavior as manifestations of mental illness. The whole Taylor Swift business. The puerile public comments he made about a woman he once loved. The consistently aberrant and narcissistic social behavior that always seems to precede an apparent self-awareness through his mea culpas.\n\nAnd I\u2019d be remiss not to admit that I do indeed miss the old Kanye very much. That Kanye was also arrogant, but he backed it up with an uncanny flair for manipulating soul samples that would come to define his early mainstream sound and make him one of the 10 best hip-hop producers of all time.\n\nHe was a true hip-hop fan in the first decade of his career, giving his all to produce entire albums for local Chicago artists and ultimately for his heroes, pioneers of turn-of-the-century boom-bap like Common, Talib Kweli and the erstwhile Mos Def. His first three albums are debatable classics, and he\u2019s the mastermind behind my single favorite hip-hop track of this century\u2019s first decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he\u2019s spent a lot of energy conforming to (bad) mainstream rap as of late. The one-two punch of G.O.O.D. Friday loosie tracks and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was the last time I got truly hype about his output, and they were released back when Barack Obama was still developing his sea legs in the White House.\n\nThe old Kanye is indeed dead, having apparently left this plane along with his mother; most of his off-the-hook behavior seems to have occurred in the nine years since Donda West passed. The mere thought of losing my mother at this age brings pressure to my body, so I wouldn\u2019t deign to attempt to understand his feelings, given the Nov. 10 anniversary of that event.\n\nIf the Sacramento rant was a manifestation of that anniversary\u2014as many have speculated\u2014then I feel bad that a breakdown had to occur so publicly, and I hope the Kardasharati take good care of him \u2026 especially for the sake of his children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I maintain that Kanye has to truly atone for some of his behavior\u2014if not to his fans, then to the Amber Roses of the world who deserve it. Here\u2019s hoping he comes out of this dark hole a better artist and a better human being.\n\nDustin J. Seibert lifts heavyweights and plays all his video games on hard mode to find peace.

So we intend to enforce our laws.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone might want to let Sessions know that Nikolas Cruz, the accused gunman in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting, purchased his gun legally, which proves that current gun laws might be ineffective.\n\nBut Sessions wouldn\u2019t be Sessions if he didn\u2019t find a way to bring up gang violence\u2014which, unless Sessions is talking about the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d gang, which Cruz appeared to belong to, really has no place in this discussion.\n\n\u201cWhen parents once again go to sleep fearful that their kids will not be safe, even when they go to school\u2014parents have told me in gang-infested neighborhoods that children can no longer stand at the bus stop by themselves\u2014they take turns, parents do, of being out there every morning and afternoon,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve gotta confront the problem. There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess it doesn\u2019t matter to Sessions that Parkland is not a place terrorized by gang violence. Or that Parkland was just named Florida\u2019s safest city in 2017, according to an analysis by the Washington-based National Council for Home Safety and Security.\n\nI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for the Trump administration to call homegrown terrorism by its name. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think that the current administration emboldens this brand of hate and then preys on white America\u2019s fear by pulling out tired tropes about gang violence to avoid the obvious issues of homegrown hate and unbridled access to guns.\n\nWatch below:", "keywords": ["shooting", "racist", "jeff", "gun", "laws", "sessions", "symphony", "parkland", "speech", "violence", "think", "know", "florida", "whistles", "gang", "way", "nonsensical", "school"], "polarity": -0.06926666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.5059333333333333},

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield. If everyone has guns, bullets will be flying everywhere.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["organization", "dont", "terrorist", "nra", "gun", "directly", "second", "nras", "deaths", "right", "legal"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

She's also Snapchat. (To me at least.)\n\nShe's Snapchat? What do you mean?\n\nI recognize that Snapchat is a thing that is a very popular thing. I am not unaware of its function and cultural relevance. But I have no interest whatsoever in learning more about it. Even if that knowledge might benefit me. I've officially opted out of Snapchat.\n\nThese feelings kinda, sorta mirror my thoughts about Taylor Swift. I know she is a very popular and important singer of songs and writer of songs. But if you put a gun to my head and asked me to name five Taylor Swift songs, I'd be confused that your choice to shoot me was based on such arbitrarily specific criteria. And then I'd wonder how you even got into my house. And how my bitch-ass pit bull allowed you to come upstairs without even barking. But then you'd have to shoot me. Because aside from some song that I think is called \"Shake It Off\" or something, I couldn't name any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could however name people she's been romantically linked to. Right now she's with the emo guy from Thor. Before that she was with the producer dude who I always assumed was Black because he has a Black-sounding name. (And apparently that's not even his real name! And apparently he chose that name specifically because its Black sounding!) And there's also the werewolf guy from Twilight. And then there's\u2026eh, nevermind. You don't really care about all of this. And neither do I. She's rich and famous so she dates rich and famous men. Whatever.\n\nThank you for cutting that paragraph short. I was thisclose to dozing off. So anyway, why is she in the news today?\n\nEarlier this year, Kanye West released an album that everyone cared about for like five weeks. But now, five months later, the only song on it that still matters is a song (\"Panda\") that wasn't even his song. This is an awkward time on Yeezus Island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, on that album was a song (\"Famous\") that began with the following lines:\n\n\n\nFor all my Southside niggas that know me best\n\nI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\n\nWhy? I made that bitch famous\n\nTaylor, of course, is Taylor Swift. The \"made that bitch famous\" part is a reference to Kanye's infamous interruption of Swift's Best Female Video acceptance speech at the 2009 VMAs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would Kanye even put that on his album? I thought he wanted everyone to like him?\n\nEvery once in a while, my seven-month-old daughter will spit in my face when I'm holding her. And then she'll laugh, baring both of her tiny-ass teeth like it's the funniest thing ever. I was perplexed about it at first. (\"Why does it always hit me in my right eye?\" \"Is there a pattern for this? Does she only do it Wednesday? Or after she's eaten avocado? Is this her way of expressing her distaste for avocado?\") Until I just decided not to be perplexed anymore because she's seven months old and there's literally no \"reason\" that would make any sense.\n\nThis is how I feel about attempting to determine Kanye's motives for doing things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. So, how did Taylor take it?\n\nNaturally, Taylor Swift took it TaylorSwiftly. Never one to pass up an opportunity to make herself a martyr, Swift alluded to Kanye and \"Famous\" during her Album of the Year acceptance speech at this year's Grammys.\n\n\n\n\"As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there: There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one is better at this type of specifically White female performative faux melodrama \u2014 where status is cultivated and maintained through a state of perpetual exaggerated victimhood (which everyone laps up because \"sad White woman\" = \"Let's find our fucking capes and save her!\") \u2014 than she is.\n\nYou know that co-worker (let's call her \"Susan\") who somehow managed to use her offense at a minor breach in email etiquette (someone forgot to put an exclamation point on a sentence, which made Susan \"interpret\" it as a \"threat\") as fuel for a raise and a promotion?\n\nTaylor Swift is Darth Susan.\n\nKanye, however, would later tweet that he actually reached out to Taylor about the lyric before incorporating it in his song. And that she thought it was funny and was cool with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich suggests the following:\n\n1. They're friends. Or, rather, friendly enough to have this conversation.\n\n2. The entire Grammy speech was an act.\n\n3. She's more than willing to throw a friend under the bus for the opportunity to performative martyr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Taylor vehemently denied that this conversation ever happened. And, of course, most of the country seemed to believe Taylor. Because Kanye is the scary Black dude. And Taylor, again, is Darth Susan.\n\nSo what happened next?\n\nOne advantage I presume of being romantically involved with a Kardashian is that everything seems to be recorded. Conversations, weddings, grocery shopping, sex, shits \u2014- everything. Which means you'll never have to go without receipts. \"Kardashian\" is actually Swahili for \"White woman with receipts.\" And since Kim has all the receipts, she released footage of Taylor Swift doing exactly what Kanye said she did. Agreeing to the lyrics and expressing her appreciation that Kanye reached out first before publishing them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo she was caught in a boldfaced lie, huh? How did she respond?\n\nWith a statement \u2014 a statement that suspiciously seems prewritten \u2014 where she expressed that she never said she didn't talk to him (a lie) and never agreed to Kanye's use of \"bitch.\"\n\nDo you believe her?\n\nNo. She needs more people. Like, imagine the longest TSA line you've ever seen. She needs all of those people. Plus each of those people's peoples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, not only do I not believe her, I believe she's exposed herself as one of the most dangerous types of White woman.\n\nDangerous? How?\n\nThe stakes here are relatively low. Perhaps there might be some legal involvement because of California privacy laws, but ultimately this involves three unfathomably rich and famous and annoying people who will continue to be unfathomably rich and famous and annoying. But what Taylor did is a form of what Darth Susans have been doing since America's inception. Using the inherent empathy and benefit of the doubt her White womanhood allows her to possess \u2014 plus the reflexive need to protect and preserve the sanctity of said White womanhood at all costs \u2014 to throw a Black person under the bus if necessary and convenient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016, Darth Susans get people fired. In 1916, Darth Susans got people lynched.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nShe'll produce an album about this, win a bunch of awards, and have her Grammy acceptance speech interrupted by North West throwing a sippy cup at her. A sippy cup filled with\u2026Lemonade!

But that doesn't explain why her name is the top trending topic today. I'm sure she's a lovely woman, but there has to be something else, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes! There definitely is something else. There are a shitload of something elses. This time last year, Ayesha was arguably the 6th most famous member of the Curry family, behind Steph, her daughter Riley (last year's sports media darling), her father-in-law Dell (a former NBA player), her brother-in-law Seth (a current NBA player), and even her mother-in-law Sonya \u2014 who received quite a bit of fans during Steph's college career during her stint as \"The Hottest March Madness Mom Of All-Time.\" Shit, even Panda Express Curry Tofu Fried Rice was more popular than Ayesha.\n\nTo be clear, none of this is meant to be shade. She just was not in pop culture's general consciousness then. She was just known as the cute young mom who made YouTube videos; another member of the impossibly (and annoyingly) perfect Curry family.\n\nBut then in December, she tweeted something about how she chooses to dress versus how, um, \"other\" women choose to dress:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets served as the fuel for A Very Important Internet Conversation About Gender Roles And Slut Shaming that quickly devolved into a internet battle royale. Bones were shattered, lives were lost, and fuckboys were exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what exactly was the problem with what she said? Why were people so upset?\n\nAlthough Curry's tweets may have seemed like the innocent Saturday evening words of a wealthy Bay Area housewife expressing her thoughts about the Talbots spring collection, they were kinda sorta thinly veiled shots at women who dress more provocatively. Like, if I walked up into a hospital and said \"Everyone's into being sick here, huh? Well, personally I like to stay virus-free\" it would be considered a shot at sick people. Same thing.\n\nThat was a terrible analogy.\n\nI know. But you get my point. Anyway, Curry's tweet started a relatively sane \u2014 at least by internet standards \u2014 debate about whether her tweets were subtle shots (they were), if there's anything wrong with her deciding to be a housewife (there isn't), and if slut-shaming was a bad thing (it is). But then \"Nuance-Less Twitter\" \u2014 which is primarily made up of the cousins whose Facebook friend requests you ignore \u2014 got a hold of this conversation, and made Curry their muse for their ongoing battle against the evil of feminism. And logic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"How are men supposed to find a wife these days\" they'd say \"if upstanding females like Ayesha Curry get less respect than thots?\"\n\nAnd then, over the next few months, Ayesha Curry became a perfect woman proxy; the best example of the type of (presumably) virtuous and (presumably) virginal woman that 1) every woman should aspire to be and 2) exists as a perfect counterpoint or contrast to any woman deemed unvirtuous and thotnificent.\n\nAnd of course, while University of Phoenix Twitter professed their love and appreciation for Ayesha and \"women like Ayesha\" (not that there's anything wrong with being like Ayesha Curry) the part about men being like a man who was wealthy, popular, tall, and attractive at 25 and chose to get married \u2014 you know, like how Steph did \u2014 is conveniently left out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is she trending today?\n\nBecause transubstantiated cash register Kim Kardashian recently tweeted a nude selfie. Which, at this point, is like Tyler Perry writing a script about a career-minded woman with dating issues and a homicidal grandmother. We've seen this movie already, man.\n\nUnfortunately, the selfie became an impetus for another internet battle royale, as a meme juxtapositioning her picture with a picture of Ayesha Curry went viral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message, of course, being that one of these women is fit to be a wife and mother, and one is not, and women are either one or the other. Which is a terrible fucking message for myriad reasons, including the fact that it FORCES PEOPLE TO SPEND VALUABLE TIME AND EFFORT AND MINDSPACE DEFENDING KIM KARDASHIAN! Of course, nothing is wrong with being Kim Kardashian. (Really, there isn't.) Still, no one outside of Yeezus Island wakes up in the morning thinking \"I'm going to write a defense of Kim Kardashian today\" but these social promotion motherfuckers are so analog that they force you to.\n\nSo what happens now?\n\nSane people will continue to believe that there's absolutely nothing wrong with being Ayesha Curry or someone like Ayesha Curry. And that the only thing wrong is when a certain type of woman is considered \"better\" than another type of woman just because she shops at Banana Republic and tweets smoothie recipes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Ayesha Curry will continue to be the perfect woman proxy for people \u2014 men and women \u2014 with (at best) regressive and (at worst) completely fucking idiotic and dangerous views about how women should be.\n\nBasically, nothing will change.", "keywords": ["woman", "kardashian", "kim", "problematic", "women", "perfect", "inane", "wrong", "explained", "curry", "tweets", "ayesha", "increasingly", "obsession", "wife"], "polarity": 0.06423623995052564, "subjectivity": 0.6108482787054215},

Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400).

But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin. It is a stain on all our hands.

Also, on at least one occasion in 2008, it was an effective pickup line for me. (\u201cI\u2019m the hero you deserve, girl.\u201d)\n\nAs I think about this line today, I can\u2019t help also thinking about two very famous families: The Obamas and the Kardashians.\n\nWhy? Well, as I type this, Malia Obama is probably sitting in some advanced-astrophysics or Toni Morrison critical-theory class; debating attending Harvard or Yale or Spelman next year; or just postponing school altogether to become the first 18-year-old Black astronaut. Her little sister, Sasha, is probably skipping school. But not to catch a movie or hang out at Arby\u2019s with Natalie, but to volunteer at a homeless shelter and then to head to the library to continue working on the dystopian and empowering young-adult series she\u2019s been writing in her spare time.\n\nTheir mother, Michelle, is probably in the gym training for an intercontinental CrossFit tournament while texting legal advice to Sonia Sotomayor (and looking flawless the entire time). While their dad, Barack, is probably in the White House basement, doing Mikan drills with a group of surprisingly ambidextrous Martians, who fly all the way to Earth once a week to chop it up with the prez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat the Obama family is America\u2019s official first family will never not be absurd. Not because they\u2019re Black but because they\u2019re so damn perfect. They\u2019re each impossibly smart and tall, and the kids are ridiculously cute and talented and well mannered, and they all appear to adore one another. Oh, and they\u2019re Black. Beautifully and unambiguously Black. So Black that they actually have a \u201cBig Momma\u201d (Michelle\u2019s mother) living with them. And the names of their daughters could very easily also be the names of days in Kwanzaa. It is literally not possible to have a more perfect first family. We will never do better than them.\n\nAnd we? Well\u2026We are a country full of idiots, sociopaths, gun nuts, homophobes, hoteps, chicken hawks, chicken thieves, racists, Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood cast members and Cowboys fans. A year from now, we might actually elect the monkey squirrel who hosts The Celebrity Apprentice as our actual president. Our national pastimes are Netflix and chill and eating bacon.\n\nYou know that guy at the Golden Corral who goes back to the buffet with the plate he just ate from, even though they explicitly tell you to get a new plate every time you get food? And then, with steak bones and cheese crumbs still on his plate, hovers over the seafood line and grabs an entire tray of breaded shrimp before anyone else can even get some?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat guy is America.\n\nThe Obamas are not the heroes we deserve. Because we do not deserve them. The only thing we deserve is diabetes.\n\nWhich is why, when Cosmopolitan called the Kardashians \u201cAmerica\u2019s First Family,\u201d I couldn\u2019t be too upset. In fact, I wasn\u2019t upset at all. Because they were right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf our first family is supposed to be an accurate representation of the American people, who\u2019d be a better choice than this absurd, problematic and inexplicably wealthy crew of bad-rapper-enabling Instagram mavens from Hidden Hills, Calif.? Who\u2019d be a more appropriate leader than the dangerously opportunistic Kris, and who\u2019d be a more effective diplomat than the aggressively and impressively vapid Kim?\n\nThey are, like it or not, the most American family in America right now. We want to see the Obamas when we look in the mirror. But all the reflection will show us is Khloe Kardashian leaving a Hollywood Waffle House with French Montana; a selfie stick in one hand and a take-home bag of soggy waffles and half-assed soy sausage in the other.\n\nThe Kardashians might not be the heroes we need right now. (Or ever, for that matter.) But they are who we deserve.

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more. But the fact is, the FBI was warned last year about how Nikolas Cruz posted that he wanted to be a professional school shooter!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the president spoke Thursday around 11:30 a.m. EST, he took all of six-and-a-half-minutes to address the tragedy. That\u2019s less time than he took to rant about NFL players kneeling; that\u2019s less time than he took to praise alleged wife beater and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter; that\u2019s barely more time than it takes for Doug E. Fresh to go on.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t name any of the victims; nor did he praise the brave students or teachers. He spent most of his limited time giving an \u201cafter-school special\u201d lecture about how you never need to be alone in high school\u2014and if you\u2019re sad, there is someone you should reach out to. It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns. If Tim Gunn had jumped in front of him, ripped off his well-tailored sleeves, flexed and screamed, \u201cWhat do you think of these??\u201d Trump would still have found a way to say, \u201cHow\u2019s that mental health going?\u201d\n\nMental health has become the ultimate red herrng for Republicans who don\u2019t want to talk about guns no matter who gets shot, or how bloody or egregious and avoidable the crime may have been. The country is full of people with \u201cmental health problems,\u201d and they aren\u2019t shooting up schools every week. You know who is shooting up schools and nightclubs and office buildings every week? People who are legally allowed to buy AR-15s. Fix that problem and maybe we can stop with the disingenuous chorus of tweets citing \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d every 60 hours.\n\nAlas, we know that Trump won\u2019t do anything; nor will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Speaker Paul Ryan. When Republicans can get shot up at their own baseball game and still refuse to pass meaningful gun legislation, there\u2019s no reason to think that another shooting of innocent kids will spur them to action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as student survivor David Hogg just told CNN, somebody has to act like adults.\n\nSince Trump isn\u2019t an adult, and neither are the Republicans in Congress, it\u2019s time for the public to act like adults and vote these gun-fetishizing incompetents out of office this fall\u2014and then demand some real change.", "keywords": ["republicans", "dont", "shooting", "listened", "thats", "president", "mental", "speech", "took", "cares", "shootings", "trump", "pretend", "health", "school"], "polarity": 0.08694761904761902, "subjectivity": 0.45011904761904753},

It is 8:12 am. Which means it's been less than nine hours since I watched the VMAs. In that time span I ate (approximately) seven lukewarm tator tots, drank two glasses of water, slept for six hours, walked my dog, and took The Wife Person\u2122 to work.\n\nI also tried (and failed) to remember any music from last night.\n\nI remember that people on my television screen were performing songs. I remember seeing Kool Moe Dee perform with Macklemore, and I remember thinking that his \"Wild Wild West\" money must've dried up. Or perhaps, I also thought, maybe he spent it all on a really nice deck 20 years ago. And maybe a deer died on that deck a couple months ago. And it was a really tragic death. Like, imagine if The Notebook was made with deer instead of humans. And Deer Noah died at 32. That's how tragic it was. And the memory of the dead deer on the deck haunts him so much that he needed to tear down the old deck and build a new one. And he needed some cash for that. And that's why he agreed to perform with Macklemore.\n\nAnyway, I remember most of the performances, but I don't actually remember any of the music. I don't necessarily believe that watching a three hour long music awards show and not remembering any of the music is a bad thing. But there's no way to argue that this is a good thing, either.\n\n2. Nicki Minaj's Pastor Lydia may very well be an amazing woman. Maybe she smells like RA African Pure Raw Shea Butter, looks like Gina Torres, makes red velvet pancakes from scratch, is a volunteer firewoman, and can twerk. But she is also the shittiest pastor on the planet. Although I've never stepped foot in her church or heard her preach, I say this with the utmost confidence. Because, if a person makes a point to shout out her pastor on national television literally five seconds before she does some \"Well\u2026Jesus aint done with me yet\" shit, this person's pastor is a terrible, awful, terrible pastor. Like, if a man who's seeing a marriage counselor cheats on his wife, fine. Shit happens. Doesn't make the marriage counselor a bad marriage counselor. But if dude's at Applebee's happy hour, and announces to the bar that his \"marriage counselor is the best marriage counselor ever\" moments before he fucks the hostess behind the coat check counter, and you happened to be at that bar, you'd leave thinking \"Damn. That marriage counselor must be a shitty marriage counselor.\"\n\n3. And no, what happened wasn't staged. Nicki Minaj raining all of South Jamaica Queens \u2014 every bodega, every hyena-sized rat with personality and a pension, every middle school randomly and confusingly numbered in the 100s \u2014 on Miley Cyrus was not planned. At least not planned by MTV. Or Miley Cyrus. (Who, to her credit, did manage to roll with that punch about as well as you can expect in a situation like that.) And you know it wasn't staged because, if you watch her speech again, you can see her taking a bit of an anxious pause/breath before she went in. The same type of anxious pause/breath Kanye took before going in on Bush at the telethon a decade ago. Which veteran read mavens recognize as an \"Uh oh. Someone get a plunger, cause some shit's about to go down.\" tell. Apparently the Minaj household is tired of being at the butt end of beef.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Kanye West is a human Rorschach test. Also, the backlash from the incident with Taylor Swift six years ago seems to have hurt him much, much, much more than any of us thought. That apparently (and surprisingly) traumatized him.\n\nAnd Kim Kardashian somehow manages to consistently look like both a mature 14-year-old trying to look older and an immature 54-year-old trying to look younger at the same time. They are both so bizarre and surreal that I can't imagine either of them being with anyone other than each other.\n\nAnd this is all I'm going to say about Kanye and Kim.\n\n5. Taylor Swift is often compared to \"Regina George\" \u2014 the queen bee mean girl from Mean Girls. It's an observation both the media and even other artists have made. But I don't think it's entirely accurate. She does seem to be the princess of the music industry (Beyonce, obviously, is the queen, and Rihanna is the deuce of spades), but her force of personality is less intimidation and obvious machination and more passive-aggressive petty with a smile. Always with a smile. Or a pout. Because she's just so damn nice and sweet and perfect that how could you, possibly, not like her?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, she's \"Helen Harris III\" \u2014 Rose's Byrne's passive-aggressive princess from Bridesmaids.\n\n6. I was going to say something about how the 2015 VMAs were an intentional showcase for White cluelessness, as seemingly every popular White artist who's recently been accused of some form of racial insensitivity was featured on the show. Someone even placed an infrared filter over the outdoor stage so Iggy Azelea could be in the daylight without evaporating into two hundred million shitty sounding crystals. But then I realized this wasn't intentional. Because if you only featured the White pop stars who haven't been racially problematic, you'd be left with\u2026Katy Perry? Pink? Joe Biden? I don't know.\n\n7. I might have to discontinue my one-man vendetta against Big Sean, the charter school gym class of rap music. While I still believe he raps like his testicles haven't dropped yet, all things considered, he seems like a likable guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Jared Leto's intro of The Weeknd's performance \u2014 and Miley's orgasmic reaction to him \u2014 suggest that The Weeknd is the sexist man alive. That listening to his music makes women ovulate and men enroll in graduate programs. My Twitter timeline, however, told a different story. Because, according to the vast majority of the 1425 people followed by @VerySmartBros, The Weeknd is human Ambien. I have no dog in this fight, but I do think this qualifies as a paradox.\n\n9. Anyway, back to Miley. She is perhaps the world's only vaudevillian millennial. Which would seem like a contradiction. But fits her, because she is a contradiction. She dresses and performs like she's following steps 1 through 23 in a rote catalogue of \"Ways To Be Controversial.\" She'd come on stage dressed as a giant clitoris chained to a whale clitoris if she thought that'd be entertaining. But she sounds and carries herself like she's 57 years old. Seriously, if you just closed your eyes and listened to the diction and confidence and performative world-weariness of her voice, you'd think her name was Maude or Meryl instead of Miley. If Nicki Minaj would have said what she said to her to Taylor Swift instead, Swift would have disintegrated into a puddle of the saddest, Whitest tears that have ever teared. But while Miley tried to deflect with that \"taken out of context\" line, she didn't exactly cower or back down either. And I do, grudgingly, respect that.\n\n10. It's been (approximately) 90 minutes since I first started writing this. And I still don't remember any of the music from last night. I do remember, however, that the best music video I've ever seen \u2014 \"Never Catch Me\" by Flying Lotus feat. Kendrick Lamar \u2014 was released in the last calendar year. And did not receive any mention on a live show recognizing the best music videos of the year.

The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection.

The next day, he tweeted \u201cThe jews are everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. \u201cMuslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs HuffPost shows, leading up to the double murder, Nicholas openly identified as a Nazi, retweeted pro-Hitler memes, and called for various neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups to come together as part of a \u201cwhite revolution.\u201d\n\nHis social media track record is disturbing, but in a way that has become increasingly familiar.\n\nThis is the part of the HuffPost report that has me messed up:\n\n\u201cI apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,\u201d said one of Giampa\u2019s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. \u201cIn the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood. A young man whose mother, who reportedly voiced support for Confederate generals and monuments on her Facebook page, took her son to a gun range to fire a submachine gun. A young man who unabashedly praised murderers and dictators and called for race wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some psychiatrists who believe that \u201cextreme racism\u201d is, in fact, a mental illness. But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["jews", "huffpost", "gun", "white", "tweeted", "teen", "neonazi", "identifies", "disturbing", "mental", "murder", "tied", "nationalist", "twitter", "nicholas", "illness", "heres", "young", "charged"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

Through his social media posts, it was clear to me that Wade was charismatic, unassuming and bright and navigated the world in a very self-assured way. What was also evident was his genuine love for people and for his community. Put simply, Wade was a star who was wise beyond his years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, he also became a victim of gun violence and was taken from us this past Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\nAccording to KPRC Click2Houston, Wade and 29-year-old Mario Jerrell Williams reportedly got into a heated argument. A witness reported seeing Williams leave the bedroom of Wade\u2019s home in Atascocita, Texas, apparently upset. The witness told investigators that Williams wanted to talk to Wade, but Wade had asked him repeatedly to leave, which he finally did, according to the police report.\n\nWilliams returned, and moments later, the witness heard two gunshots and ran out, only to see Wade\u2019s twin brother, Stephen, asking someone to call 911, KPRC reports. Williams later turned himself in to the police and is currently being held at Harris County Jail in Texas on $100,000 bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after his death, many media outlets began framing this killing as a violent lover\u2019s quarrel\u2014a crime of passion, perhaps. I will never forget sitting in criminal law and procedure classes in 2009, as a first-year law student, thinking about the nonsense of certain \u201ccrimes of passion.\u201d\n\nSome crimes of passion are deeply connected to possession, ownership, jealousy and ideas of romanticism. None of that is truly connected to passion, and it certainly isn\u2019t connected to love\u2014not the kind any of us should find to be true, anyway. Society owes it to all people to do a better job of discussing the ways that intimate-partner violence (pdf) affects all communities, but especially ones that are often forgotten, like black queer and transgender populations.\n\nStill, Wade\u2019s close friends make clear that what\u2019s most important is how we\u2014as writers, academics and folks at the margins\u2014frame how he lived, especially when mainstream media may find it more valuable to sensationalize how he died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Wade\u2019s life reminds us of the importance of calling into question love, romance and desire in black queerdom. He reminds us of the critical dialogue we should have on how toxic masculinity and patriarchy become increasingly dangerous when compounded with feelings of unrequited love and attraction. His life and death call to attention the ways in which violence cannot be viewed through a narrow prism when we\u2019re considering the intersections of blackness and queerness.\n\nBut that is not the extent of his legacy. Wade worked fervently so that those without a \u201cbright future\u201d\u2014individuals who often fall between the cracks of mass incarceration, poverty, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia\u2014would not be forgotten.\n\nThat memory should not be erased.\n\n\u201cDevon Wade was a force, an angel amongst men. He was a gentle spirit, who generated electricity in all spaces he dwelled,\u201d said Jeffrey McCune of Washington University in St. Louis, a mentor and friend to Wade. \u201cHis life\u2019s work, examining the impact of incarcerated parents on children, was to be a shape-shifter to the sociology of education. He is sorely missed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade understood firsthand the direct impact that mass incarceration had on young people and families. As he was growing up, both his mother and father were in prison, so he was raised by his grandparents. But from all accounts, instead of blaming his parents, he realized their personal struggles and he decided to tackle oppressive systems\u2014such as the prison-industrial complex\u2014and how they affect black communities.\n\nWhile a student at M.B. Smiley High School, Wade enrolled in No More Victims, a program for young people whose parents are incarcerated. Wade eventually became an honors graduate at Louisiana State University, a Harry S. Truman scholar and then a doctoral student at Columbia in New York City, studying sociology. He talked about these experiences often, how they collectively shaped his work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and how he had to unpack his own trauma.\n\nIn the YouTube clip \u201cWho Is: Devon Tyrone Wade,\u201d Wade noted, \u201cI had not yet necessarily had that conversation with my parents about what their being in prison meant for me. And even though I had in most cases excelled \u2026 there were a whole host of things that impacted me in ways I kept inside.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, not only was Wade able to find his own voice, but he was also able to empower others to find theirs.\n\n\n\nWade\u2019s work was focused on not just what happens when we lock up individuals but also what happens to their families. What happens to those communities? What happens to returning citizens once they are released from prison? Wade wanted to create a society that allowed for the most marginalized to survive and thrive by providing resources and also by understanding how trauma is punished for already at-risk youths.\n\n\u201cWhat we will miss from [Wade] is that he speaks assuredly but not abrasively so. He is inclusive, welcoming, warm and wanted his work to extend beyond nonacademics,\u201d close friend and colleague Adam Smith told The Root. \u201cHe wanted to make sure his work was not just contributing to the research but to the people that needed it the most.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade was a budding scholar, a critical thinker and a person known by everyone to show compassion for marginalized communities. He was taken from us by way of gun violence, despite doing what society told us was \u201cright.\u201d Although we can\u2019t bring Wade back, we must continue passing the torch by uplifting often-forgotten people, the alleged downtrodden, those whom society further pushes into the margins.\n\nWhat happened to Wade shouldn\u2019t have happened.

(She isn\u2019t a white supremacist or anything, but she did say that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts are better than Krispy Kremes, which is kind of Hitler-ish, in my opinion.)\n\nIf there is one thing on which we can all agree, I have always assumed, it\u2019s that as a society, we all think murdering children is\u2014at the very least\u2014not a good look.\n\nApparently, I was wrong.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a baby-murdering white guy walked into a church and opened fire, killing people as young as 17 months old. In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

According to the Daily Breeze, Terrell was in deep with a predominantly black South Los Angeles gang in a community that is more than 95 percent white and Asian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is not suspected of firing the fatal shot that took Holmes\u2019 life; he is believed to be the driver who helped the gunmen get away. Despite this, he does face some serious charges, including some based on allegations that he committed the act to help out his gang. A conviction on these charges could get him anything from 25 years to life.\n\nThat being said, despite the hefty and serious charges, Terrell posted bail by Oct. 19 and was scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 29. In the meantime, he is still living his best life as if nothing happened. A Facebook photograph showed him enjoying a World Series game at Dodger Stadium with his affluent parents, with whom he often enjoys trips to Mexican resorts and the other fine things in life, according to the Breeze.\n\nThe Breeze notes that Terrell\u2019s father, Donald Wayne Terrell, is president of the media consulting firm New & Improved Media in El Segundo, Calif., while his mother is a South Bay interior designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerrell also apparently remains in school, which has created more than a buzz among parents. Nonetheless, Palos Verdes Unified School District Superintendent Don Austin said that officials were aware of the charges this young thug faces, declaring that \u201cvigilance is high.\u201d\n\nHowever, Austin did not confirm Terrell\u2019s status at school, saying only very generally that students have the right to a public education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very clear exclusion criteria that have to occur before a student was not allowed to attend a public school,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor a school suspension of any kind, there has to be a direct nexus to the school itself,\u201d Austin added. \u201cThese allegations have no nexus to our school. The allegations and charges against a student without a nexus to school would not be grounds for exclusion.\u201d\n\nThe charges against this wannabe thug stem from the shooting of Holmes on Oct. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that Holmes and two other friends were confronted by two armed individuals who asked where they were from. One armed thug fired several shots, hitting Holmes, while his friends managed to run away.\n\nThe shooter and an accomplice ran back to a black car that drove away. Holmes was rushed to the hospital but couldn\u2019t be saved.\n\nPolice say that Holmes and his friends were not linked to any gang activity.\n\nTwo other suspects are currently in custody on suspicion of murder; however, both are under 18 and are currently being held in a juvenile facility. Their names have not been disclosed. However, the district attorney\u2019s office is reportedly looking to push to have them tried as adults, according to the Breeze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this w3.cdn.anvato.net embed.\n\nRead more at the Daily Breeze.", "keywords": ["shooting", "man", "white", "connection", "series", "game", "school", "nexus", "holmes", "charges", "murder", "oct", "parents", "thug", "days", "world", "terrell", "spotted"], "polarity": 0.07939299830604178, "subjectivity": 0.4015273856578204},

It seems this is what the Air Force calls it when you choke a woman and fracture a child\u2019s skull: bad conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is a person who had violent tendencies,\u201d Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday in response to a question about how Kelley, who is now dead, was able to obtain a gun. \u201cHow that got through the cracks, I don\u2019t have that information.\u201d\n\nBut come Tuesday, we did have that information: the Air Force did not enter Kelley\u2019s domestic violence conviction into the National Criminal Information Center database, so he was able to purchase an AR-556 rifle\u2014more or less a dupe of an AR-15\u2014from a gun store in San Antonio without incident. It is not a surprise when men like Kelley get through the cracks. Our system of regulating domestic abusers\u2019 access to firearms is all cracks.\n\nStill, there are other things that we know equally well, and which remain true and politically untouched no matter how many times we find ourselves in this same place: It is very easy to get a gun in the United States; and where there are more guns, more women die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost women killed in this country, 55 percent, die in an incident related to intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those women, more than 90 percent, are killed by a current or former intimate partner. Most of those deaths, 54 percent, are gun deaths.\n\nThis happens every day\u2014nearly three times a day, actually. But we generally don\u2019t talk about our dead women until our angry men kill other people\u2014at churches in Texas or baseball fields in Virginia or gay night clubs in Florida or health clinics in Colorado.\n\nWhen we talk about these dead women, or the women who survive domestic violence and function as a set of parallel statistics, it is often as a kind of foreshadowing to violence considered more consequential: mass shootings. The women are canaries in the coal mine, or the grotesque connective tissue that bind these shooters, overwhelmingly white men, to one another. In death, they are minor characters in some other kind of story about some other kind of violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen things quiet down again, we will return to a system that does not maintain comprehensive records on men barred from owning a gun, does not meaningfully enforce the laws that might take their guns away from them, and does not consider all intimate partner violence equally disqualifying. And so more women die. The daily realities of domestic violence fade into white noise until another mass shooting compels us to talk about it again, which is why I know we will be back here soon enough.\n\nFor more news and opinions that get under your skin, follow us on Facebook.", "keywords": ["gun", "kind", "women", "talk", "violence", "men", "warning", "dead", "domestic", "partner", "texas", "signs", "killed"], "polarity": 0.06928462709284627, "subjectivity": 0.40452815829528155}
