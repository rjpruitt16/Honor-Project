It was created by an Act of Congress in 1962 and opened to the public in 1968. (The Obama unveiling is billed as part of its 50th birthday celebrations.) By the time it began collecting, many chief executive portraits of note were already housed elsewhere. (The collection of first lady portraits is still incomplete; commissioning new ones started only in 2006.)\n\nThere are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLandsdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ \u201cIt\u2019s going to be, like, boom!?\u201d Read our interview with the artist Kehinde Wiley. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a beige suit for a black one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["obama", "mrs", "mr", "fact", "sherald", "portrait", "paint", "obamas", "fiction", "wiley", "black", "ms", "politics", "blend", "portraits"], "polarity": 0.07512346068171309, "subjectivity": 0.36038996063267925},

But Republicans have gradually lost advantages of their own.\n\nSlowly but surely, the considerable structural advantages \u2014 like incumbency, geography and gerrymandering \u2014 that give the Republicans a chance to survive a so-called wave election are fading, giving Democrats a clearer path to a House majority in November.\n\nThe Republicans still retain formidable advantages, enough to win the House while losing the popular vote by a wide margin. But their edge has shrunk considerably over the last few months, and even more over the last few years.\n\nOne way to think about it is how well Democrats would need to do on the generic ballot \u2014 a poll question that asks voters whether they\u2019ll vote for Democrats or Republicans for Congress \u2014 to win the House. A bigger Republican structural advantage means the G.O.P. can withstand a larger Democratic advantage on the generic ballot.\n\nBy this measure, the Republican advantage has probably dropped by about two percentage points since 2014, when Republicans won the party\u2019s largest House majority since 1929.\n\nSince then, four court rulings have softened or even torn up Republican gerrymanders in four big states: Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and most recently Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map last month.\n\nThe decisions in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia have already cost the Republicans a net of three House seats while generally eroding their position elsewhere in those states, giving Democrats better opportunities in 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to have a good idea of how much Republicans might lose in Pennsylvania, but it is reasonable to expect that the new map will cost the party at least one seat and erode its position in several others.\n\nGerrymandering is not the only reason Democrats are at a disadvantage. Republicans also have the advantage of incumbency, which, on average, allows members to run about seven percentage points ahead of the national party.\n\nBut Republicans have gradually been losing the advantages of incumbency as well, most obviously because of 34 recent retirements in Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nOver all, the number of G.O.P. retirements in plausibly competitive districts isn\u2019t extraordinarily high. But some of the Republican retirements have been especially damaging: longtime incumbents who have a tradition of running far ahead of the national party and dissuading strong challengers, like New Jersey\u2019s Frank LoBiondo or Pennsylvania\u2019s Charlie Dent. Their retirements could easily be the difference between a non-competitive race and a Democratic victory.\n\nThe Republican incumbency advantage has diminished in another way: Democratic recruitment and fund-raising. A strong Democratic recruit \u2014 like a military veteran or an elected official \u2014 can cut into that advantage, especially with strong fund-raising numbers.\n\nAs measured by biographical indicators like military experience or past elected officials, Democratic recruitment is only somewhat above average at this stage. But much like the Republican retirements, the best Democratic recruits have often been extremely valuable.\n\nOften, Democrats have succeeded in finding their very best candidates in white working-class districts where President Trump fared well in 2016. His strength threatened to move many traditional battlegrounds into the Republican column. The Democratic path to a House majority arguably looked even more difficult after the 2016 presidential than it did before \u2014 even though Democrats picked up seven seats in that election, since so many traditional battleground districts swung hard for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut strong Democratic recruiting in Trump Country has kept many traditional battlegrounds on the list, like Illinois\u2019 12th or Kentucky\u2019s Sixth. The Democrats might have an easier time finding qualified and experienced recruits in white working-class districts in part because Democrats have a track record of winning there, and therefore a deeper bench, even if Mr. Trump won a particular district.\n\nIn contrast, the Democrats don\u2019t have much of a bench at all in many of the well-educated but traditionally Republican districts where Mr. Trump struggled the most. Here it\u2019s the Democratic fund-raising that is most impressive. Last quarter, 134 Democrats in 83 districts raised at least $100,000 in individual contributions. Those successes have been disproportionately concentrated in well-educated areas.\n\nIt\u2019s the working-class districts where Democrats are likeliest to have true recruiting holes, like New York\u2019s 24th or California\u2019s 21st. That might seem somewhat odd because Democrats have had so much success luring top-tier candidates in working-class districts.\n\nIn fact, Democrats do have well-qualified, potential candidates in these districts, like the state assemblyman Rudy Salas or the former Syracuse mayor Stephanie Miner, but many aren\u2019t running. (Mr. Salas hasn\u2019t entered the race in California\u2019s 21, and Ms. Miner has decided not to run in New York\u2019s 24th.) It seems these areas may not be stocked with ambitious, well-to-do and well-connected liberals eager to run when an elected official doesn\u2019t step forward.\n\nEven so, Democrats still seem poised to have viable if imperfect candidates in a large number of battleground districts. Upshot estimates indicate that Democrats would need to win the popular vote by 7.4 points \u2014 albeit with a healthy margin of error of plus or minus more than four points \u2014 to take the House. Today, most estimates put the generic congressional ballot very near that number. So far from the election, the fight for control remains a tossup.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot. He covers elections, polling and demographics.

Scott Walker, another Republican, said the state\u2019s plans for improving failing schools amounted to little more than \u201cbureaucratic paperwork\u201d and \u201cdoes little to challenge the status quo.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the most contentious case, Maryland\u2019s moderate Republican governor, Larry Hogan, is engaged in a bitter battle with the Democrat-controlled Legislature over the state\u2019s education goals, which a spokesman called \u201ca farce.\u201d\n\nAs Maryland was compiling its plan, the Legislature passed a bill to limit strategies championed by the governor that would allow state leaders to implement major changes for persistently low-performing schools. The Legislature was seeking to protect against what lawmakers saw as privatization efforts, such as expanding charter schools and vouchers \u2014 what a teachers union called the \u201cDeVos playbook.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Mr. Hogan wrote that he could not support his own state\u2019s plan given the \u201cimpossible circumstances\u201d that the Legislature had imposed.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s not going to put his name on something that he doesn\u2019t think actually helps students,\u201d said Douglass V. Mayer, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly disgusting.\u201d\n\nWhile governors\u2019 signatures were not required for approval, Congress went to great lengths to identify the state executives as key stakeholders in the next wave of education reform. Not only did they get their own signature box, but governors were mentioned 23 times in the law, which calls for plans to be assembled with \u201ctimely and meaningful consultation with the governor.\u201d\n\nThe bill was the first to be endorsed by the National Governors Association since the welfare overhaul of 1996.

It replaced the top-heavy No Child Left Behind Act from the George W. Bush era. That law had become unpopular because of its emphasis on testing and prescriptive mandates, though it is still widely praised for unmasking the nation\u2019s achievement gaps, particularly for black, poor and special education students.\n\nMs. DeVos has drawn criticism from both parties for her department\u2019s approach to the new law, particularly from its chief architects, Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Ms. Murray has criticized Ms. DeVos as a rubber stamp for plans that fail to execute the law\u2019s intent to hold schools accountable for struggling students, even while Mr. Alexander balked at what he saw as the Education Department\u2019s heavy hand in attempting to enforce the new law.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Maryland, the law has become a political football. The heavily Democratic state has a Republican governor, powerful teachers unions and a high-profile, low-performing school district, Baltimore, that holds the bulk of the state\u2019s charter schools.\n\nCiting the new law\u2019s charge for governors to be involved in education planning, Mr. Hogan submitted to the State Board of Education several suggestions for overhauling schools performing in the bottom 5 percent, such as creating separate school districts, expanding charter schools run by private companies and increasing funding for a state voucher program for private schools.\n\nShortly thereafter, a bill emerged in the Maryland General Assembly, the Protect Our Schools Act, that banned every intervention the governor had suggested. The bill also said academic indicators such as test scores could account for no more than 65 percent of a school\u2019s performance rating, among the lowest percentages proposed in the country.\n\nMr. Hogan vetoed the bill, but the Legislature overrode his veto. Mr. Hogan plans to back legislation seeking to reverse the bill\u2019s provisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Maryland State Education Association, the union that represents most Maryland teachers, was among the major champions of the legislation.

And while the World Bank and a collection of corporations and nongovernmental organizations attending the conference will offer some help, the lack of big-ticket pledges will break what Western governments had long seen as a gentleman\u2019s agreement that the United States and Europe would prosecute and pay for the war, while the Saudis and Emiratis would underwrite the peace.\n\nThe expected failure at the Kuwait conference, while a potential embarrassment for Mr. Tillerson, represents a severe blow to the Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, whose political position remains tenuous despite his orchestration of the Islamic State\u2019s defeat in his country and successful efforts to subdue well-armed Iranian-linked militias. Of the $100 billion that Mr. Abadi was hoping to receive, Iraq was struggling last week to get commitments of even $5 billion, diplomats said.\n\nThe disappointment is an enormous change from last year\u2019s euphoric trip by President Trump to the region, but it follows a pattern faced by almost every American administration of the modern era, as hope for shared solutions to the region\u2019s endemic conflicts inevitably gives way to a more discouraging reality.\n\nThe Trump administration accelerated that process by upending decades of consensus American policy in the Middle East as it recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and slashed support for Palestinian refugees.\n\nThe result is that on his stops in Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, Mr. Tillerson will either be delivering difficult messages \u2014 urging partners to follow through on promises \u2014 or trying to assuage furious allies. And while previous administrations had papered over differences with generous promises of financial aid, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s goody bag will be all but empty.\n\nStill, Mr. Tillerson will face those considerable challenges newly fortified. His standing appears to have risen in the White House after a year in which his tenuous relationship with the president undermined his diplomatic efforts, as senior administration officials predicted his imminent departure and foreign leaders quietly wondered whether he actually spoke for his mercurial boss.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Thursday, Serkan Golge, an American citizen and NASA scientist, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for alleged links to Mr. Gullen, although no proof of such links was offered in court.

Schwartz, a Washington lawyer who worked at the F.D.A. in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nDr. Gottlieb has briefed Mr. Trump several times on agency issues, like opioids and generic drugs. During a dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, President Trump told a group of European business executives, including a few from the pharmaceutical industry, that \u201cScott Gottlieb, as you know, is a star.\u201d\n\nSo far, the commissioner has displayed a collaborative management style, seeming to allay the concerns of some career employees who had balked at his industry ties and were dismayed by articles he had written criticizing the F.D.A. He has overcome some divisions by promoting several agency veterans, but he has also hired a few industry insiders for top positions. He is described by staff as energetic and intense, while holding town hall-style meetings before making decisions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being thoughtful; he\u2019s being deliberative,\u201d said William Hubbard, who retired from the F.D.A. after 30 years, including work as a consultant to a former commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, until she stepped down in 2015. \u201cHe seems to be putting aside some of his more extreme rhetoric from when he was outside, and working through the issues with a public-health orientation.\u201d\n\nAlthough Dr. Gottlieb declined to be interviewed for this article, he is quite chatty online. He issues lengthy statements after nearly every major decision, and banters on Twitter, chiding reporters for eating unsafe Thanksgiving leftovers or laughing along at jokes about his skinny jeans, or his prized backyard chickens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI thought he was a bad pick,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, a co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. \u201cBut I may have been wrong.\u201d\n\nDr. Kolodny singled out the agency\u2019s success last summer in getting Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling an extended-release opioid, Opana ER, citing its concerns that the drug\u2019s benefits no longer outweighed the risk of abuse.\n\nCritical decisions ahead\n\nEven as Dr. Gottlieb makes some progress, there are major unsettled regulatory matters before the agency. They include the extent to which drug companies can market their products for off-label uses as well as how much oversight is needed for the laboratory-developed tests that hospitals and doctors often use to detect conditions ranging from heart disease to ovarian cancer \u2014 a booming business.\n\nAmong the most far-reaching decisions will be the efforts taken to reduce the time for drug companies to develop new drugs.\n\n\u201cThat is where anxiety lies,\u201d said Mr. Hubbard, who added that the key will be ensuring that, in moving new products to market more quickly, public health is not compromised. \u201cThe test will be whether he can do that safely, and we won\u2019t know the results of that for quite some time.\u201d\n\nSome early decisions have drawn criticism, like postponing requirements for food companies to note sugar and other nutritional information on package labels. Another sparked an outcry when Dr. Gottlieb partly reversed his own position, deciding against disclosing the reasons the agency gives drug companies when it turns down products.\n\nHe has taken steps to speed drug and device approvals, and has promised to do more.\n\nDr. Michael Carome, director of the consumer group Public Citizen\u2019s health research arm and a former health department official, opposed Dr. Gottlieb for the job, and has not seen anything to change his mind.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: He\u2019s pursuing a pro-industry deregulatory agenda that ultimately is going to put patients at risk,\u201d Dr. Carome said. \u201cThe F.D.A. now views industry as their customers, and they need to keep them happy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA government past\n\nDr. Gottlieb\u2019s Republican credentials made him a strong candidate for the agency\u2019s top post from the beginning. He had previously worked for both the Department of Health and Human Services and the F.D.A. during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nBut his chances were not clear early last year, after President Trump vowed to slash drug regulations and, in an address to Congress, described the F.D.A.\u2019s approval process as \u201cslow and burdensome.\u201d Other names surfaced, like Jim O\u2019Neill, an associate of the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Mr. O\u2019Neill had suggested that drugs could be approved without first proving they worked and supported the creation of colonies at sea that would be beyond government reach.\n\nThose views made Dr. Gottlieb look mainstream by comparison. So after a hearing that focused on his ties to the drug and device industry, he was confirmed by the Senate, 57 to 42, on May 9.\n\nCritics pointed to Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s stints on advisory boards for pharmaceutical companies, among them GlaxoSmithKline and Daiichi Sankyo, and his consultant work for others, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nHis investments through New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm, and T.R. Winston & Company, an investment bank, were also called into question. Earlier in Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s career, before attending the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, he worked as a health care investment banking analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons.\n\nThat experience, Dr. Gottlieb has said, benefits the F.D.A. because it helps him understand the industry. He has recused himself for two years from matters concerning about 20 companies with which he was associated \u2014 in accordance with the White House ethics pledge. The day he was sworn in, he sold all of his health-related stock, including investments in Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Collective Health and U.S. Renal Care, according to a financial report filed with the Office of Government Ethics. He purchased government bond funds.\n\nLike most of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees, Dr. Gottlieb has also hired industry lawyers and lobbyists whose former clients often have business before the agency. Among them are Jack Kalavritinos, an associate commissioner who had lobbied for the device maker Covidien, now owned by Medtronic, for seven years; Nina Devlin, a senior communications adviser who was the head of global communications at Mylan, makers of the EpiPen; and Rebecca K. Wood, who was a partner in the law firm Sidley Austin and is now the agency\u2019s top lawyer.\n\nAccording to her financial disclosure forms, Ms. Wood did legal work for many of the drug industry\u2019s largest companies and trade groups, including AbbVie, Bayer, St. Jude Medical and the Medical Information Working Group, which favors the expansion of off-label uses for drugs. She also worked for New Enterprise Associates, in which Dr. Gottlieb was a venture partner. An agency spokeswoman said that Ms. Wood has had to recuse herself already from several matters, but declined to detail the issues involved.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA balancing act\n\nBy taking a more conventional approach to the job, Dr. Gottlieb stands out among other presidential appointees, some of whom have aggressively rolled back regulations or are curtailing the scope of their agencies\u2019 powers, as at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.\n\nHe has already disagreed with an administration position, objecting to a plan to move an international food-safety division to the trade office, saying it would hurt the country\u2019s reputation as a food watchdog.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe administration backed down on the trade matter, but Dr. Gottlieb has been forced to compromise on other issues. Last October, he questioned proposals backed by Vice President Mike Pence and others that would give terminally ill patients greater access to experimental treatments. He did make a concession \u2014 promising that the F.D.A. would find a way to make it easier for patients to get some of those treatments, although he noted that the agency already approves 99 percent of such requests. Mr. Trump also recently told Republican lawmakers that Dr. Gottlieb was leading the effort to get legislation passed by Congress.\n\nThat balancing act has also been on display in Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s approach to regulating tobacco. Last July, he sent tobacco stocks into a dive after he vowed to take aggressive steps to render cigarettes nonaddictive by forcing manufacturers to cut nicotine levels.\n\nBut even as he railed against big tobacco, Dr. Gottlieb softened the blow by delaying for several years the deadline for companies to comply with tough new rules on e-cigarettes, cigars and other products.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAt the time, he said smokers needed better and more substitutes to get them off nicotine.\n\nBut whether he can maintain that balance remains to be seen: Last month, an F.D.A. advisory committee rejected a major alternative tobacco product to be considered under the new regulations, saying its manufacturer, Philip Morris International, could not claim it was safer than cigarettes. The product under review was the IQOS, a heated tobacco stick device that the company wanted to market as a healthier alternative to cigarettes.\n\nIf the industry can\u2019t overcome such hurdles for approval or finds the process too cumbersome and expensive \u2014 Philip Morris is spending billions of dollars developing smoking alternatives that would need agency approval \u2014 Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s efforts to straddle the division between public health and commerce could be hobbled.\n\nDespite the panel\u2019s rejection \u2014 the experts questioned the science behind the product \u2014 agency officials were quick to say they would continue reviewing Philip Morris\u2019s studies and would ask for more information.\n\nKenneth Warner, a tobacco control expert and dean emeritus of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said he found it surprising that the F.D.A. was taking such strong steps to rein in the tobacco industry. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat ironic to me that it takes a Republican administration to think about a new regulation like that, that would have a benefit for public health,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongressional Democrats, though, are still smarting from Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for compliance with new e-cigarette rules, which took effect in 2016. The rules called for companies with products already on the market to disclose their contents and to prove their positive impact on public health in order to gain approval.\n\nBefore becoming commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb served on the board of directors of Kure, a retailer that sells e-cigarette products in lounge-like settings. He has since sold his stake in Kure and said he would recuse himself from any decisions involving the company for two years.\n\nTackling anger over drug prices\n\nHigh drug prices \u2014 and what to do about them \u2014 were a frequent topic of the last election, and the Trump administration seems poised to offer some new proposals in its budget.\n\nHere, Dr. Gottlieb has shifted the agency\u2019s position. F.D.A. officials have traditionally said that regulating prices is beyond the agency\u2019s purview. But Dr. Gottlieb has taken steps to encourage more competition for products that have lost patent protection, including shortening an agency backlog for approvals of new generic drugs and publishing a list of off-patent drugs for which there is no alternative.\n\nHe surprised critics by holding up for ridicule brand-name drug companies that had refused to supply would-be rivals with samples of their drugs to deter generic competition.\n\n\u201cEnd the shenanigans,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said at a Federal Trade Commission meeting in November.\n\nThe commissioner\u2019s actions so far are likely to do little to substantially lower prices for most Americans, and they notably do not address the towering prices that brand-name drugmakers set for their products.\n\nStill, Chester Davis Jr., president and chief executive of the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic drug companies, was effusive. \u201cThe commissioner has been very effective in using his bully pulpit to shine a very bright light on anti-competitive practices,\u201d Mr. Davis said.\n\nAnother closely watched decision will be Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s response to the charged question of how broadly drug companies can market products for unapproved uses. The pharmaceutical industry has won some court cases by arguing that companies have a First Amendment right to promote products for conditions that have not been sanctioned by the agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore becoming commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb supported so-called \u201coff label\u201d promotion. He has not yet moved to issue final guidelines, first proposed under the Obama administration, that will let drugmakers discuss unapproved uses with entities like insurance companies.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/upshot/liberals-wanted-fiscal-stimulus-conservatives-delivered-it.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberals Wanted Fiscal Stimulus. Conservatives Delivered It. Left-leaning economists hate the timing and the composition. But the expansionary fiscal policy they sought is on the way. Image President Obama discussed fiscal stimulus in a meeting with governors in 2010. At the time, Republicans were typically more focused on the debt. Credit Luke Sharrett for The New York Times\n\nFor years, many liberal economists have argued that a little more federal spending and a higher budget deficit would create a stronger economy.\n\nNow, they\u2019re getting their wish, or at least a fun-house mirror version of it. All it took was total Republican control of the government.\n\nThe fiscal austerity that drove the budget deficit from around 9 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 to 3 percent in 2016 has, for practical purposes, been abandoned. First, Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill in December that sharply cut rates on businesses. Then last week they made a deal to undo budget caps demanded by the Republican House in 2011. President Trump signed that bill on Friday.\n\nThis sudden reversal has the economists who have long argued we should run the economy a little hot \u2014 that is, stimulate it using the government\u2019s power to tax and spend \u2014 in something of a quandary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird and conflicted feeling,\u201d said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who worked in the Obama White House. \u201cOn some level I should be happy, and I am sort of happy right now, but with some nontrivial caveats.\u201d\n\nHe and others in this boat don\u2019t at all like the composition of this particular easing of fiscal policy. It is focused on tax cuts for businesses, rather than on investment in roads and bridges or worker training. The latter would be the kinds of steps more likely to have long-term payoffs and to benefit working-class Americans, they believe. (A big chunk of the additional spending will go toward the military.)\n\nLiberal skeptics of this new age of anti-austerity also don\u2019t like the timing. Mr. Bernstein, no one\u2019s idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the United States run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. That creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.\n\nBut those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, originally a George W. Bush nominee, spent years imploring Congress to spend more money in the near term to try to boost growth, to little avail.\n\nThe case for a more expansionary fiscal policy varies depending on the individual, but arguments have included:\n\nIt might spur more jobs at higher wages.\n\nCoax people who had dropped out of the labor force to look for work.\n\nFuel higher productivity growth.\n\nMitigate a global shortage of safe government bonds.\n\nHelp break the United States out of a prolonged cycle of sluggish growth and financial booms and busts.\n\nFor example, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, has been a leading advocate of the idea that \u201csecular stagnation\u201d has taken hold. The idea is that the economy is in a self-reinforcing pattern of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates, and that overreliance on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies to try to spur growth has fueled financial bubbles.\n\nTo escape that trap, Mr. Summers urged government to make large-scale investment in infrastructure. That investment, he said, would create jobs for men, a demographic that has disproportionately dropped out of the labor force. And it would improve the long-term economic potential of the United States, taking the pressure off the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies to achieve growth.\n\nHe argues now that the policies that the Trump administration and Congress have reached, while directionally the same as those he advocates, won\u2019t get the job done and carry risks.\n\n\u201cYes, I have favored more expansionary fiscal policy, and this is more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the wrong kind of expansionary fiscal policy, and it\u2019s at the wrong time, at the rare moment when fiscal policy is likely to be almost entirely crowded out.\u201d\n\nExpect to hear that term, \u201ccrowded out,\u201d frequently in the economic debates of the years ahead.\n\nIn mainstream models of how the economy works, it\u2019s the idea that if the government runs budget deficits when the economy is at full employment, its borrowing won\u2019t spur new economic activity as desired. Instead, the borrowing will simply raise interest rates and squeeze out private-sector investment, resulting in no net improvement in the economy.\n\nThe decline in stock markets since Jan. 26, and the rise in Treasury bond yields, suggests investors are becoming wary of that happening in the coming years.\n\nAdvocates of fiscal stimulus during the 2008 recession and the slow recovery argued that crowding out wasn\u2019t a valid fear during that time. Vast economic resources, including workers and machines, were sitting on the sidelines, so the government had room to stimulate without causing a rise in interest rates.\n\nA common refrain \u2014 and the baseline for negotiations between the Obama administration and Republicans in the House \u2014 was that any short-term boost to spending had to be accompanied by longer-term deficit reduction. It was on those terms, for example, that stiff budget cuts known as \u201csequestration\u201d were partly reversed \u2014 with offsets to avoid raising the deficit over the ensuing decade.\n\n\u201cRepublicans were very tough about that,\u201d said Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers until President Trump took office and is now at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. Now, a Republican Congress is agreeing to raise spending beyond those sequestration limits without other cuts to offset the increases. \u201cThis is very frustrating because it feels like one group of people are living by the rules, while another group is not living by the rules of economics or arithmetic.\u201d\n\nThe frustration of facing resistance to more expansionary fiscal policy during a period of high unemployment wasn\u2019t confined to liberals. As Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke urged Congress to pair a higher short-term fiscal boost with long-term deficit reduction.\n\nAs recently as last year, he wrote that \u201cthere is still a case for fiscal policy action today,\u201d but that it should focus on improving the economy\u2019s productive capacity, \u201cfor example, through improved public infrastructure that makes our economy more efficient or tax reforms that promote private capital investment.\u201d\n\nStill, even if it isn\u2019t designed as the stimulus that advocates would prefer, and even if its timing is the direct opposite of what Keynesian economics might recommend, this may be the best test of some of the theories on expansionary fiscal policy that will come along.\n\n\u201cThis is a test of whether we\u2019re at full employment or not,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201c I think by knocking the unemployment rate down even further, we\u2019re going to get more real economic activity, not just more inflation. But now we\u2019re going to find out if I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

Gen. Mark Martins, the lead prosecutor, this past week to provide information about the basis for Mr. Rishikof\u2019s firing as a matter of so-called discovery, the process by which the government must turn over to the defense relevant information in its possession.\n\n\u201cThe firing fairly raises the question of whether it constituted unlawful influence on the convening authority, and we have an obligation to try to learn everything we can about that,\u201d Mr. Nevin said.\n\nGuilty pleas would offer a way out of a complex case that has been mired in years of pretrial hearings and is certain to face many more years of appeals if it ever gets to trial and results in convictions. Taxpayers have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars pursuing the case, and plea deals would bring earlier closure to victims\u2019 families.\n\nBut striking such a deal would mean giving up on winning death sentences against defendants accused of aiding the murder of nearly 3,000 people, and could amount to surrender over the idea of using military commissions to prosecute terrorism cases.\n\nMr. Rishikof was removed by Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, and Mr. Brown was removed by William S. Castle, the acting general counsel of the Pentagon, according to a statement issued on Monday by Tom Crosson, a spokesman for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n\nMr. Crosson did not respond on Saturday to an email asking whether the firings were connected to any disagreement over whether the Sept. 11 case should be settled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe firings came less than a week after President Trump announced in his State of the Union speech his intention to make greater use of Guant\u00e1namo, despite having sent no new detainees there in his first year in office, and signed an executive order directing Mr. Mattis to come up with a new policy for handling future terrorism captives.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast year, both Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who have been outspoken supporters of using Guant\u00e1namo in general, publicly disparaged the tribunals system as too slow. The system\u2019s larger problems, however, were not the doing of Mr. Rishikof and Mr. Brown, who were appointed to their roles last spring.\n\nLate last year, Mr. Rishikof\u2019s office rejected potential charges against three detainees in connection with the 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, after prosecutors put forward the idea of starting a new case. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Brown had sent the so-called charging package back to prosecutors because it was missing a required element, so it never reached Mr. Rishikof for a policy decision.\n\nCmdr.

The Trump administration has shuttered the State Department office that negotiated detainee transfers.\n\nMr. Rishikof appears to have been pursuing separate discussions with different legal teams in the Sept. 11 case at various stages of development.\n\nJames Connell, a lawyer for another Sept. 11 defendant, Ammar al-Baluchi, said that the last concrete step in his settlement discussions with Mr. Rishikof was a meeting last fall, but that the question of Mr. Darbi\u2019s fate had slowed the talks.\n\n\u201cI said I could not seriously consider negotiating,\u201d Mr. Connell wrote in a text message, unless he knew whether Mr. Rishikof \u201ccould make an enforceable deal. I said we would talk again after Darbi transfer.\u201d\n\nThe Sept. 11 case defendants offered to plead guilty in late 2008, but the Obama administration then took office and shut down the commissions. It later decided to overhaul the system and keep it, but wanted to move the Sept. 11 case to civilian court. After Congress blocked that option, the Sept. 11 defendants were re-arraigned before a Guant\u00e1namo tribunal in 2012 \u2014 and pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYears of pretrial hearings and delays ensued. Last year, prosecutors completed providing the defense with the evidence the government believes it is entitled to see. But, in an illustration of the continuing complexities that settling the case would sidestep, defense lawyers are insisting that they must have a freer hand to try to learn more about the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s former \u201cblack site\u201d prisons, where their clients were tortured.\n\nThe strategy of defense lawyers is to focus on that torture as mitigation against potential death sentences and to seek suppression of statements their clients made to the F.B.I. shortly after the C.I.A. sent them to Guant\u00e1namo in 2007.\n\nThe evidence the government has turned over about that program includes summaries about what agency employees and contractors who served as guards, doctors and interrogators at the prisons saw and did. Most are described by codes, because the C.I.A. is determined to keep their identities secret.\n\nAfter providing those summaries, the prosecution told defense lawyers that they are not allowed to directly approach people they believe might be such witnesses or to travel to countries they believe might have hosted prisons to ask questions. Rather, the defense must go through the government to request interviews, they said \u2014 hinting that defense lawyers could be prosecuted for spilling classified secrets if they disobey.\n\nBut Mr. Connell said defense lawyers had an ethical obligation to independently seek additional details that might persuade members of the jurylike commission to spare their clients\u2019 lives \u2014 suggesting that the rival imperatives are creating an irreconcilable conflict.\n\nThe issue \u201csort of blew up out of nowhere, but in another way, it is a long time coming,\u201d Mr. Connell told the judge at a hearing last month.", "keywords": ["911", "sent", "guant\u00e1namo", "11", "mr", "suspects", "official", "lawyers", "exploring", "deals", "pentagon", "rishikof", "plea", "defense", "sept", "fired", "case", "trump", "office"], "polarity": 0.0487542839105339, "subjectivity": 0.413441332972583},

Administration officials maintained that they acted decisively in each case.\n\nBut it was in keeping with the White House\u2019s initially defensive reaction to the charges against Mr. Porter \u2014 a messy trail of conflicting statements that has left the West Wing in turmoil, with angry officials pointing fingers at one another.\n\nThe White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, staunchly defended Mr. Porter initially. Ms. Sanders said the president had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in his performance, while Mr. Kelly described him as \u201ca man of true integrity and honor.\u201d\n\nYet the allegations against Mr. Porter and Mr. Sorensen were longstanding, well documented, and at least in Mr. Porter\u2019s case, known to the White House for months, even as he held one of the West Wing\u2019s most sensitive positions, channeling paperwork to the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives, Jennifer Willoughby, obtained a restraining order against him, while the other, Colbie Holderness, presented a photograph of herself with a black eye, which she said came from being hit by Mr. Porter while the couple was on vacation in Italy.\n\nThe F.B.I. informed the White House of these charges, which held up Mr. Porter\u2019s application for a permanent security clearance. Mr. Kelly has told his staff he ordered Mr. Porter to be fired 40 minutes after learning of the charges, an assertion that other officials disputed.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Sorensen, his former wife, Jessica Corbett, told F.B.I. agents conducting a background check on her husband that he had run over her foot while driving a car and extinguished a cigarette on her hand during a turbulent two-and-a-half-year marriage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lieu, a Democrat from California, said on Twitter. \u201cVictims deserve due process as well.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has a history of coming to the defense of accused men. In addition to Mr. Moore and Mr. O\u2019Reilly, he defended Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, who resigned amid multiple allegations of misconduct; Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who was charged with battery after grabbing the arm of a female reporter; and Mike Tyson, the boxer who went to jail for raping an 18-year-old beauty queen.\n\nFrequently, Mr. Trump notes that the charges are old, that they might not be true and that the accused has denied them.\n\n\u201cForty years is a long time,\u201d he said of allegations that Mr. Moore had molested girls as young as 14. \u201cHe\u2019s run eight races, and this has never came up.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Mr. Lewandowski, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s a fine person, he\u2019s a very good person. And I don\u2019t want to destroy a man. If you let him go, you would destroy a man, destroy a family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDozens of women have accused Mr. Trump himself of sexual harassment during his years as a real estate developer, reality-TV star and beauty pageant owner. He has consistently denied the charges, often in terms not unlike those he uses in defending other men.\n\n\u201cA lot of things get made up over the years,\u201d he said in 2016, responding to an investigation by The New York Times that detailed what multiple women described as lewd comments and unwelcome advances. \u201cI have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call for due process does reflect a fear shared by others that the #MeToo movement has gained so much momentum that in some cases, men accused of misconduct are being judged too quickly or punished too severely for sexual behavior that falls into a gray area.\n\nYet Mr. Trump has been quick to judge in other instances. In the 1989 case of the Central Park jogger, Mr. Trump bought a full-page ad in newspapers calling for the five suspects to be given the death penalty. Even after the convictions against the men were dropped 13 years later, Mr. Trump insisted they were guilty.\n\n\u201cYou falsely alleged rape by the #CentralParkFive even AFTER they were exonerated, but said nothing about due process for 5 black boys,\u201d Cornell William Brooks, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in a tweet. \u201cFor 2 white men accused of wife beating, you argue due process. Due process applies to more than @WhiteHouse staff or white men.\u201d\n\nTo some critics, Mr. Trump\u2019s defensive tone on Saturday was less a setback for the #MeToo movement than evidence of its success \u2014 a political and social tidal wave crashing on the doorstep of the White House.\n\n\u201cTrump is now tweeting to legitimize domestic violence,\u201d said Amy Siskind, who publishes a weekly list on the web of how Mr. Trump is changing the country. \u201cLike months ago when he defended a pedophile.

At 17, she was accepted to Harvard University, where she planned to study medicine.\n\nBut her mother died of breast cancer three weeks before school started. \u201cI failed a bunch of classes,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cI was just depressed.\u201d She took a year off, returned to Brooklyn \u2014 staying with an aunt and working a temp job at Columbia Pictures \u2014 and then switched her major to documentary filmmaking.\n\n\u201cI was thinking Hollywood movies,\u201d she said. \u201cCome to find out Harvard doesn\u2019t do that. So I had to study documentary.\u201d\n\nMs. Reid had also always been captivated by politics. In the late 1990s she moved to Miami to write for a local television morning show. There, she became a fixture among South Florida lawmakers. She was involved in minority outreach for voter education and blogged. In 2005 she met James Thomas, a longtime disc jockey and radio veteran known as James T, who hired her to produce a talk radio show for listeners in the black community.\n\n\u201cI had to convince her of the power we had in radio in Miami,\u201d Mr. Thomas said in an interview. \u201cWe were going to go to places people didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d This included Opa-locka, a town marred by gang violence and political corruption whose residents she interviewed. \u201cWe had Lou Dobbs on and Marco Rubio,\u201d Mr. Thomas said, laughing, referring to the conservative Fox Business Network host and the Republican Florida senator. \u201cShe loved to debate.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Ms. Reid was named managing editor of theGrio.com, a news and analysis website aimed at an African-American audience. (By then she was also writing op-ed columns for The Miami Herald and appearing as a commentator on cable news.) Chris Witherspoon, now a correspondent for the movie ticket seller Fandango.com, was rewriting news briefs for the site when she arrived. \u201cJoy said, \u2018You are way too fabulous to be behind your desk,\u2019\u201d he recalled. She promoted him to entertainment editor.\n\nWhen the singer Whitney Houston died in 2012, MSNBC called Ms. Reid to speak about it on camera, Mr. Witherspoon said. \u201cJoy said, \u2018I think you should do it,\u2019\u201d he recalled. He did so for a week and went on to appear on other talk and news shows. Ms. Reid, he said, \u201cgave me my voice when I didn\u2019t have one of my own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite a hectic schedule, Ms. Reid makes time for an extended family. \u201cShe is very girlfriend-y,\u201d said Jacque Reid, a television personality who is not related to Joy but has been close with her for a long time. She remembered a party her friend, who lives in Brooklyn, had in December. There were some celebrities, sure. \u201cShe also had the women who helped raise her, her cousins and their children. Those are the V.I.P.s in her life.\u201d\n\nMs. Reid got her television break in 2014 when she was hired by MSNBC to create a daily show called \u201cThe Reid Report.\u201d It was short-lived, though, canceled the next year because of poor ratings (along with Ronan Farrow\u2019s). \u201cIt was stressful because it was daily,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cThere was a lot more management eyes on us. And when it ended, you know, it was not fun. But it did enable me to do something I hadn\u2019t done in my career, which was to actually be a field reporter.\u201d\n\nMany of her stories focused on race in America. In 2015, she went to Mississippi to investigate the death of a man found hanging from a tree, suspended by a bedsheet, which some people said could have been a lynching. \u201cI literally have never had an experience where I felt almost like I was waking through a haunting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could just feel the ghosts of Mississippi past everywhere you went.\u201d\n\nA few months later, Ms. Reid investigated why black churches were being burned down in Southern states, visiting a church in South Carolina that was across the street from a dark forest. \u201cYou could almost transport yourself back to the 19th century and see the enslaved people running, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cEverything about it had this omnipresent sort of pallor that I think America doesn\u2019t want to deal with.\u201d\n\nShe traveled to 10 states in eight months. \u201cI think it was good for her,\u201d said Phil Griffin, president of MSNBC. \u201cI tried to explain that to her.

At the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland she said she watched men walking up and down the street with semiautomatic rifles \u201cbecause they wanted us to know they had guns\u201d (\u201cus\u201d meaning the media). She recalled a white woman on the elevator praising Mr. Trump for his anti-immigration stance.\n\n\u201cI should have known then that Trump would win,\u201d Ms. Reid said.\n\nPhoto\n\nA week after she sparred on air with Pastor Burns, Ms. Reid focused on another topic: the national Women\u2019s March. Four screens in the studio showed live feeds from Denver, Washington, New York and Chicago, where women (and some men) poured into city streets, most protesting the policies of Mr. Trump. Ms. Reid\u2019s talk show panel was made up of women that reflected conservative, minority and liberal viewpoints.\n\nIn her class for Syracuse, which she teaches in Manhattan, Ms. Reid addresses the precarious definition of what the president calls \u201cfake news,\u201d and why it is a dangerous concept. \u201cNow, something is \u2018true\u2019 because you like it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the information is displeasing to you or makes you uncomfortable, or is in opposition to your ideology, then it is \u2018fake.\u2019\u201d She is concerned consumers of news will isolate themselves, believing only what makes them feel good. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor her, Twitter is a tool to combat critics. Of Mr. Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, she tweeted that his goal appeared to normalize his presidency by using church, family and the military as \u201cthe tropes of 1950s-era nationalism.\u201d The president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. weighed in, saying his father embraced values hated by liberals.

Mr. French shot back that she had misconstrued his comments. Ms. Reid had not read his article, but a summary from another news outlet. She apologized.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s human,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all are guilty of skimming the articles or reading the headlines.\u201d\n\nIn December, she was widely criticized for decade-old blog posts that mocked former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. In the mid-2000s, she wrote that he was a closeted gay man whose marriage to a woman gave him political cover. She apologized to him and others she may have disappointed. Mr. Crist accepted her apology, on \u2014 where else \u2014 Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that I actually really like Charlie Crist,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a lovely guy.\u201d But in today\u2019s polarized political climate, everything is fodder for critics and opponents.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t just want to disagree with the people they disagree with,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cThey want to destroy them.\u201d\n\nIn the summer, Ms. Reid came across a quote from Octavia Butler, an American fiction writer whose novel \u201cParable of the Talents\u201d explored religious intolerance. To sum it up, Ms. Butler warned people to choose their leaders carefully. Ms. Reid pinned the quote to her Twitter account as a reminder to call out hypocrisy when she sees it in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cI think people should think more deeply about what they\u2019re electing, about who they\u2019re electing,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause that person becomes the embodiment of America.\u201d", "keywords": ["reid", "mr", "wrote", "think", "joy", "ms", "reading", "resistance", "msnbc", "heroine", "york", "trump"], "polarity": 0.0726597240627853, "subjectivity": 0.36864011838501626},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/climate/trump-infrastructure-climate-change.html", "text": "A White House spokeswoman, who asked to remain anonymous because the plan was not yet public, declined to discuss whether climate change reports were considered in the preparation of Mr. Trump\u2019s blueprint. \u201cThe president\u2019s team spent almost a full year formulating his infrastructure plan and all relevant scientific data was considered,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.\n\nSince the beginning of his administration, Mr. Trump and his appointees have steadily worked to roll back climate change regulations. Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. chief, Scott Pruitt, has taken the lead role in the administration\u2019s efforts to undo climate policies and question the validity of climate science. On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt suggested that global warming could benefit humanity.\n\nThose views are contradicted by research conducted by his own agency.\n\nThe 2017 E.P.A. report warned that some 6,000 bridges nationwide face a greater risk of damage in coming decades from the effects of a warming climate. It provides analysis showing that \u201cproactive adaptation\u201d \u2014 essentially, planning for global warming before you build \u2014 could save the government up to 70 percent in future costs of repairing damage caused by climate change-driven weather events such as deluges, coastal flooding and heat waves.\n\nPhoto\n\nA spokeswoman for the E.P.A. did not respond to requests to interview the study\u2019s lead scientist, Jeremy Martinich. An academic colleague of Mr. Martinich\u2019s, who has worked with him on several climate reports, including the E.P.A. study published last year, described in practical terms what the findings mean for federal infrastructure planners.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re going to build a new road in Denver that\u2019s designed to last for 25 years,\u201d said the colleague, Paul Chinowsky, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \u201cWhat climate science tells us is that, over the next 25 years, the climate in Denver is going to look more like the climate in Albuquerque\u201d \u2014 meaning, he said, that the asphalt will have to be designed to withstand much higher levels of heat than a Denver road might historically have experienced.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, \u201cIt could double the cost of maintenance and the amount of delays on that road.\u201d\n\nIn New England and the Upper Midwest, Mr. Chinowsky said, failing to account for climate change when planning the asphalt mix for roads there could mean that more rapid cycles of winter freezes and thaws could cause more potholes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you think places like Wisconsin, Minnesota and New England have potholes now, just wait,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chinowsky also pointed to a 2015 study he helped write that focused on the Southeast, in particular an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 85 between Atlanta and Alabama. Over the next 50 years, stronger rainstorms were estimated to cause up to $118 million in damage to the highway and surrounding feeder roads, the study found.\n\nOther scientific and engineering studies make the case that rising sea levels will erode coastal highways in Florida, stronger rains will send rivers flooding bridges in Iowa and more powerful heat waves will melt asphalt across the Southwest.\n\nFor instance, the 2014 National Climate Assessment concluded climate changes will disrupt the reliability and capacity of the nation\u2019s transportation systems, including an increase in flooding of airports, harbors and tunnels. It found that runways in 13 of the nation\u2019s largest airports are vulnerable to flooding from higher storm surges driven by climate change.

Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["obama", "mrs", "mr", "fact", "sherald", "portrait", "paint", "obamas", "fiction", "wiley", "black", "ms", "politics", "blend", "portraits"], "polarity": 0.07512346068171309, "subjectivity": 0.36038996063267925},

But Republicans have gradually lost advantages of their own.\n\nSlowly but surely, the considerable structural advantages \u2014 like incumbency, geography and gerrymandering \u2014 that give the Republicans a chance to survive a so-called wave election are fading, giving Democrats a clearer path to a House majority in November.\n\nThe Republicans still retain formidable advantages, enough to win the House while losing the popular vote by a wide margin. But their edge has shrunk considerably over the last few months, and even more over the last few years.\n\nOne way to think about it is how well Democrats would need to do on the generic ballot \u2014 a poll question that asks voters whether they\u2019ll vote for Democrats or Republicans for Congress \u2014 to win the House. A bigger Republican structural advantage means the G.O.P. can withstand a larger Democratic advantage on the generic ballot.\n\nBy this measure, the Republican advantage has probably dropped by about two percentage points since 2014, when Republicans won the party\u2019s largest House majority since 1929.\n\nSince then, four court rulings have softened or even torn up Republican gerrymanders in four big states: Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and most recently Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map last month.\n\nThe decisions in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia have already cost the Republicans a net of three House seats while generally eroding their position elsewhere in those states, giving Democrats better opportunities in 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to have a good idea of how much Republicans might lose in Pennsylvania, but it is reasonable to expect that the new map will cost the party at least one seat and erode its position in several others.\n\nGerrymandering is not the only reason Democrats are at a disadvantage. Republicans also have the advantage of incumbency, which, on average, allows members to run about seven percentage points ahead of the national party.\n\nBut Republicans have gradually been losing the advantages of incumbency as well, most obviously because of 34 recent retirements in Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nOver all, the number of G.O.P. retirements in plausibly competitive districts isn\u2019t extraordinarily high. But some of the Republican retirements have been especially damaging: longtime incumbents who have a tradition of running far ahead of the national party and dissuading strong challengers, like New Jersey\u2019s Frank LoBiondo or Pennsylvania\u2019s Charlie Dent. Their retirements could easily be the difference between a non-competitive race and a Democratic victory.\n\nThe Republican incumbency advantage has diminished in another way: Democratic recruitment and fund-raising. A strong Democratic recruit \u2014 like a military veteran or an elected official \u2014 can cut into that advantage, especially with strong fund-raising numbers.\n\nAs measured by biographical indicators like military experience or past elected officials, Democratic recruitment is only somewhat above average at this stage. But much like the Republican retirements, the best Democratic recruits have often been extremely valuable.\n\nOften, Democrats have succeeded in finding their very best candidates in white working-class districts where President Trump fared well in 2016. His strength threatened to move many traditional battlegrounds into the Republican column. The Democratic path to a House majority arguably looked even more difficult after the 2016 presidential than it did before \u2014 even though Democrats picked up seven seats in that election, since so many traditional battleground districts swung hard for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut strong Democratic recruiting in Trump Country has kept many traditional battlegrounds on the list, like Illinois\u2019 12th or Kentucky\u2019s Sixth. The Democrats might have an easier time finding qualified and experienced recruits in white working-class districts in part because Democrats have a track record of winning there, and therefore a deeper bench, even if Mr. Trump won a particular district.\n\nIn contrast, the Democrats don\u2019t have much of a bench at all in many of the well-educated but traditionally Republican districts where Mr. Trump struggled the most. Here it\u2019s the Democratic fund-raising that is most impressive. Last quarter, 134 Democrats in 83 districts raised at least $100,000 in individual contributions. Those successes have been disproportionately concentrated in well-educated areas.\n\nIt\u2019s the working-class districts where Democrats are likeliest to have true recruiting holes, like New York\u2019s 24th or California\u2019s 21st. That might seem somewhat odd because Democrats have had so much success luring top-tier candidates in working-class districts.\n\nIn fact, Democrats do have well-qualified, potential candidates in these districts, like the state assemblyman Rudy Salas or the former Syracuse mayor Stephanie Miner, but many aren\u2019t running. (Mr. Salas hasn\u2019t entered the race in California\u2019s 21, and Ms. Miner has decided not to run in New York\u2019s 24th.) It seems these areas may not be stocked with ambitious, well-to-do and well-connected liberals eager to run when an elected official doesn\u2019t step forward.\n\nEven so, Democrats still seem poised to have viable if imperfect candidates in a large number of battleground districts. Upshot estimates indicate that Democrats would need to win the popular vote by 7.4 points \u2014 albeit with a healthy margin of error of plus or minus more than four points \u2014 to take the House. Today, most estimates put the generic congressional ballot very near that number. So far from the election, the fight for control remains a tossup.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot. He covers elections, polling and demographics.

Scott Walker, another Republican, said the state\u2019s plans for improving failing schools amounted to little more than \u201cbureaucratic paperwork\u201d and \u201cdoes little to challenge the status quo.\u201d\n\nIn perhaps the most contentious case, Maryland\u2019s moderate Republican governor, Larry Hogan, is engaged in a bitter battle with the Democrat-controlled Legislature over the state\u2019s education goals, which a spokesman called \u201ca farce.\u201d\n\nAs Maryland was compiling its plan, the Legislature passed a bill to limit strategies championed by the governor that would allow state leaders to implement major changes for persistently low-performing schools. The Legislature was seeking to protect against what lawmakers saw as privatization efforts, such as expanding charter schools and vouchers \u2014 what a teachers union called the \u201cDeVos playbook.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a letter to Ms. DeVos, Mr. Hogan wrote that he could not support his own state\u2019s plan given the \u201cimpossible circumstances\u201d that the Legislature had imposed.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s not going to put his name on something that he doesn\u2019t think actually helps students,\u201d said Douglass V. Mayer, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly disgusting.\u201d\n\nWhile governors\u2019 signatures were not required for approval, Congress went to great lengths to identify the state executives as key stakeholders in the next wave of education reform. Not only did they get their own signature box, but governors were mentioned 23 times in the law, which calls for plans to be assembled with \u201ctimely and meaningful consultation with the governor.\u201d\n\nThe bill was the first to be endorsed by the National Governors Association since the welfare overhaul of 1996. The organization, which has helped governors navigate their new role in the law, said the small group of governors who withheld their signatures illustrates the larger tension around the transfer back to local control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a fundamental shift that it\u2019s actually going as well as it can,\u201d said Anna Davis, the director of government relations at the National Governors Association. \u201cGovernors feel now more accountable. It\u2019s an exciting time.\u201d\n\nFederal Education Department officials said the governors\u2019 protests did not factor into the decisions about whether to approve state plans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It replaced the top-heavy No Child Left Behind Act from the George W. Bush era. That law had become unpopular because of its emphasis on testing and prescriptive mandates, though it is still widely praised for unmasking the nation\u2019s achievement gaps, particularly for black, poor and special education students.\n\nMs. DeVos has drawn criticism from both parties for her department\u2019s approach to the new law, particularly from its chief architects, Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Ms. Murray has criticized Ms. DeVos as a rubber stamp for plans that fail to execute the law\u2019s intent to hold schools accountable for struggling students, even while Mr. Alexander balked at what he saw as the Education Department\u2019s heavy hand in attempting to enforce the new law.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Maryland, the law has become a political football. The heavily Democratic state has a Republican governor, powerful teachers unions and a high-profile, low-performing school district, Baltimore, that holds the bulk of the state\u2019s charter schools.\n\nCiting the new law\u2019s charge for governors to be involved in education planning, Mr. Hogan submitted to the State Board of Education several suggestions for overhauling schools performing in the bottom 5 percent, such as creating separate school districts, expanding charter schools run by private companies and increasing funding for a state voucher program for private schools.\n\nShortly thereafter, a bill emerged in the Maryland General Assembly, the Protect Our Schools Act, that banned every intervention the governor had suggested. The bill also said academic indicators such as test scores could account for no more than 65 percent of a school\u2019s performance rating, among the lowest percentages proposed in the country.\n\nMr. Hogan vetoed the bill, but the Legislature overrode his veto. Mr. Hogan plans to back legislation seeking to reverse the bill\u2019s provisions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Maryland State Education Association, the union that represents most Maryland teachers, was among the major champions of the legislation. Union officials praise the state\u2019s plan as a step in the right direction and away from the \u201ctest-and-punish\u201d culture of No Child Left Behind. Limiting the weight of academic standards reflects the reality that there is more than one way to gauge the success of a school, they said.\n\nCheryl Bost, the vice president of the state union, said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the governor chose not to sign the state plan.\n\n\u201cIt also signals he has prioritized vouchers, takeover districts, for-profit charters over the value of public education in Maryland,\u201d she said.\n\nThe state school board, which includes several appointees of the governor, echoed Mr. Hogan\u2019s concerns about the legislation, which, the board wrote, \u201cdramatically de-prioritizes student achievement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable why the governor didn\u2019t sign off,\u201d said Andy Smarick, the president of the board. \u201cIf anything, his action helps keep alive the serious debate about how best to serve kids.\u201d\n\nWhile the state plan does call for identifying consistently low-performing schools for \u201ctargeted support,\u201d such as staffing changes and resource reallocation, it is scant on details for what happens if a school fails to improve after a number of years.

Of the $100 billion that Mr. Abadi was hoping to receive, Iraq was struggling last week to get commitments of even $5 billion, diplomats said.\n\nThe disappointment is an enormous change from last year\u2019s euphoric trip by President Trump to the region, but it follows a pattern faced by almost every American administration of the modern era, as hope for shared solutions to the region\u2019s endemic conflicts inevitably gives way to a more discouraging reality.\n\nThe Trump administration accelerated that process by upending decades of consensus American policy in the Middle East as it recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and slashed support for Palestinian refugees.\n\nThe result is that on his stops in Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, Mr. Tillerson will either be delivering difficult messages \u2014 urging partners to follow through on promises \u2014 or trying to assuage furious allies. And while previous administrations had papered over differences with generous promises of financial aid, Mr. Tillerson\u2019s goody bag will be all but empty.\n\nStill, Mr. Tillerson will face those considerable challenges newly fortified. His standing appears to have risen in the White House after a year in which his tenuous relationship with the president undermined his diplomatic efforts, as senior administration officials predicted his imminent departure and foreign leaders quietly wondered whether he actually spoke for his mercurial boss.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s creeping authoritarianism, his security detail\u2019s attack in Washington on peaceful protesters, his saber-rattling on Syria and Turkey\u2019s arrests of American citizens and State Department employees have left the relationship severely strained.\n\nFor the Turks, fury at the administration\u2019s refusal to begin the process of extraditing the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey says orchestrated a 2016 coup from his self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, compounds the anger at American support for Kurdish forces. On Thursday, Serkan Golge, an American citizen and NASA scientist, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison for alleged links to Mr. Gullen, although no proof of such links was offered in court.

During a dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, President Trump told a group of European business executives, including a few from the pharmaceutical industry, that \u201cScott Gottlieb, as you know, is a star.\u201d\n\nSo far, the commissioner has displayed a collaborative management style, seeming to allay the concerns of some career employees who had balked at his industry ties and were dismayed by articles he had written criticizing the F.D.A. He has overcome some divisions by promoting several agency veterans, but he has also hired a few industry insiders for top positions. He is described by staff as energetic and intense, while holding town hall-style meetings before making decisions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being thoughtful; he\u2019s being deliberative,\u201d said William Hubbard, who retired from the F.D.A. after 30 years, including work as a consultant to a former commissioner, Dr. Margaret A.

He issues lengthy statements after nearly every major decision, and banters on Twitter, chiding reporters for eating unsafe Thanksgiving leftovers or laughing along at jokes about his skinny jeans, or his prized backyard chickens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI thought he was a bad pick,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, a co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University. \u201cBut I may have been wrong.\u201d\n\nDr. Kolodny singled out the agency\u2019s success last summer in getting Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling an extended-release opioid, Opana ER, citing its concerns that the drug\u2019s benefits no longer outweighed the risk of abuse.\n\nCritical decisions ahead\n\nEven as Dr. Gottlieb makes some progress, there are major unsettled regulatory matters before the agency. They include the extent to which drug companies can market their products for off-label uses as well as how much oversight is needed for the laboratory-developed tests that hospitals and doctors often use to detect conditions ranging from heart disease to ovarian cancer \u2014 a booming business.\n\nAmong the most far-reaching decisions will be the efforts taken to reduce the time for drug companies to develop new drugs.\n\n\u201cThat is where anxiety lies,\u201d said Mr. Hubbard, who added that the key will be ensuring that, in moving new products to market more quickly, public health is not compromised. \u201cThe test will be whether he can do that safely, and we won\u2019t know the results of that for quite some time.\u201d\n\nSome early decisions have drawn criticism, like postponing requirements for food companies to note sugar and other nutritional information on package labels. Another sparked an outcry when Dr. Gottlieb partly reversed his own position, deciding against disclosing the reasons the agency gives drug companies when it turns down products.\n\nHe has taken steps to speed drug and device approvals, and has promised to do more.\n\nDr. Michael Carome, director of the consumer group Public Citizen\u2019s health research arm and a former health department official, opposed Dr. Gottlieb for the job, and has not seen anything to change his mind.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: He\u2019s pursuing a pro-industry deregulatory agenda that ultimately is going to put patients at risk,\u201d Dr. Carome said. \u201cThe F.D.A. now views industry as their customers, and they need to keep them happy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA government past\n\nDr. Gottlieb\u2019s Republican credentials made him a strong candidate for the agency\u2019s top post from the beginning. He had previously worked for both the Department of Health and Human Services and the F.D.A. during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nBut his chances were not clear early last year, after President Trump vowed to slash drug regulations and, in an address to Congress, described the F.D.A.\u2019s approval process as \u201cslow and burdensome.\u201d Other names surfaced, like Jim O\u2019Neill, an associate of the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Mr. O\u2019Neill had suggested that drugs could be approved without first proving they worked and supported the creation of colonies at sea that would be beyond government reach.\n\nThose views made Dr. Gottlieb look mainstream by comparison. So after a hearing that focused on his ties to the drug and device industry, he was confirmed by the Senate, 57 to 42, on May 9.\n\nCritics pointed to Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s stints on advisory boards for pharmaceutical companies, among them GlaxoSmithKline and Daiichi Sankyo, and his consultant work for others, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nHis investments through New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm, and T.R. Winston & Company, an investment bank, were also called into question. Earlier in Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s career, before attending the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, he worked as a health care investment banking analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons.\n\nThat experience, Dr. Gottlieb has said, benefits the F.D.A. because it helps him understand the industry. He has recused himself for two years from matters concerning about 20 companies with which he was associated \u2014 in accordance with the White House ethics pledge. The day he was sworn in, he sold all of his health-related stock, including investments in Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Collective Health and U.S. Renal Care, according to a financial report filed with the Office of Government Ethics. He purchased government bond funds.\n\nLike most of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees, Dr. Gottlieb has also hired industry lawyers and lobbyists whose former clients often have business before the agency. Among them are Jack Kalavritinos, an associate commissioner who had lobbied for the device maker Covidien, now owned by Medtronic, for seven years; Nina Devlin, a senior communications adviser who was the head of global communications at Mylan, makers of the EpiPen; and Rebecca K. Wood, who was a partner in the law firm Sidley Austin and is now the agency\u2019s top lawyer.\n\nAccording to her financial disclosure forms, Ms. Wood did legal work for many of the drug industry\u2019s largest companies and trade groups, including AbbVie, Bayer, St. Jude Medical and the Medical Information Working Group, which favors the expansion of off-label uses for drugs. She also worked for New Enterprise Associates, in which Dr. Gottlieb was a venture partner. An agency spokeswoman said that Ms. Wood has had to recuse herself already from several matters, but declined to detail the issues involved.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA balancing act\n\nBy taking a more conventional approach to the job, Dr. Gottlieb stands out among other presidential appointees, some of whom have aggressively rolled back regulations or are curtailing the scope of their agencies\u2019 powers, as at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy.\n\nHe has already disagreed with an administration position, objecting to a plan to move an international food-safety division to the trade office, saying it would hurt the country\u2019s reputation as a food watchdog.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe administration backed down on the trade matter, but Dr. Gottlieb has been forced to compromise on other issues. Last October, he questioned proposals backed by Vice President Mike Pence and others that would give terminally ill patients greater access to experimental treatments. He did make a concession \u2014 promising that the F.D.A. would find a way to make it easier for patients to get some of those treatments, although he noted that the agency already approves 99 percent of such requests. Mr. Trump also recently told Republican lawmakers that Dr. Gottlieb was leading the effort to get legislation passed by Congress.\n\nThat balancing act has also been on display in Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s approach to regulating tobacco. Last July, he sent tobacco stocks into a dive after he vowed to take aggressive steps to render cigarettes nonaddictive by forcing manufacturers to cut nicotine levels.\n\nBut even as he railed against big tobacco, Dr. Gottlieb softened the blow by delaying for several years the deadline for companies to comply with tough new rules on e-cigarettes, cigars and other products.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The product under review was the IQOS, a heated tobacco stick device that the company wanted to market as a healthier alternative to cigarettes.\n\nIf the industry can\u2019t overcome such hurdles for approval or finds the process too cumbersome and expensive \u2014 Philip Morris is spending billions of dollars developing smoking alternatives that would need agency approval \u2014 Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s efforts to straddle the division between public health and commerce could be hobbled.\n\nDespite the panel\u2019s rejection \u2014 the experts questioned the science behind the product \u2014 agency officials were quick to say they would continue reviewing Philip Morris\u2019s studies and would ask for more information.\n\nKenneth Warner, a tobacco control expert and dean emeritus of the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said he found it surprising that the F.D.A. was taking such strong steps to rein in the tobacco industry. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat ironic to me that it takes a Republican administration to think about a new regulation like that, that would have a benefit for public health,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongressional Democrats, though, are still smarting from Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for compliance with new e-cigarette rules, which took effect in 2016. The rules called for companies with products already on the market to disclose their contents and to prove their positive impact on public health in order to gain approval.\n\nBefore becoming commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb served on the board of directors of Kure, a retailer that sells e-cigarette products in lounge-like settings. He has since sold his stake in Kure and said he would recuse himself from any decisions involving the company for two years.\n\nTackling anger over drug prices\n\nHigh drug prices \u2014 and what to do about them \u2014 were a frequent topic of the last election, and the Trump administration seems poised to offer some new proposals in its budget.\n\nHere, Dr. Gottlieb has shifted the agency\u2019s position. F.D.A. officials have traditionally said that regulating prices is beyond the agency\u2019s purview. But Dr. Gottlieb has taken steps to encourage more competition for products that have lost patent protection, including shortening an agency backlog for approvals of new generic drugs and publishing a list of off-patent drugs for which there is no alternative.\n\nHe surprised critics by holding up for ridicule brand-name drug companies that had refused to supply would-be rivals with samples of their drugs to deter generic competition.\n\n\u201cEnd the shenanigans,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said at a Federal Trade Commission meeting in November.\n\nThe commissioner\u2019s actions so far are likely to do little to substantially lower prices for most Americans, and they notably do not address the towering prices that brand-name drugmakers set for their products.\n\nStill, Chester Davis Jr., president and chief executive of the Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents generic drug companies, was effusive. \u201cThe commissioner has been very effective in using his bully pulpit to shine a very bright light on anti-competitive practices,\u201d Mr. Davis said.\n\nAnother closely watched decision will be Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s response to the charged question of how broadly drug companies can market products for unapproved uses. The pharmaceutical industry has won some court cases by arguing that companies have a First Amendment right to promote products for conditions that have not been sanctioned by the agency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore becoming commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb supported so-called \u201coff label\u201d promotion. He has not yet moved to issue final guidelines, first proposed under the Obama administration, that will let drugmakers discuss unapproved uses with entities like insurance companies. He has also issued few warning letters to drug companies for deceptive advertising.\n\nAny decision the agency makes worries people like Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, who was at the F.D.A. in the Obama administration. \u201cIf the F.D.A. surrenders on First Amendment issues, there could be very serious consequences for the agency\u2019s ability to do its job,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Murray is still concerned about Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s leadership, saying the agency wasn\u2019t doing enough on nutrition or to keep children away from tobacco products. She added that \u201cthe F.D.A. is too often focused on doing what\u2019s best for massive corporations, rather than patients and families.\u201d\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, was also an early critic, but she has grown more supportive. \u201cDr. Gottlieb is willing to tackle tough problems,\u201d Senator Warren said. \u201cI let him know when I think he\u2019s got it wrong, and when he\u2019s got it right.\u201d\n\nJennifer Miller, an assistant professor and clinical trials transparency expert at New York University School of Medicine, said a pilot program started by Dr. Gottlieb, in which pharmaceutical firms voluntarily release information about their clinical studies for approved drugs, was a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe industry is already trending toward releasing them,\u201d Dr. Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe time to roll out a pilot. I think he\u2019ll likely be successful and learn what works and what didn\u2019t.\u201d", "keywords": ["companies", "products", "stereotype", "drug", "industry", "fda", "tobacco", "administration", "dr", "health", "goes", "agency", "chief", "gottlieb"], "polarity": 0.11106638223690246, "subjectivity": 0.42023753221730126},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/upshot/liberals-wanted-fiscal-stimulus-conservatives-delivered-it.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberals Wanted Fiscal Stimulus. Conservatives Delivered It. Left-leaning economists hate the timing and the composition. But the expansionary fiscal policy they sought is on the way. Image President Obama discussed fiscal stimulus in a meeting with governors in 2010. At the time, Republicans were typically more focused on the debt. Credit Luke Sharrett for The New York Times\n\nFor years, many liberal economists have argued that a little more federal spending and a higher budget deficit would create a stronger economy.\n\nNow, they\u2019re getting their wish, or at least a fun-house mirror version of it. All it took was total Republican control of the government.\n\nThe fiscal austerity that drove the budget deficit from around 9 percent of G.D.P. in 2010 to 3 percent in 2016 has, for practical purposes, been abandoned. First, Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill in December that sharply cut rates on businesses. Then last week they made a deal to undo budget caps demanded by the Republican House in 2011. President Trump signed that bill on Friday.\n\nThis sudden reversal has the economists who have long argued we should run the economy a little hot \u2014 that is, stimulate it using the government\u2019s power to tax and spend \u2014 in something of a quandary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird and conflicted feeling,\u201d said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who worked in the Obama White House. \u201cOn some level I should be happy, and I am sort of happy right now, but with some nontrivial caveats.\u201d\n\nHe and others in this boat don\u2019t at all like the composition of this particular easing of fiscal policy. It is focused on tax cuts for businesses, rather than on investment in roads and bridges or worker training. The latter would be the kinds of steps more likely to have long-term payoffs and to benefit working-class Americans, they believe. (A big chunk of the additional spending will go toward the military.)\n\nLiberal skeptics of this new age of anti-austerity also don\u2019t like the timing. Mr. Bernstein, no one\u2019s idea of a deficit hawk, notes that never in its modern history has the United States run deficits as large as those now on the horizon while the unemployment rate was as low as it is now. That creates the risk that the government will have less capacity to respond to future recessions.\n\nBut those misgivings aside, this mix of budget-busting policies will provide the best test in years of some ideas that have percolated among economists, especially but not exclusively on the left. The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, originally a George W. Bush nominee, spent years imploring Congress to spend more money in the near term to try to boost growth, to little avail.\n\nThe case for a more expansionary fiscal policy varies depending on the individual, but arguments have included:\n\nIt might spur more jobs at higher wages.\n\nCoax people who had dropped out of the labor force to look for work.\n\nFuel higher productivity growth.\n\nMitigate a global shortage of safe government bonds.\n\nHelp break the United States out of a prolonged cycle of sluggish growth and financial booms and busts.\n\nFor example, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, has been a leading advocate of the idea that \u201csecular stagnation\u201d has taken hold. The idea is that the economy is in a self-reinforcing pattern of low growth, low inflation and low interest rates, and that overreliance on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies to try to spur growth has fueled financial bubbles.\n\nTo escape that trap, Mr. Summers urged government to make large-scale investment in infrastructure. That investment, he said, would create jobs for men, a demographic that has disproportionately dropped out of the labor force. And it would improve the long-term economic potential of the United States, taking the pressure off the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies to achieve growth.\n\nHe argues now that the policies that the Trump administration and Congress have reached, while directionally the same as those he advocates, won\u2019t get the job done and carry risks.\n\n\u201cYes, I have favored more expansionary fiscal policy, and this is more expansionary fiscal policy,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the wrong kind of expansionary fiscal policy, and it\u2019s at the wrong time, at the rare moment when fiscal policy is likely to be almost entirely crowded out.\u201d\n\nExpect to hear that term, \u201ccrowded out,\u201d frequently in the economic debates of the years ahead.\n\nIn mainstream models of how the economy works, it\u2019s the idea that if the government runs budget deficits when the economy is at full employment, its borrowing won\u2019t spur new economic activity as desired. Instead, the borrowing will simply raise interest rates and squeeze out private-sector investment, resulting in no net improvement in the economy.\n\nThe decline in stock markets since Jan. 26, and the rise in Treasury bond yields, suggests investors are becoming wary of that happening in the coming years.\n\nAdvocates of fiscal stimulus during the 2008 recession and the slow recovery argued that crowding out wasn\u2019t a valid fear during that time. Vast economic resources, including workers and machines, were sitting on the sidelines, so the government had room to stimulate without causing a rise in interest rates.\n\nA common refrain \u2014 and the baseline for negotiations between the Obama administration and Republicans in the House \u2014 was that any short-term boost to spending had to be accompanied by longer-term deficit reduction. It was on those terms, for example, that stiff budget cuts known as \u201csequestration\u201d were partly reversed \u2014 with offsets to avoid raising the deficit over the ensuing decade.\n\n\u201cRepublicans were very tough about that,\u201d said Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers until President Trump took office and is now at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School. Now, a Republican Congress is agreeing to raise spending beyond those sequestration limits without other cuts to offset the increases. \u201cThis is very frustrating because it feels like one group of people are living by the rules, while another group is not living by the rules of economics or arithmetic.\u201d\n\nThe frustration of facing resistance to more expansionary fiscal policy during a period of high unemployment wasn\u2019t confined to liberals. As Fed chairman, Mr. Bernanke urged Congress to pair a higher short-term fiscal boost with long-term deficit reduction.\n\nAs recently as last year, he wrote that \u201cthere is still a case for fiscal policy action today,\u201d but that it should focus on improving the economy\u2019s productive capacity, \u201cfor example, through improved public infrastructure that makes our economy more efficient or tax reforms that promote private capital investment.\u201d\n\nStill, even if it isn\u2019t designed as the stimulus that advocates would prefer, and even if its timing is the direct opposite of what Keynesian economics might recommend, this may be the best test of some of the theories on expansionary fiscal policy that will come along.\n\n\u201cThis is a test of whether we\u2019re at full employment or not,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201c I think by knocking the unemployment rate down even further, we\u2019re going to get more real economic activity, not just more inflation. But now we\u2019re going to find out if I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

Gen. Mark Martins, the lead prosecutor, this past week to provide information about the basis for Mr. Rishikof\u2019s firing as a matter of so-called discovery, the process by which the government must turn over to the defense relevant information in its possession.\n\n\u201cThe firing fairly raises the question of whether it constituted unlawful influence on the convening authority, and we have an obligation to try to learn everything we can about that,\u201d Mr. Nevin said.\n\nGuilty pleas would offer a way out of a complex case that has been mired in years of pretrial hearings and is certain to face many more years of appeals if it ever gets to trial and results in convictions. Taxpayers have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars pursuing the case, and plea deals would bring earlier closure to victims\u2019 families.\n\nBut striking such a deal would mean giving up on winning death sentences against defendants accused of aiding the murder of nearly 3,000 people, and could amount to surrender over the idea of using military commissions to prosecute terrorism cases.\n\nMr. Rishikof was removed by Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, and Mr. Brown was removed by William S.

The Trump administration has shuttered the State Department office that negotiated detainee transfers.\n\nMr. Rishikof appears to have been pursuing separate discussions with different legal teams in the Sept. 11 case at various stages of development.\n\nJames Connell, a lawyer for another Sept. 11 defendant, Ammar al-Baluchi, said that the last concrete step in his settlement discussions with Mr. Rishikof was a meeting last fall, but that the question of Mr. Darbi\u2019s fate had slowed the talks.\n\n\u201cI said I could not seriously consider negotiating,\u201d Mr. Connell wrote in a text message, unless he knew whether Mr. Rishikof \u201ccould make an enforceable deal. I said we would talk again after Darbi transfer.\u201d\n\nThe Sept. 11 case defendants offered to plead guilty in late 2008, but the Obama administration then took office and shut down the commissions. It later decided to overhaul the system and keep it, but wanted to move the Sept. 11 case to civilian court. After Congress blocked that option, the Sept. 11 defendants were re-arraigned before a Guant\u00e1namo tribunal in 2012 \u2014 and pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYears of pretrial hearings and delays ensued. Last year, prosecutors completed providing the defense with the evidence the government believes it is entitled to see. But, in an illustration of the continuing complexities that settling the case would sidestep, defense lawyers are insisting that they must have a freer hand to try to learn more about the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s former \u201cblack site\u201d prisons, where their clients were tortured.\n\nThe strategy of defense lawyers is to focus on that torture as mitigation against potential death sentences and to seek suppression of statements their clients made to the F.B.I. shortly after the C.I.A. sent them to Guant\u00e1namo in 2007.\n\nThe evidence the government has turned over about that program includes summaries about what agency employees and contractors who served as guards, doctors and interrogators at the prisons saw and did. Most are described by codes, because the C.I.A. is determined to keep their identities secret.\n\nAfter providing those summaries, the prosecution told defense lawyers that they are not allowed to directly approach people they believe might be such witnesses or to travel to countries they believe might have hosted prisons to ask questions. Rather, the defense must go through the government to request interviews, they said \u2014 hinting that defense lawyers could be prosecuted for spilling classified secrets if they disobey.\n\nBut Mr. Connell said defense lawyers had an ethical obligation to independently seek additional details that might persuade members of the jurylike commission to spare their clients\u2019 lives \u2014 suggesting that the rival imperatives are creating an irreconcilable conflict.\n\nThe issue \u201csort of blew up out of nowhere, but in another way, it is a long time coming,\u201d Mr. Connell told the judge at a hearing last month.", "keywords": ["911", "sent", "guant\u00e1namo", "11", "mr", "suspects", "official", "lawyers", "exploring", "deals", "pentagon", "rishikof", "plea", "defense", "sept", "fired", "case", "trump", "office"], "polarity": 0.0487542839105339, "subjectivity": 0.413441332972583},

They often argue that doctors and hospitals billed the government for services that were not medically necessary or not properly documented.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn view of the new policy, said Lindsey E. Gabrielsen, a lawyer in the Boston office of the law firm Foley & Lardner, the government \u201cwill face serious hurdles\u201d in enforcement actions based on violations of health care guidance documents.\n\nEnvironmental and civil rights lawyers are reaching similar conclusions.\n\nSidley Austin, a large corporate law firm, recently advised clients that the new Justice Department policy \u201chas major implications\u201d for federal efforts to enforce the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The Justice Department, Sidley said, \u201crelies heavily on Environmental Protection Agency guidance documents to establish violations of law.\u201d\n\nOn civil rights, Barry L. Goldstein, a lawyer in Oakland, Calif., who handles such cases, called the policy shift \u201cextraordinary\u201d and said it was \u201cstepping away from guidelines that have been essential for effective enforcement of civil rights laws for 40 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has successfully used the guidelines to establish violations of fair employment law before the Supreme Court and other courts,\u201d Mr. Goldstein added.\n\nThe new policy also has implications for companies that do business with the government.\n\n\u201cCivil prosecutors have one less tool in their enforcement toolbox,\u201d said Emily S. Theriault, a Washington lawyer who represents military contractors. \u201cThe Brand memo puts government contractors in a better position when negotiating and defending False Claims Act cases where they are accused of violating a government policy as part of a so-called conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nMs. Brand, the associate attorney general, worked at the Justice Department under President George W. Bush and later, as a senior member of the litigation team at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, challenged a handful of federal regulations. When the Senate considered her nomination last year, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said she had long championed \u201cthe rolling back of vital environmental, consumer and labor regulations.\u201d\n\nBut she and her supporters said she was simply representing the views of her client, the Chamber of Commerce. On Friday, the Justice Department announced that she was leaving her post and returning to the private sector. She is taking the top legal position at Walmart.\n\nLawrence Z. Lorber, a labor law specialist who represents employers, said the Labor Department often used guidance documents in enforcing wage and hour laws and laws banning job discrimination by federal contractors.\n\nUnder one such directive, the Labor Department periodically audits the pay practices of federal contractors. If it finds discrimination on the basis of sex or race, it can require employers to provide millions of dollars in back pay to the victims. A separate directive describes how the government will identify victims and calculate back pay.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce, which has complained for years about \u201coverzealous enforcement\u201d of the False Claims Act, welcomed the new policy.

Moore, the Republican candidate who lost his bid for an Alabama Senate seat after being accused of child predation, and Bill O\u2019Reilly, the disgraced TV personality who, along with his former employer, Fox News, paid tens of millions of dollars to settle sexual harassment claims.\n\nMr. Trump, critics noted, has not let due process prevent him from rushing to judgment in other cases. He has avidly promoted conspiracy theories, like those of the birther movement, whipped up his supporters at campaign rallies with chants of \u201clock her up\u201d about Hillary Clinton, and demanded the death penalty for five young black and Latino men wrongly accused of assaulting and raping a white woman in Central Park.\n\nFor the #MeToo movement, which has spread into virtually every corner of American society \u2014 redressing a legacy of injustice even as it wrestles with questions like the dangers of a rush to judgment \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s words were sure to make him, yet again, a lightning rod.\n\nHis apparent defense of his two aides \u2014 Rob Porter, the staff secretary, and David Sorensen, a speechwriter \u2014 ran counter to the White House\u2019s portrayal of its response to the accusations of emotional and physical abuse leveled against them. Administration officials maintained that they acted decisively in each case.\n\nBut it was in keeping with the White House\u2019s initially defensive reaction to the charges against Mr. Porter \u2014 a messy trail of conflicting statements that has left the West Wing in turmoil, with angry officials pointing fingers at one another.\n\nThe White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, staunchly defended Mr. Porter initially. Ms. Sanders said the president had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in his performance, while Mr. Kelly described him as \u201ca man of true integrity and honor.\u201d\n\nYet the allegations against Mr. Porter and Mr. Sorensen were longstanding, well documented, and at least in Mr. Porter\u2019s case, known to the White House for months, even as he held one of the West Wing\u2019s most sensitive positions, channeling paperwork to the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives, Jennifer Willoughby, obtained a restraining order against him, while the other, Colbie Holderness, presented a photograph of herself with a black eye, which she said came from being hit by Mr. Porter while the couple was on vacation in Italy.\n\nThe F.B.I. informed the White House of these charges, which held up Mr. Porter\u2019s application for a permanent security clearance. Mr. Kelly has told his staff he ordered Mr. Porter to be fired 40 minutes after learning of the charges, an assertion that other officials disputed.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Sorensen, his former wife, Jessica Corbett, told F.B.I. agents conducting a background check on her husband that he had run over her foot while driving a car and extinguished a cigarette on her hand during a turbulent two-and-a-half-year marriage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lieu, a Democrat from California, said on Twitter. \u201cVictims deserve due process as well.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has a history of coming to the defense of accused men. In addition to Mr. Moore and Mr. O\u2019Reilly, he defended Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, who resigned amid multiple allegations of misconduct; Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who was charged with battery after grabbing the arm of a female reporter; and Mike Tyson, the boxer who went to jail for raping an 18-year-old beauty queen.\n\nFrequently, Mr. Trump notes that the charges are old, that they might not be true and that the accused has denied them.\n\n\u201cForty years is a long time,\u201d he said of allegations that Mr. Moore had molested girls as young as 14. \u201cHe\u2019s run eight races, and this has never came up.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Mr. Lewandowski, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s a fine person, he\u2019s a very good person. And I don\u2019t want to destroy a man. If you let him go, you would destroy a man, destroy a family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDozens of women have accused Mr. Trump himself of sexual harassment during his years as a real estate developer, reality-TV star and beauty pageant owner. He has consistently denied the charges, often in terms not unlike those he uses in defending other men.\n\n\u201cA lot of things get made up over the years,\u201d he said in 2016, responding to an investigation by The New York Times that detailed what multiple women described as lewd comments and unwelcome advances. \u201cI have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call for due process does reflect a fear shared by others that the #MeToo movement has gained so much momentum that in some cases, men accused of misconduct are being judged too quickly or punished too severely for sexual behavior that falls into a gray area.\n\nYet Mr. Trump has been quick to judge in other instances. In the 1989 case of the Central Park jogger, Mr. Trump bought a full-page ad in newspapers calling for the five suspects to be given the death penalty. Even after the convictions against the men were dropped 13 years later, Mr. Trump insisted they were guilty.\n\n\u201cYou falsely alleged rape by the #CentralParkFive even AFTER they were exonerated, but said nothing about due process for 5 black boys,\u201d Cornell William Brooks, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in a tweet. \u201cFor 2 white men accused of wife beating, you argue due process. Due process applies to more than @WhiteHouse staff or white men.\u201d\n\nTo some critics, Mr. Trump\u2019s defensive tone on Saturday was less a setback for the #MeToo movement than evidence of its success \u2014 a political and social tidal wave crashing on the doorstep of the White House.\n\n\u201cTrump is now tweeting to legitimize domestic violence,\u201d said Amy Siskind, who publishes a weekly list on the web of how Mr. Trump is changing the country. \u201cLike months ago when he defended a pedophile.

Melissa Mather, the communications director at Family Health Centers, said she worried that patients like him, who already stumble over Medicaid\u2019s paperwork requirements, will be more lost under the new rules. She and Mr. Wagner are also worried about their homeless patients, who will be subject to the rules unless they meet the federal definition of \u201cchronically homeless\u201d and get an exemption.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very big concern from my perspective \u2014 talking about the complexity of these changes when a lot of the folks we deal with have lives that are in chaos already,\u201d she said.\n\nFor now, there are more questions than answers, as state workers like Ms. Putnam hustle to iron out all the details, let alone explain them.

At 17, she was accepted to Harvard University, where she planned to study medicine.\n\nBut her mother died of breast cancer three weeks before school started. \u201cI failed a bunch of classes,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cI was just depressed.\u201d She took a year off, returned to Brooklyn \u2014 staying with an aunt and working a temp job at Columbia Pictures \u2014 and then switched her major to documentary filmmaking.\n\n\u201cI was thinking Hollywood movies,\u201d she said. \u201cCome to find out Harvard doesn\u2019t do that. So I had to study documentary.\u201d\n\nMs. Reid had also always been captivated by politics. In the late 1990s she moved to Miami to write for a local television morning show. There, she became a fixture among South Florida lawmakers. She was involved in minority outreach for voter education and blogged. In 2005 she met James Thomas, a longtime disc jockey and radio veteran known as James T, who hired her to produce a talk radio show for listeners in the black community.\n\n\u201cI had to convince her of the power we had in radio in Miami,\u201d Mr. Thomas said in an interview. \u201cWe were going to go to places people didn\u2019t want to go.\u201d This included Opa-locka, a town marred by gang violence and political corruption whose residents she interviewed. \u201cWe had Lou Dobbs on and Marco Rubio,\u201d Mr. Thomas said, laughing, referring to the conservative Fox Business Network host and the Republican Florida senator. \u201cShe loved to debate.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Ms. Reid was named managing editor of theGrio.com, a news and analysis website aimed at an African-American audience. (By then she was also writing op-ed columns for The Miami Herald and appearing as a commentator on cable news.) Chris Witherspoon, now a correspondent for the movie ticket seller Fandango.com, was rewriting news briefs for the site when she arrived. \u201cJoy said, \u2018You are way too fabulous to be behind your desk,\u2019\u201d he recalled.

She remembered a party her friend, who lives in Brooklyn, had in December. There were some celebrities, sure. \u201cShe also had the women who helped raise her, her cousins and their children. Those are the V.I.P.s in her life.\u201d\n\nMs. Reid got her television break in 2014 when she was hired by MSNBC to create a daily show called \u201cThe Reid Report.\u201d It was short-lived, though, canceled the next year because of poor ratings (along with Ronan Farrow\u2019s). \u201cIt was stressful because it was daily,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cThere was a lot more management eyes on us.

In 2015, she went to Mississippi to investigate the death of a man found hanging from a tree, suspended by a bedsheet, which some people said could have been a lynching. \u201cI literally have never had an experience where I felt almost like I was waking through a haunting,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could just feel the ghosts of Mississippi past everywhere you went.\u201d\n\nA few months later, Ms. Reid investigated why black churches were being burned down in Southern states, visiting a church in South Carolina that was across the street from a dark forest. \u201cYou could almost transport yourself back to the 19th century and see the enslaved people running, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cEverything about it had this omnipresent sort of pallor that I think America doesn\u2019t want to deal with.\u201d\n\nShe traveled to 10 states in eight months. \u201cI think it was good for her,\u201d said Phil Griffin, president of MSNBC. \u201cI tried to explain that to her.

Ms. Reid\u2019s talk show panel was made up of women that reflected conservative, minority and liberal viewpoints.\n\nIn her class for Syracuse, which she teaches in Manhattan, Ms. Reid addresses the precarious definition of what the president calls \u201cfake news,\u201d and why it is a dangerous concept. \u201cNow, something is \u2018true\u2019 because you like it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the information is displeasing to you or makes you uncomfortable, or is in opposition to your ideology, then it is \u2018fake.\u2019\u201d She is concerned consumers of news will isolate themselves, believing only what makes them feel good. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor her, Twitter is a tool to combat critics.

Mr. French shot back that she had misconstrued his comments. Ms. Reid had not read his article, but a summary from another news outlet. She apologized.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s human,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all are guilty of skimming the articles or reading the headlines.\u201d\n\nIn December, she was widely criticized for decade-old blog posts that mocked former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. In the mid-2000s, she wrote that he was a closeted gay man whose marriage to a woman gave him political cover. She apologized to him and others she may have disappointed.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/climate/trump-infrastructure-climate-change.html", "text": "A White House spokeswoman, who asked to remain anonymous because the plan was not yet public, declined to discuss whether climate change reports were considered in the preparation of Mr. Trump\u2019s blueprint. \u201cThe president\u2019s team spent almost a full year formulating his infrastructure plan and all relevant scientific data was considered,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.\n\nSince the beginning of his administration, Mr. Trump and his appointees have steadily worked to roll back climate change regulations. Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. chief, Scott Pruitt, has taken the lead role in the administration\u2019s efforts to undo climate policies and question the validity of climate science. On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt suggested that global warming could benefit humanity.\n\nThose views are contradicted by research conducted by his own agency.\n\nThe 2017 E.P.A. report warned that some 6,000 bridges nationwide face a greater risk of damage in coming decades from the effects of a warming climate. It provides analysis showing that \u201cproactive adaptation\u201d \u2014 essentially, planning for global warming before you build \u2014 could save the government up to 70 percent in future costs of repairing damage caused by climate change-driven weather events such as deluges, coastal flooding and heat waves.\n\nPhoto\n\nA spokeswoman for the E.P.A. did not respond to requests to interview the study\u2019s lead scientist, Jeremy Martinich. An academic colleague of Mr. Martinich\u2019s, who has worked with him on several climate reports, including the E.P.A. study published last year, described in practical terms what the findings mean for federal infrastructure planners.\n\n\u201cSay you\u2019re going to build a new road in Denver that\u2019s designed to last for 25 years,\u201d said the colleague, Paul Chinowsky, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \u201cWhat climate science tells us is that, over the next 25 years, the climate in Denver is going to look more like the climate in Albuquerque\u201d \u2014 meaning, he said, that the asphalt will have to be designed to withstand much higher levels of heat than a Denver road might historically have experienced.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, \u201cIt could double the cost of maintenance and the amount of delays on that road.\u201d\n\nIn New England and the Upper Midwest, Mr. Chinowsky said, failing to account for climate change when planning the asphalt mix for roads there could mean that more rapid cycles of winter freezes and thaws could cause more potholes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you think places like Wisconsin, Minnesota and New England have potholes now, just wait,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Chinowsky also pointed to a 2015 study he helped write that focused on the Southeast, in particular an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 85 between Atlanta and Alabama. Over the next 50 years, stronger rainstorms were estimated to cause up to $118 million in damage to the highway and surrounding feeder roads, the study found.\n\nOther scientific and engineering studies make the case that rising sea levels will erode coastal highways in Florida, stronger rains will send rivers flooding bridges in Iowa and more powerful heat waves will melt asphalt across the Southwest.\n\nFor instance, the 2014 National Climate Assessment concluded climate changes will disrupt the reliability and capacity of the nation\u2019s transportation systems, including an increase in flooding of airports, harbors and tunnels. It found that runways in 13 of the nation\u2019s largest airports are vulnerable to flooding from higher storm surges driven by climate change. It also found that, absent planning, municipal drainage systems will overflow.\n\nThe impact of climate change on Alaskan infrastructure is expected to be particularly severe.\n\nAlready the Alaska Highway, built atop permafrost that was never expected to go away, has started buckling as the permafrost melts. A 2010 study concluded that the highway is one of the state\u2019s 4,576 miles of paved road, 5,000 miles of unpaved road, 253 airports, 853 bridges, 131 harbors and 819 miles of railroad that could be damaged by a warming climate in coming decades. The study concluded that the impact of climate change on Alaska\u2019s infrastructure could reach up to $7.6 billion by through 2080.\n\nIn Iowa, meanwhile, a 2008 rainstorm sent the waters of the Cedar River pouring over the Interstate 80 bridge, closing it for four days and sending drivers on a 120-mile detour. The impact of climate change in the Hawkeye State will threaten nearly 3,000 bridges in coming years, according to the author of a 2015 report by the Iowa Department of Transportation.\n\n\u201cWith climate change and infrastructure, it\u2019s pay me now, or pay me later,\u201d said Eugene S. Takle, a co-author of that study and director of the climate-science program at Iowa State University. \u201cPay a lot more later.\u201d", "keywords": ["iowa", "flooding", "warming", "plan", "mr", "infrastructure", "road", "ignore", "costly", "trumps", "climate", "study", "epa", "change"], "polarity": 0.12182462927143778, "subjectivity": 0.33805609284332694},

It was created by an Act of Congress in 1962 and opened to the public in 1968. (The Obama unveiling is billed as part of its 50th birthday celebrations.) By the time it began collecting, many chief executive portraits of note were already housed elsewhere. (The collection of first lady portraits is still incomplete; commissioning new ones started only in 2006.)\n\nThere are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLandsdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ \u201cIt\u2019s going to be, like, boom!?\u201d Read our interview with the artist Kehinde Wiley. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a beige suit for a black one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["obama", "mrs", "mr", "fact", "sherald", "portrait", "paint", "obamas", "fiction", "wiley", "black", "ms", "politics", "blend", "portraits"], "polarity": 0.07512346068171309, "subjectivity": 0.36038996063267925},

The film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter, according to the online vendor Fandango, surpassing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the 2017 live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\nThe morning after a red-carpet premiere in Hollywood last month that left Twitter swooning, the stars, director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the African diaspora on screen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda; Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Nakia, a Wakandan spy and T\u2019Challa\u2019s love interest); Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger, an African-American adversary of Black Panther\u2019s); Danai Gurira (Okoye, Wakanda\u2019s greatest warrior); and Kevin Feige, a producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and president of Marvel Studios. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nI read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations.\n\n[Rolling laughter]\n\nCHADWICK BOSEMAN I still want my reparations! I still want my reparations!\n\nRYAN COOGLER [laughing] I think only reparations can be reparations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s silly, but is there a kernel of truth there for any of you? The idea that Disney and Marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution?\n\nDANAI GURIRA What it does in such a beautiful way, to me, is it sets a precedent. We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now. People can\u2019t go back and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s going to be too hard, it\u2019s Africa.\u201d They can\u2019t do that. And that is so thrilling to me.\n\nMICHAEL B. JORDAN It couldn\u2019t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it\u2019s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody\u2019s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn\u2019t think were lucrative, didn\u2019t think that anybody wanted to see. All of that, I feel, is getting ready to dissolve.\n\nBOSEMAN It has to.\n\nGURIRA No, it will.\n\nCOOGLER What I\u2019ll say is, this is my second time working in the studio system, and they say it\u2019s the studio system, but it\u2019s really the people system. It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. And I think he\u2019s delivered a movie that\u2019s going to do that, and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies you\u2019ve done?\n\nBOSEMAN I\u2019ve done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past, but this not only refers to the past, it sets the stage for where we\u2019re going.\n\nGURIRA I\u2019ve had a passion for telling African stories for a really long time, being American-born and Zimbabwe-raised. That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan \u2014 I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you\u2019re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, \u201cOh wow, we\u2019re all in it together? And y\u2019all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel. [Ms. Nyong\u2019o was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents and raised in Kenya.]\n\nPhoto\n\nBOSEMAN A lot of times, being [a black man] in Hollywood, when you get material you\u2019ll read it and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not us.\u201d When I got the initial call from Kevin Feige, my hope was that they would have the courage to give Black Panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be.

I was a wide receiver \u2014 they throw you the ball, you can\u2019t drop it. So I learned that you gotta tune everything else out.\n\nIf I get to set and there\u2019s a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and Lupita is dressed in this adornment and Danai is dressed in this adornment and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey Ryan, do I stand here or here?\u201d I can\u2019t think, \u201cAh, this is amazing, I\u2019m making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and there\u2019s all these black folks on screen!\u201d I really gotta tell Danai that she needs to move over here, and I gotta tell her five reasons why she\u2019s gotta move over here, because she\u2019s gonna wanna know \u2019em! [Laughter]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that I\u2019m making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t be no good to anybody.\n\nNYONG\u2019O A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg\u2019s] \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn that moment, I was like, \u201cThis is big.\u201d I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.\n\nMichael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killgore\u2019s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T\u2019Challa\u2019s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?\n\nJORDAN Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["democrats", "vote", "mr", "gillespies", "white", "ads", "voters", "ms13", "republicans", "virginia", "win", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["matter", "americans", "harlem", "showed", "white", "america", "blacks", "movement", "black", "lives", "renaissance"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["campaign", "met", "end", "africa", "mr", "company", "pottinger", "main", "south", "rogues", "reading", "guptas", "bell", "firm", "despots", "pr"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Often, this work is done by women who are later overlooked; in the case of the civil rights struggle, for instance, women like Jo Ann Robinson and Georgia Gilmore fund-raised for and organized the Montgomery bus boycott.

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["supremacy", "womens", "women", "white", "whitesupremacist", "work", "american", "racial", "politics", "power", "men"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees. Last week, at a meeting in Budapest of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of central European nations, Mr. Orban said, \u201cWe do not wish to become a destination country for migrants.\u201d\n\nThe media here has offered widespread support to Mr. Okovacs for bringing back a popular production after decades.

As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained:\n\nSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no.

He embodies them.\n\nThis week, Tony Perkins, leader of the Family Research Council, told Politico that Trump gets a \u201cmulligan,\u201d or do-over, on his past moral transgressions, because he\u2019s willing to stand up to the religious right\u2019s enemies.

Trump\u2019s religious champions, Michael Gerson writes in The Washington Post, are \u201cassociating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception. They are playing a grubby political game for the highest of stakes: the reputation of their faith.\u201d\n\nI sympathize with his distress. But the politicized sectors of conservative evangelicalism have been associated with bigotry, selfishness and deception for a long time. Trump has simply revealed the movement\u2019s priorities. It values the preservation of traditional racial and sexual hierarchies over fuzzier notions of wholesomeness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve resisted throughout my career the notion that evangelicals are racist, I really have,\u201d Balmer told me. \u201cBut I think the 2016 election demonstrated that the religious right was circling back to the founding principles of the movement. What happened in 2016 is that the religious right dropped all pretense that theirs was a movement about family values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is one reason I find it hard to take seriously religious conservatives who say they are being persecuted for their defense of traditional marriage. People who are sympathetic to Christian, conservative Trump supporters \u2014 even if they don\u2019t support Trump themselves \u2014 will say that they\u2019ve been backed into a corner by the expansion of civil rights laws and policies protecting gay people. As they see it, liberals not only won the culture war on gay marriage but now are also demanding that private redoubts of resistance be brought into line.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 gay-marriage decision, Rod Dreher, a social-conservative Trump critic, wrote, \u201cPost-Obergefell, Christians who hold to the biblical teaching about sex and marriage have the same status in culture, and increasingly in law, as racists.\u201d\n\nDreher obviously thinks they deserve much better. He sees a fundamental difference between Christians who thought their religious freedom was trampled by desegregation and Christians who think their religious freedom is trampled when their business and charities have to serve gay people.\n\nBut it seems absurd to ask secular people to respect the religious right\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage \u2014 and thus tolerate a degree of anti-gay discrimination \u2014 while the movement\u2019s leaders treat their own sexual standards as flexible and conditional. Christian conservatives may believe strongly in their own righteousness.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830. She takes readers along on her research journey through disparate records, but ultimately concludes that Harriet Hemings \u201cwill keep her secret.\u201d\n\nThe last chapter, \u201cLegacies,\u201d ruminates on the fate of each of the women from a contemporary perspective. Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day. And Harriet, who passed as white, most likely abandoning her family in the process, prompts Kerrison to wonder about the persistence of racism in American society.

His tactics in Birmingham were geared toward maximum media impact. Marches were scheduled to accommodate the evening news \u2014 and when recruits were scarce, Mr. Walker counted on spectators to inflate the white newsmen\u2019s troop count. (\u201cMarchers, spectators?\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cTo them we all looked alike.\u201d) He finessed a call from President Kennedy to Coretta Scott King when her husband was jailed, and came up with the idea for King to write his jailhouse epistle. His efforts to get \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d published didn\u2019t bear fruit until the campaign succeeded.\n\nMost important, Mr. Walker had known from the start that mass moral witnesses, such as the nonviolent marches led by praying ministers, would not be enough to turn public opinion against segregation and get the desired federal intervention. He would need the segregationists to act out visually the violence and evil at the system\u2019s core. When Mr. Connor briefly deployed the German Shepherds in early April, Mr. Walker exulted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs.\u201d Within a month, he got his picture, and King the credit for bringing down American apartheid.\n\nThirty-six years later in New York, March 1999, I was struck by echoes of Birmingham in the protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the unpunished police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. A photograph of one of the protesters \u2014 Mr. Giuliani\u2019s predecessor David Dinkins, New York\u2019s first and so far only black mayor \u2014 who was cuffed along with Representative Charles Rangel, reminded me especially of a picture of King and his deputy Ralph Abernathy being arrested in Birmingham on Good Friday, 1963. It didn\u2019t surprise me to discover Mr. Walker\u2019s fingerprints all over these electrifying demonstrations. He was at the time on the board of the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, which organized the protests.\n\nTwo years later, when my book on Birmingham came out, I brought a magazine photographer to Mr. Walker\u2019s church to take our picture. He fixed me with his perfectionist glare and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you journalists that makes you think Dr. King was so namby-pamby.\u201d\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Walker was nine years ago, at a King holiday event in Dallas. He had retired from Harlem\u2019s Canaan Baptist and moved to Virginia in the aftermath of strokes that left him dependent on a wheelchair and incapable of much facial expression, though his eyes still radiated trouble and his mouth still delivered the gibes.\n\nWe clutched hands in front of a TV, watching the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States.

In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations.

Although I am a conservative professor, I recommend making a concession to it by explicitly assigning writers of different races and social backgrounds. Let me explain.\n\nWhen I was in college, I took a class in logic. There I learned that one should never reject an argument because of the characteristics of the person making it. Instead, one should assess the argument itself on its rational merits. And while I agree that the power of an argument should not depend on the person making it, nonetheless, it does.\n\nI learned that lesson during my first year as a visiting professor at Cornell University. I taught a course on American evangelicals, which attracted a mix of secular and religious students. When we discussed \u201cThe Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,\u201d a 1994 book by Mark A. Noll about anti-intellectualism in the evangelical tradition, my evangelical students were critical of it. But they were willing to take the book\u2019s thesis seriously because the author was an evangelical.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Noll\u2019s identity shouldn\u2019t have mattered. His historical evidence and the power of his arguments would be worth considering even if he were Catholic, Jewish or secular. But his identity did matter. It mattered because my evangelical students could not simply assume bad faith on the author\u2019s part. They knew Mr. Noll cared about evangelicals as a group of people. Instead of dismissing Mr. Noll as a bigot, my students thoughtfully engaged with his work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I currently teach a course called Black Intellectuals, which is focused on debates around racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. It tends to attract progressive students who, in analyzing racial inequality, are drawn to arguments that stress structural obstacles to equality and the enduring power of white racism, especially in our criminal justice system. The course features black authors who do defend that view, but I also teach the work of others who depart from it in some measure, including heterodox thinkers like Thomas Chatterton Williams and conservatives like Jason Riley. Much like my conservative evangelical students at Cornell, my progressive students at Claremont McKenna College are less likely to assume these contrarian black thinkers are acting in bad faith or are motivated by bigotry \u2014 even when the thinkers criticize hip-hop culture or defend white police officers. So the students engage the challenging arguments and ideas instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs conservatives have long observed and psychologists have since confirmed, human beings are hive-minded animals whose moral judgments are shaped more by sentiments than by reason. Thus, when we are confronted by arguments we disagree with, we can easily find reasons to reject them. The search for disconfirming evidence, however, can sometimes be short-circuited, especially when we feel close to the person making an argument we disagree with. As the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt concluded in his 2012 book, \u201cThe Righteous Mind,\u201d if we have \u201caffection, admiration, or desire to please\u201d other people, we lean toward them and attempt to \u201cfind the truth\u201d in their arguments.

American law did not allow Asians to obtain citizenship until 1952.\n\nUnder the pressure of anti-racist and immigrant rights pressure, the system fell in 1965 with the passage of the Hart-Celler Act, which foregrounded family reunification, refugee admissions and the entry of the highly skilled and educated.

In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the principle that immigrants from Muslim-majority countries required special scrutiny and restriction was central to the remaking of immigration policy in the name of national security.\n\nThe prevailing questions we\u2019re conditioned to ask about immigrants have all been deeply shaped by histories of racial restriction.

By the time it began collecting, many chief executive portraits of note were already housed elsewhere. (The collection of first lady portraits is still incomplete; commissioning new ones started only in 2006.)\n\nThere are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLandsdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair.

In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind.

How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close.

Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["obama", "mrs", "mr", "fact", "sherald", "portrait", "paint", "obamas", "fiction", "wiley", "black", "ms", "politics", "blend", "portraits"], "polarity": 0.07512346068171309, "subjectivity": 0.36038996063267925},

The film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter, according to the online vendor Fandango, surpassing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the 2017 live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\nThe morning after a red-carpet premiere in Hollywood last month that left Twitter swooning, the stars, director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the African diaspora on screen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays T\u2019Challa, a.k.a.

The idea that Disney and Marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution?\n\nDANAI GURIRA What it does in such a beautiful way, to me, is it sets a precedent. We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now.

JORDAN It couldn\u2019t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it\u2019s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody\u2019s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn\u2019t think were lucrative, didn\u2019t think that anybody wanted to see.

It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe.

That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie.

And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["democrats", "vote", "mr", "gillespies", "white", "ads", "voters", "ms13", "republicans", "virginia", "win", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["matter", "americans", "harlem", "showed", "white", "america", "blacks", "movement", "black", "lives", "renaissance"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["campaign", "met", "end", "africa", "mr", "company", "pottinger", "main", "south", "rogues", "reading", "guptas", "bell", "firm", "despots", "pr"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Often, this work is done by women who are later overlooked; in the case of the civil rights struggle, for instance, women like Jo Ann Robinson and Georgia Gilmore fund-raised for and organized the Montgomery bus boycott.

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["supremacy", "womens", "women", "white", "whitesupremacist", "work", "american", "racial", "politics", "power", "men"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees.

But, as my colleague Linda Qiu reported two weeks ago, the record is the culmination of a longer trend, and there has been no shift in the larger racial unemployment gap:\n\nThe 6.8 percent unemployment rate for black Americans in December is indeed the lowest since 1972, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets \u2014 as Mr. Trump suggests.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s an open question whether a president can claim credit for economic outputs like unemployment. As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained:\n\nSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no. If you think that what really matters is the mood in the executive suite, then just maybe.\n\nJay-Z is scheduled to appear at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Trump\u2019s religious champions, Michael Gerson writes in The Washington Post, are \u201cassociating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception. They are playing a grubby political game for the highest of stakes: the reputation of their faith.\u201d\n\nI sympathize with his distress. But the politicized sectors of conservative evangelicalism have been associated with bigotry, selfishness and deception for a long time. Trump has simply revealed the movement\u2019s priorities. It values the preservation of traditional racial and sexual hierarchies over fuzzier notions of wholesomeness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve resisted throughout my career the notion that evangelicals are racist, I really have,\u201d Balmer told me. \u201cBut I think the 2016 election demonstrated that the religious right was circling back to the founding principles of the movement. What happened in 2016 is that the religious right dropped all pretense that theirs was a movement about family values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is one reason I find it hard to take seriously religious conservatives who say they are being persecuted for their defense of traditional marriage. People who are sympathetic to Christian, conservative Trump supporters \u2014 even if they don\u2019t support Trump themselves \u2014 will say that they\u2019ve been backed into a corner by the expansion of civil rights laws and policies protecting gay people. As they see it, liberals not only won the culture war on gay marriage but now are also demanding that private redoubts of resistance be brought into line.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 gay-marriage decision, Rod Dreher, a social-conservative Trump critic, wrote, \u201cPost-Obergefell, Christians who hold to the biblical teaching about sex and marriage have the same status in culture, and increasingly in law, as racists.\u201d\n\nDreher obviously thinks they deserve much better. He sees a fundamental difference between Christians who thought their religious freedom was trampled by desegregation and Christians who think their religious freedom is trampled when their business and charities have to serve gay people.\n\nBut it seems absurd to ask secular people to respect the religious right\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage \u2014 and thus tolerate a degree of anti-gay discrimination \u2014 while the movement\u2019s leaders treat their own sexual standards as flexible and conditional.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830.

Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day. And Harriet, who passed as white, most likely abandoning her family in the process, prompts Kerrison to wonder about the persistence of racism in American society.

His tactics in Birmingham were geared toward maximum media impact. Marches were scheduled to accommodate the evening news \u2014 and when recruits were scarce, Mr. Walker counted on spectators to inflate the white newsmen\u2019s troop count. (\u201cMarchers, spectators?\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cTo them we all looked alike.\u201d) He finessed a call from President Kennedy to Coretta Scott King when her husband was jailed, and came up with the idea for King to write his jailhouse epistle. His efforts to get \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d published didn\u2019t bear fruit until the campaign succeeded.\n\nMost important, Mr. Walker had known from the start that mass moral witnesses, such as the nonviolent marches led by praying ministers, would not be enough to turn public opinion against segregation and get the desired federal intervention. He would need the segregationists to act out visually the violence and evil at the system\u2019s core. When Mr. Connor briefly deployed the German Shepherds in early April, Mr. Walker exulted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs.\u201d Within a month, he got his picture, and King the credit for bringing down American apartheid.\n\nThirty-six years later in New York, March 1999, I was struck by echoes of Birmingham in the protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the unpunished police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. A photograph of one of the protesters \u2014 Mr. Giuliani\u2019s predecessor David Dinkins, New York\u2019s first and so far only black mayor \u2014 who was cuffed along with Representative Charles Rangel, reminded me especially of a picture of King and his deputy Ralph Abernathy being arrested in Birmingham on Good Friday, 1963. It didn\u2019t surprise me to discover Mr. Walker\u2019s fingerprints all over these electrifying demonstrations. He was at the time on the board of the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, which organized the protests.\n\nTwo years later, when my book on Birmingham came out, I brought a magazine photographer to Mr. Walker\u2019s church to take our picture.

Wyatt Tee Walker, center, in 1961 with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and another King aide, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, in Montgomery, Ala. Credit Getty Images\n\nThe Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, who was chief of staff to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a key strategist behind civil rights protests that turned the tide against racial injustice in the Jim Crow South of the 1960s, died early on Tuesday at an assisted-living facility near his home in Chester, Va. He was 88.\n\nHis death was announced by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Dr. Walker was the organization\u2019s first board chairman of the National Action Network, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s organization.\n\nDr. Walker preached against intolerance and racial inequality for six decades from pulpits across the South, in New York City and in five of the world\u2019s seven continents. He helped supervise South Africa\u2019s first fully representative elections in 1994, when Nelson Mandela\u2019s rise to power ushered in the end of the apartheid regime.\n\nBut much of his impact was felt closer to home. For 37 years he was a towering community figure as the pastor at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem, and from 1965 to 1975 he was a special assistant on urban affairs to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. In both posts he was a strong advocate of affordable housing and better schools in the low-income neighborhoods of Upper Manhattan.\n\nDr. Walker\u2019s work as a civil rights advocate began in 1953, soon after he finished his graduate studies at the historically black Virginia Union University in Richmond. He had met Dr. King while both were students.\n\nThe two had been presidents of their classes \u2014 Dr. King at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania \u2014 and they had their first encounter during an inter-seminary meeting.\n\nDr. Walker joined the fledgling Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1961 and served until 1964 as its executive director and, unofficially, as Dr. King\u2019s right-hand man. At the S.C.L.C., he devised a structured fund-raising strategy and organized numerous protests, including a series of anti-segregation boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., that came to be known as Project C.\n\nThe C stood for \u201cconfrontation,\u201d and the project is regarded as the blueprint for the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South.\n\n\u201cThe federal government was against us, the local communities were against us, the judges were against us, but we managed to do it, and I guess we found the strength to do it because it was a moral fight,\u201d Dr. Walker said in an interview for this obituary in 2006.\n\n\u201cI was fully committed to nonviolence, and I believe with all my heart that for the civil rights movement to prove itself, its nonviolent actions had to work in Birmingham,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Birmingham, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Selma march, there wouldn\u2019t have been a 1965 civil rights bill. Birmingham was the birthplace and affirmation of the nonviolent movement in America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker helped circulate \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important documents of the civil rights movement, in which Dr. King argued for civil disobedience as a legitimate response to racial segregation. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nImage In April 1970, Dr. Walker preached a Sunday sermon through a bullhorn outside Teen City, a Harlem pizza parlor that was notorious as a drug-trafficking den. \u201cWe are trying to save our children,\u201d he said, then turned his bullhorn toward tenements across the street. \u201cYou, up there in the windows,\u201d he said, \"tell your kids to keep out of Teen City.\u201d Credit Michael Evans/The New York Times\n\nScholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.\n\nA March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\nAfrican American Legends: Rev. Wyatt T. Walker on the Civil Rights Movement Credit Video by cunytv75\n\n\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201d\n\nWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.\n\nWhen Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.\n\nBut the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he used cardboard to cover holes in the soles of his shoes. Five siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.\n\nImage Dr. Walker in 1998.

He also held a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester. (The Crozer seminary in Pennsylvania had merged with Colgate Rochester in 1970.)\n\nAn authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. His photography was also the subject of exhibits.\n\nOrdained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.\n\nIn Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nDr. Walker worked for the S.C.L.C. in Atlanta for four years before moving to Harlem, in 1965, when he was named pulpit minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church.\n\nTwo years later, he became pastor and chief executive of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, a post he held until a series of strokes forced him to retire in 2004. He then moved to Virginia to be closer to relatives.\n\nThe Official Tony Brown's Journal -- Rev. Wyatt T Walker Credit Video by Tony Brown\n\nDr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.\n\nDuring his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.\n\nIn 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.\n\nFor Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations. It was tough to frighten me, because I was so convinced that God would take care of me.\u201d\n\nCorrection : An earlier version of this obituary misstated the location of Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, where Dr. Walker was the pastor for many years. It is at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue in Harlem \u2014 not at 115th Street between St. Nicholas and Lenox Avenues. William McDonald and Daniel E.

Although I am a conservative professor, I recommend making a concession to it by explicitly assigning writers of different races and social backgrounds. Let me explain.\n\nWhen I was in college, I took a class in logic. There I learned that one should never reject an argument because of the characteristics of the person making it. Instead, one should assess the argument itself on its rational merits. And while I agree that the power of an argument should not depend on the person making it, nonetheless, it does.\n\nI learned that lesson during my first year as a visiting professor at Cornell University. I taught a course on American evangelicals, which attracted a mix of secular and religious students. When we discussed \u201cThe Scandal of the Evangelical Mind,\u201d a 1994 book by Mark A. Noll about anti-intellectualism in the evangelical tradition, my evangelical students were critical of it. But they were willing to take the book\u2019s thesis seriously because the author was an evangelical.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Noll\u2019s identity shouldn\u2019t have mattered. His historical evidence and the power of his arguments would be worth considering even if he were Catholic, Jewish or secular. But his identity did matter. It mattered because my evangelical students could not simply assume bad faith on the author\u2019s part. They knew Mr. Noll cared about evangelicals as a group of people. Instead of dismissing Mr. Noll as a bigot, my students thoughtfully engaged with his work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I currently teach a course called Black Intellectuals, which is focused on debates around racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. It tends to attract progressive students who, in analyzing racial inequality, are drawn to arguments that stress structural obstacles to equality and the enduring power of white racism, especially in our criminal justice system. The course features black authors who do defend that view, but I also teach the work of others who depart from it in some measure, including heterodox thinkers like Thomas Chatterton Williams and conservatives like Jason Riley. Much like my conservative evangelical students at Cornell, my progressive students at Claremont McKenna College are less likely to assume these contrarian black thinkers are acting in bad faith or are motivated by bigotry \u2014 even when the thinkers criticize hip-hop culture or defend white police officers. So the students engage the challenging arguments and ideas instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs conservatives have long observed and psychologists have since confirmed, human beings are hive-minded animals whose moral judgments are shaped more by sentiments than by reason. Thus, when we are confronted by arguments we disagree with, we can easily find reasons to reject them. The search for disconfirming evidence, however, can sometimes be short-circuited, especially when we feel close to the person making an argument we disagree with. As the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt concluded in his 2012 book, \u201cThe Righteous Mind,\u201d if we have \u201caffection, admiration, or desire to please\u201d other people, we lean toward them and attempt to \u201cfind the truth\u201d in their arguments.

Beginning with the Chinese, migrants from Asia were the early targets; beginning in 1917, an \u201cAsiatic Barred Zone\u201d (with latitude and longitude markers laid out clearly in the legislative code) kept out migrants from an imaginary mega-region that stretched from contemporary Turkey to Papua New Guinea.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, a new \u201cnational origins\u201d quota system sought to turn back the American demographic clock, with European immigrants admitted in proportion to the presence of their \u201cnationality\u201d in the American population based on earlier censuses.

American law did not allow Asians to obtain citizenship until 1952.\n\nUnder the pressure of anti-racist and immigrant rights pressure, the system fell in 1965 with the passage of the Hart-Celler Act, which foregrounded family reunification, refugee admissions and the entry of the highly skilled and educated. But racism persisted in both policy enforcement and popular attitudes.\n\nNew caps on Western Hemisphere migration \u2014 flying in the face of United States demand for workers, an entrenched labor migration industry and poverty and repression in Latin America that forced thousands into exile \u2014 outlawed decades-old migration flows. In the 1990s new nativist movements directed against Latin Americans arose, as well as efforts to eliminate migrants\u2019 rights to basic services and the expansion of immigrant incarceration and mass deportation. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the principle that immigrants from Muslim-majority countries required special scrutiny and restriction was central to the remaking of immigration policy in the name of national security.\n\nThe prevailing questions we\u2019re conditioned to ask about immigrants have all been deeply shaped by histories of racial restriction.

But in this defensive posture of response, which inadvertently legitimates the questions it answers, one can also feel the overwhelming presence of racist suspicion and hostility roaring out of the past into our time.\n\nWe will not, ultimately, succeed in deposing Mr. Trump\u2019s hateful, racist approach toward immigrants unless we refuse not only his nastiest word choices, but also the underlying questions he and others insist we ask.\n\nWe can choose to ask different questions: To what extent are the countries of the global north implicated in forces that prevent people in the global south from surviving and thriving where they are? In what ways do restrictive immigration policies heighten the exploitation of workers? How does the fear of deportation make migrant workers easier to discipline, hurt and rob? In what ways does mass migration from the poorer parts of the earth to centers of wealth and power reflect the larger problem of global inequality?\n\nElites in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 long before Donald Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 have long known they could sustain their power by capitalizing on, deepening and, where necessary, inventing divisions between self and other, friend and enemy. This political strategy, with troubling successes to its name, has been updated and rescaled for our globalized age, in which the fault lines are those of bordered nationality: There will be no protection offered from polluters or health insurance companies, but the threat of Muslims and Mexicans will be met.\n\nTo the white nationalists\u2019 war cry against migrants, \u201cYou will not replace us,\u201d we can and should reply, as have many before, \u201cYou will not divide us.\u201d", "keywords": ["law", "migrants", "racism", "questions", "immigrants", "represents", "united", "antiimmigrant", "american", "world", "tradition", "trumps", "migration", "immigration", "states", "war"], "polarity": 0.09306234890650474, "subjectivity": 0.3713653229886996}
