Credit Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a week, the White House has shifted its story about how and when members of the Trump administration learned about the domestic abuse allegations that forced Rob Porter, one of President Trump\u2019s top aides, to resign.\n\nOn Tuesday, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, contradicted the latest White House timeline, disclosing that the bureau informed the White House on three separate occasions about the status of the background check into Mr. Porter.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later offered a new timeline, blaming career employees in the White House security office for failing to inform senior West Wing aides of the accusations against Mr. Porter.\n\n2003-2008\n\nMarriage to Colbie Holderness\n\n2003\n\nMr. Porter married Colbie Holderness weeks after the couple graduated from Harvard University and Wellesley College. She later told The Intercept that while on their honeymoon in the Canary Islands, Mr. Porter kicked her during an argument.\n\n2005\n\nWhile on vacation in Florence, Ms. Holderness took a photograph of herself with a black eye, which she said was taken shortly after Mr. Porter punched her. After the photos were published in The Intercept, Mr. Porter said in a statement that the images were misleading. \u201cI took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago, and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described,\u201d he said.\n\n2008\n\nMr. Porter and Ms. Holderness divorced.\n\n2009-2013\n\nMarriage to Jennifer Willoughby\n\nNov. 26, 2009\n\nMr. Porter married Jennifer Willoughby. During their honeymoon, Ms. Willoughby said, Mr. Porter frequently became angry and yelled expletives at her.\n\nJune 19, 2010\n\nMs. Willoughby filed a protective order against Mr. Porter in an Arlington County, Va., court after saying that he violated their separation agreement, came to their apartment and punched the glass in the door to their home.\n\nNovember 2013\n\nMr. Porter and Ms. Willoughby divorced.\n\nDecember 2016\n\nA woman dating Mr. Porter at the time reached out to Ms. Willoughby and Ms. Holderness, detailing abuse and seeking advice on how to leave him.\n\n\u201cI work in politics, and despite Rob\u2019s repeated abuse, some of which I think many know about, he continues to rise and I\u2019m afraid to go against him,\u201d the woman wrote to Ms. Holderness, according to Facebook messages. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you. I wanted to reach out and hear your story if you are willing to share \u2014 as well as how you broke out of it with him and mostly, how you recovered.\u201d\n\n2017\n\nThe Background Investigation Begins\n\nJanuary\n\nOn Jan. 20, Mr. Porter became White House staff secretary and assistant to the president for policy coordination. He was responsible for paper flow to the president and was later involved in drafting President Trump\u2019s inaugural State of the Union address.\n\nMr. Porter told Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, that he was concerned about his former wives coming forward with potentially damaging accusations.\n\nDespite that conversation, the White House granted Mr. Porter an interim security clearance to handle highly classified materials going to the president.\n\nF.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Holderness and Ms. Willoughby as part of an investigation for Mr. Porter\u2019s security clearance in the White House, and both women discussed the domestic abuse allegations. In January, Ms. Willoughby said, Mr. Porter sent a mutual friend to speak to her husband, Skiffington Holderness, about the interview.\n\nMarch\n\nThe F.B.I. delivered to the White House a partial report on problems in Mr. Porter\u2019s background, Mr. Wray told senators Tuesday. Mr. Wray did not detail what was in the report or specify who at the White House received that information.\n\nIn its initial explanations of the timeline, the White House did not disclose receiving information from the F.B.I. in March.\n\nImage Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, contradicted the White House timeline in testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Credit Lawrence Jackson for The New York Times\n\nOn Tuesday, after Mr. Wray\u2019s testimony, two people briefed on the situation said the information delivered to the White House in March was only basic employment information, not allegations of abuse.\n\nMs. Sanders said on Tuesday that information from the F.B.I. would have been received by the White House personnel security office. She said she was not aware that anyone at the security office disclosed in March to any official in the West Wing that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background check.\n\nApril 24\n\nMs. Willoughby published a blog post titled \u201cWhy I Stayed,\u201d in which she described an abusive marriage with Mr. Porter, but did not name him. She said Mr. Porter later called her multiple times to demand that she remove the post.\n\nSummer 2017\n\nThe F.B.I. Delivers Its Assessment\n\nJuly\n\nMr. Wray testified on Tuesday that the F.B.I. gave the White House \u201ca completed background investigation\u201d in late July. Mr. Wray again declined to say who at the White House the F.B.I. communicated with when they delivered the completed background investigation.\n\nMr. Wray said that \u201csoon thereafter\u201d the bureau received a request for a \u201cfollow-up inquiry\u201d about Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation. Mr. Wray did not disclose what the follow-up inquiry was, or who made it.\n\nPeople briefed on the situation said officials at the security office encouraged the F.B.I. to interview Mr. Porter before closing its background investigation.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that she was not aware that anyone in the White House security office contacted any senior official in the West Wing about Mr. Porter\u2019s background check issues in July.\n\nHowever, people briefed on the issue said Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation. The White House disputed that assertion, saying that Mr. McGahn was unaware of any problem.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the security office believed that the F.B.I. report in July \u201crequired significant additional investigatory fieldwork\u201d before security officials could decide whether to recommend a security clearance for Mr. Porter. They asked the F.B.I. to do more work on it, she said.\n\nSeptember\n\nAccording to Ms. Willoughby, White House officials informed Mr. Porter that his security clearance \u201chad not gone through,\u201d as she recalled him saying. She said he told her that \u201csomeone had told him that there was a violent allegation and that was what was holding it up.\u201d An F.B.I. agent emailed Ms. Willoughby, asking for permission to gain access to the 2010 restraining order, writing, \u201cin furtherance of the background investigation.\u201d\n\nFall 2017\n\nSecurity Office Begins Evaluating Porter\n\nNovember\n\nThe F.B.I. delivered to the White House the results of the requested \u201cfollow-up\u201d to Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, according to Mr. Wray.\n\nTwo people briefed on the matter said that by November, Mr. Porter had been interviewed by the F.B.I.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the security office received from the F.B.I. in November what it considered to be the \u201cfinal background investigation report\u201d and began evaluating Mr. Porter\u2019s request for a security clearance.\n\nWhite House officials and people briefed on the case said the F.B.I. delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was unlikely to succeed in receiving a permanent clearance. They said security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final decision on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nMs. Sanders said she was not aware that anyone in the security office communicated in November to any senior official in the West Wing about problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nBut multiple people familiar with the situation have said top officials \u2014 including Mr. McGahn; John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; and Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff \u2014 learned in November that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nImage Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press\n\nOne person briefed on the situation, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, disputes that, saying that Mr. McGahn did not learn of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office in November.\n\nBut people close to Mr. McGahn said that a woman who had been dating Mr. Porter for some time came to Mr. McGahn in mid-November to complain about Mr. Porter. The woman, who knew Mr. McGahn well, was upset because she had discovered that Mr. Porter was also dating Hope Hicks, the White House communications director. The people briefed on the conversation said the woman did not claim physical abuse, but told Mr. McGahn that he should not trust Mr. Porter.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nMr. Porter\u2019s background check investigation was \u201cadministratively closed,\u201d Mr. Wray said during his testimony Tuesday, weeks before the allegations become public. The bureau \u201creceived some additional information\u201d after the file was closed, he said, and passed that on to the White House as well.\n\nMr. Wray said he was \u201cquite confident\u201d that established protocol was followed.\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nA Public Accounting\n\nFeb. 6\n\nAllegations of physical abuse from Ms. Holderness and Ms. Willoughby, Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives, were published in The Daily Mail. Ms. Hicks worked with other White House officials to draft statements supporting Mr. Porter.\n\nThose statements included one from Mr. Kelly, who described Mr. Porter \u201ca man of true integrity and honor.\u201d\n\nImage John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, at a press briefing in October. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who once employed Mr. Porter as chief of staff, said in a statement that \u201cthe country needs more honest, principled people like Rob Porter, which is why I hope that this cynical campaign to discredit his character ultimately fails.\u201d\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the White House security office was still evaluating the results of Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, and had not yet come to a conclusion when the allegations against Mr. Porter were published.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nMr. Porter, despite the support from senior White House officials, announced his resignation. In a statement, he said that \u201cthese allegations are simply false,\u201d even as more details and photos said to be a result of the abuse circulated in a new interview published in The Intercept.\n\nMs. Sanders also issued a statement saying that both the president and Mr. Kelly had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Mr. Porter\u2019s performance. Mr. Kelly released a new statement later that day, around 10 p.m., saying he had been unaware of the allegations against Mr. Porter.\n\nMr. Hatch, for his part, described himself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the new allegations.\n\nFeb. 8\n\nWhite House officials conceded regrets about how they handled the accusations against Mr. Porter. At a news briefing, Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Kelly had not been aware of the allegations, and that the security clearance investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background had been continuing until his resignation.\n\n\u201cHis background investigation was ongoing,\u201d Mr. Shah told reporters. \u201cHe was operating on an interim security clearance. His clearance was never denied, and he resigned.\u201d\n\nImage Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, was asked on Thursday about the allegations against Mr. Porter. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nMr. Kelly told staff members that he had learned the details of Mr. Porter\u2019s situation only \u201c40 minutes before he threw him out\u201d two days earlier. In a memo sent that night, Mr. Kelly wrote: \u201cWhile we are all processing the shocking and troubling allegations made against a former White House staffer, I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence very seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nFeb. 9\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged the accusations facing Mr. Porter, saying that it was a \u201ctough time\u201d for his former aide. The president added, \u201cHe also, as you probably know, says he is innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d Mr. Kelly also told White House officials that he was willing to step down over his handling of the allegations.\n\nThat evening, the White House announced that Derek Lyons, another lawyer educated at Harvard Law School and Mr. Porter\u2019s No. 2, had been elevated to acting staff secretary.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nA day after Mr. Trump complained that a \u201cmere allegation\u201d could ruin someone without due process, White House aides fanned out to talk shows to say that Mr. Porter had lied to them and deserved to be pushed out.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nWhile testifying in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, contradicted the White House timeline and confirmed for the first time that the bureau had given the White House a partial report on problems in Mr. Porter\u2019s background in March. He also said the bureau had closed its investigation in January, though the White House had insisted that it was still continuing well into February.\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.\n\nMichael D.

The senator has avoided any criticism of Mr. Trump in recent weeks and on Monday met with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s political advisers, getting wind of the meeting, scrambled to brief Ms. Trump and her own staff about Mr. Corker\u2019s renewed interest in running again and his desire for the president\u2019s support, according to a Republican official. An aide to Mr. Corker said Ms. Trump requested the meeting.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. Corker\u2019s advisers say he and Mr. Trump have patched up their relationship and the senator is simply hearing out those who would like him to remain in the Senate, a decision he technically does not have to make until Tennessee\u2019s filing deadline in early April.\n\n\u201cIn recent days, people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda,\u201d said Micah Johnson, Mr. Corker\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Corker is not the only Republican who could shake up a closely watched Senate race.

That would raise a delicate issue for a Senate Republican caucus that includes just five women in its ranks.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can\u2019t win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Ms. Blackburn, adding, \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about these ego-driven, tired old men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is an unmistakable reference to a bloc of establishment-aligned Tennessee Republicans who believe Ms. Blackburn\u2019s conservative politics and hard-charging style may turn off some voters and make her vulnerable against the centrist and low-key Mr. Bredesen.\n\nTom Ingram, a Republican strategist and a longtime friend of Mr. Corker\u2019s, argued that Republicans could imperil the seat and their one-seat majority if they do not rally around an incumbent who has already won the state twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dicey race with an unproven statewide candidate against Phil Bredesen,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cIf Corker is the nominee, it\u2019s not in play.\u201d\n\nFueling the anxieties of some Tennessee Republicans is the openness some in the party\u2019s donor wing have toward backing Mr. Bredesen.

But Mr. Schumer objected, on the grounds that such a measure is unrelated to DACA. Without the Democratic leader\u2019s consent, debate cannot begin until midnight Tuesday, or very early Wednesday morning. Republicans were left fuming in frustration.\n\n\u201cThis is the debate they said they wanted,\u201d Mr. McConnell, sounding irked, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI said we\u2019d have an open and fair process.

Credit Brynn Anderson/Associated Press\n\nHow easy is it to change people\u2019s votes in an election?\n\nThe answer, a growing number of studies conclude, is that most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all.\n\nThis conclusion may sound jarring at a time when people are concerned about the effects of the false news articles that flooded Facebook and other online outlets during the 2016 election. Observers speculated that these so-called fake news articles swung the election to Donald J. Trump. Similar suggestions of large persuasion effects, supposedly pushing Mr. Trump to victory, have been made about online advertising from the firm Cambridge Analytica and content promoted by Russian bots.\n\nMuch more remains to be learned about the effects of these types of online activities, but people should not assume they had huge effects. Previous studies have found, for instance, that the effects of even television advertising (arguably a higher-impact medium) are very small. According to one credible estimate, the net effect of exposure to an additional ad shifts the partisan vote of approximately two people out of 10,000.\n\nIn fact, a recent meta-analysis of numerous different forms of campaign persuasion, including in-person canvassing and mail, finds that their average effect in general elections is zero.\n\nField experiments testing the effects of online ads on political candidates and issues have also found null effects. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised \u2014 it\u2019s hard to change people\u2019s minds! Their votes are shaped by fundamental factors like which party they typically support and how they view the state of the economy. \u201cFake news\u201d and bots are likely to have vastly smaller effects, especially given how polarized our politics have become.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should look for in evaluating claims about vast persuasion effects from dubious online content:\n\nHow many people actually saw the questionable material. Many alarming statistics have been produced since the election about how many times \u201cfake news\u201d was shared on Facebook or how many times Russian bots retweeted content on Twitter. These statistics obscure the fact that the content being shared may not reach many Americans (most people are not on Twitter and consume relatively little political news) or even many humans (many bot followers may themselves be bots).\n\nWhether the people being exposed are persuadable. Dubious political content online is disproportionately likely to reach heavy news consumers who already have strong opinions. For instance, a study I conducted with Andrew Guess of Princeton and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter in Britain showed that exposure to fake news websites before the 2016 election was heavily concentrated among the 10 percent of Americans with the most conservative information diets \u2014 not exactly swing voters.\n\nThe proportion of news people saw that is bogus. The total number of shares or likes that fake news and bots attract can sound enormous until you consider how much information circulates online. Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election \u2014 certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.\n\nSimilarly, my study with Mr. Guess and Mr. Reifler found that the mean number of articles on fake news websites visited by Trump supporters was 13.1, but only 40 percent of his supporters visited such websites, and they represented only about 6 percent of the pages they visited on sites focusing on news topics.\n\nNone of these findings indicate that fake news and bots aren\u2019t worrisome signs for American democracy. They can mislead and polarize citizens, undermine trust in the media, and distort the content of public debate. But those who want to combat online misinformation should take steps based on evidence and data, not hype or speculation.\n\nBrendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College.

As of now, there are no plans to cancel or further delay joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea, scheduled for after the Olympic Games.\n\nStill, the tactical shift by the White House opens the door to an unpredictable new phase in the crisis over North Korea. It also shows how the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been able to use the Olympics to pursue a thaw with a receptive counterpart in the South.\n\nPresident Trump himself has oscillated between a get-tough approach and a deal maker\u2019s belief that he can sit down with Mr. Kim and work out an agreement. Some of his advisers, like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, favor engagement; others, like the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have pushed for more pressure, backed by the threat of military action.\n\nReports that Washington and Seoul had reached an understanding on the possibility of dialogue appeared in the news media after the vice president\u2019s departure on Saturday, but South Korean officials would not confirm them until Tuesday.\n\nDialogue with the North has been used by successive American administrations as a carrot \u2014 paired with the stick of sanctions \u2014 in the hopes of getting the isolated nation to end its nuclear weapons program. But the Trump administration has long resisted that approach, saying it would not be drawn into a negotiation like that of the Clinton administration in 1994, which resulted in a deal North Korea later broke.\n\nJust six months ago, Mr. Trump described Mr. Moon\u2019s overtures to the North as \u201cappeasement.\u201d When Mr. Tillerson said in December that the United States was willing to hold a \u201cmeeting without precondition,\u201d the White House dismissed his comments as premature.\n\nBut in an interview with The Washington Post after he left South Korea, Mr. Pence suggested that the United States was open to a meeting, even indicating that it would enter talks without preconditions. \u201cThe maximum pressure campaign is going to continue and intensify,\u201d Mr. Pence said of the punishing sanctions imposed on the North by the United Nations. \u201cBut if you want to talk, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nAgreeing to talks before the North Koreans have demonstrated a willingness to dismantle their weapons program would be a subtle but potentially significant shift in Washington\u2019s approach \u2014 and a win for Mr. Moon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Pence and Mr. Moon met last week, the allies apparently found common ground: They would agree to talks without set rules, but they would continue to use sanctions as leverage.\n\n\u201cPresident Moon and I reflected last night on the need to do something fundamentally different,\u201d Mr. Pence told reporters on Friday after meeting with the South Korean leader.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She extended an invitation from her brother to Mr. Moon for a summit meeting in North Korea.\n\nMr. Moon, who invited athletes from the North to participate in the Olympics \u2014 where they marched with South Korean athletes under a unified Korean flag during the opening ceremony \u2014 has seen the Games as an important step toward promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDeciphering the Trump administration\u2019s signals on North Korea is tricky, given the president\u2019s unpredictability. Mr. Trump has repeatedly contradicted Mr. Tillerson when he has floated diplomatic openings. But Mr. Pence, officials point out, received his marching orders from Mr. Trump shortly before he left for Asia, and he was unlikely to deviate from them.\n\nThe White House has been relieved by the lull in North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, even as it has watched the emerging d\u00e9tente warily.

Analysts predicted that North Korea would use any future talks with Washington to be accepted as a nuclear power and win large economic concessions, in return for agreeing not to advance its nuclear weapons program any further.\n\nNorth Korea has said that it would not bargain away its weapons, and would only discuss mutual arms reduction \u2014 a vow that American intelligence agencies take seriously. The C.I.A. has assessed that no amount of pressure will lead Mr. Kim to give up his arsenal.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, said, North Korea \u201chas repeatedly stated that it does not intend to negotiate its nuclear weapons and missiles away because the regime views nuclear weapons are critical to its security.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim, he added, \u201cprobably sees nuclear ICBMs as leverage to achieve his long-term strategic ambition to end Seoul\u2019s alliance with Washington and to eventually dominate the peninsula.\u201d", "keywords": ["trump", "administration", "pence", "weapons", "talks", "korea", "preliminary", "north", "mr", "united", "korean", "nuclear", "south", "willing"], "polarity": 0.06763167388167388, "subjectivity": 0.39230171169826333},

Of 12 positions deemed most central to the president, only five are still filled by the same person as when Mr. Trump took office.\n\nMr. Trump is on his second press secretary, his second national security adviser and his third deputy national security adviser. Five different people have been named communications director or served in the job in an acting capacity. The president has parted ways with his chief strategist, health secretary, several deputy chiefs of staff and his original private legal team. He is on his second chief of staff \u2014 and some wonder whether a third may be in the offing soon.\n\nSome administration officials privately spend much of their time trying to figure out how to leave without looking disloyal or provoking an easily angered president. Others, like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, stubbornly resist what seem like clear signals that they are no longer welcome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told Fox News last week, months after the White House was reported in The New York Times and elsewhere to have a plan to replace him. \u201cNothing has changed.\u201d Asked if he thought some in the administration were still advocating that he be replaced, Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\nGrueling in the best of times, an administration job now seems even less appealing to many potential recruits. Republican operatives said they worry not only about the pressure-cooker, soap-opera atmosphere and the danger of being drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russia\u2019s election interference but also about hurting their careers after the White House.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a huge appetite from many Republicans on the outside to explore job opportunities in this administration,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a former spokesman for Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee. \u201cWhile there are a lot of vacancies and usually a position in the White House is one of the most prestigious jobs in Washington, that\u2019s just not the feeling with this administration, given the turmoil and the chaos.\u201d\n\nJohn F. Kelly was charged with reining in the turmoil and the chaos when he took over as chief of staff last summer, and many credit him with imposing more order on the building and shuffling out some of the more quarrelsome figures. But many White House officials were already souring on Mr. Kelly even before his handling of the abuse allegations against Mr. Porter gave his internal critics new ammunition against him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has expressed frustration with Mr. Kelly as well, but has sent mixed signals about whether he might replace him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former contestant on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who worked in the White House until Mr. Kelly pushed her out in December, cried as she described her experiences during a new episode of \u201cThe Celebrity Big Brother\u201d that aired on CBS last week.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m there fighting, fighting, fighting, getting my head bashed in, and nobody coming out publicly to say, \u2018We support her,\u2019\u201d she told a fellow competitor.

It\u2019s not.\u201d She added that she would not vote for Mr. Trump again \u201cin a million years, never.\u201d\n\nBeyond those leaving, many positions have never been filled nearly 13 months after the inauguration. Some of those vacancies stem from the glacial pace of background investigations and the Senate confirmation process, which has grown worse with each successive president. But in many cases, the Trump administration has still not identified candidates.\n\nAccording to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that tracks appointments along with The Washington Post, the Trump administration has made the fewest nominations, not counting those that have failed, and has had the fewest confirmed by this point of any of the last five administrations. At the State Department, nominees have yet to be made for three under secretary positions and 10 assistant secretary positions, senior-level jobs that have traditionally been crucial to managing foreign policy.\n\nNow in its second year, the president\u2019s team is trying to get ahead of the situation. The White House on Friday released a raft of appointments. But a vast majority of the 32 announced were actually just promotions from within, or additional titles for existing staff members.\n\nThe top two appointments on the list were James Carroll as acting national drug policy director and John DeStefano as counselor to the president, both choices that underlined the challenges for the White House.\n\nFor Mr. Carroll, it will be his fourth job in the White House since the administration\u2019s inception; he started in the White House counsel\u2019s office, then became general counsel for the budget office and served most recently as deputy chief of staff. For Mr. DeStefano, the new title was a recognition that he has already effectively been overseeing the offices of personnel, political affairs and public liaison.\n\nThe constant churning exacts a toll. \u201cIt takes time for any group to jell and learn the ropes of governing, and that is definitely complicated by turnover,\u201d said Lisa Brown, a top White House official under Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. \u201cEvery new person has to learn the ropes and changes the team dynamic.

Credit Andrew Cullen/Reuters\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday moved to repeal one of the last unchallenged climate-change regulations rushed into place in the waning days of the Obama presidency \u2014 a rule restricting the release of planet-warming methane into the atmosphere.\n\nThe rule, which applied to companies drilling for energy on federal land, has been the subject of intense court battles and delay efforts, as well as one surprise vote last year in which Senate Republicans temporarily saved it from being torpedoed.\n\nMethane, which is about 25 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, accounts for 9 percent of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions; about a third of that is estimated to come from oil and gas operations. Under the rule, oil and gas companies would have been required to capture leaked methane, update their equipment and write new plans for minimizing waste when drilling on government property.\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management described the rule as costly, redundant and overly burdensome.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve energy dominance through responsible energy production, we need smart regulations, not punitive regulations,\u201d Joe Balash, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said Monday in a statement .\n\nThe move came as the Trump administration released an $11.3 billion budget for the Interior Department that emphasized the development of domestic energy resources and \u201cresponsible development of energy on public lands and offshore waters.\u201d\n\nThe methane waste rule was aimed at accidental gas leaks and the process of venting and burning off leaked gas, known as flaring, from oil and gas wells on public lands. It was created as part of a broad strategy to tackle climate change as well as wasteful releases of gas. The Bureau of Land Management estimated in 2016 that the rule would prevent as much as 180,000 tons of methane emissions annually, about the equivalent of taking 950,000 cars off the road.\n\nThe oil and gas industry argued that the rule could cost as much as $279 million to implement and would hinder production. The industry made repeal of the regulation a top priority.\n\nAn early effort to revoke the regulation hit a snag in May when Senators John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, all Republicans, voted against a Senate resolution that would have eliminated it. The lawmakers said they were concerned that the resolution would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.\n\nThe Interior Department then twice tried to suspend the regulation, an effort that is still being challenged in court.\n\nWestern lawmakers on Monday cheered the repeal, saying the rule would have discouraged energy production and job growth. \u201cThe previous administration scorned domestic energy development and crafted the prior rule to deliberately stifle it,\u201d said Representative Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources. He called the repeal \u201ca necessary step.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental activists denounced the plan and noted that the repeal would return the Bureau of Land Management to a set of policies dealing with methane waste that are almost 40 years old. \u201cGutting the rule would allow unchecked waste of natural gas, unnecessary pollution and the loss of revenue to communities and tribes to address critical needs such as schools and roads,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nThe agency is expected to publish the proposal in the Federal Register, which will kick off a 60-day public comment period. A final repeal of the rule would come after that.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nBrian Riedl in National Review:\n\n\n\n\u201cRepublican lawmakers have spent years promising deficit reduction, spending restraint, and entitlement reform. Despite winning full control of Congress and the White House, the cuts have not come.\u201d\n\nAny talk of fiscal responsibility from Republicans, argues Mr. Riedl, is just \u201cempty rhetoric.\u201d He blames his party\u2019s bipartisan deal to raise spending by $300 billion over the next two years on \u201cprecisely the kind of inside-the-Beltway, big-government deal-making\u201d that President Trump was voted in to eliminate. How are we to account for Republicans\u2019 reversing course on the deficit? Part of the reason might have to do with Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The other part, he argues, might have to do with the party\u2019s routine \u201cbluff on spending reform.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nNathanael Blake in The Federalist:\n\n\u201cThis is a moral problem.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that politicians like to ascribe to the moral failings of their ideological counterparts. For some reason, Mr. Blake points out, adding to the national debt is not one of these things. As he explains, the national debt \u201csteals from other people\u2019s futures in a way that mere personal debt does not.\u201d The real solution to the problem, he says, is a tough one for most Americans to swallow. \u201cThe real money,\u201d he writes, \u201cis spent on the military and middle-class welfare programs.\u201d If we\u2019re serious about funding these program, he argues, then we should be willing to drastically cut military spending and raise taxes on the middle class.

After all, he writes, the president already signed a spending bill that raised the government\u2019s budget by $300 billion. This means that the White House\u2019s budget revealed on Monday is \u201ccompletely irrelevant to any real-world decision making.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nMatthew Rozsa in Salon:\n\n\u201cDuring the Obama years, deficit was a four-letter word to the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans used to be deficit averse, Mr. Rozsa reminds his readers.

Samuelson in The Washington Post:\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither party will make the unpopular choices necessary to pay for an aging society and essential government. Ever-larger budget deficits have become their means of making policy and practicing politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost politicians are can kickers,\u201d declares Mr. Samuelson. Politicians of both parties are loath to eliminate popular entitlement programs and military spending, and so far, perhaps they\u2019ve been right. As he points out, this strategy has so far yielded \u201cfew economic or political costs.\u201d But, he argues, even though there have been few negative consequences to a soaring national debt in the past, we should still care about the deficit.

However, Mr. Bernstein notes, in the past, \u201cthe annual document is still normally regarded as a statement of the president\u2019s preferences and priorities.\u201d This time, however, the budget may mean even less to lawmakers in Washington. It contains proposals and policy ideas, Mr. Bernstein argues, \u201cthat Trump has little interest in supporting or fighting for.\u201d Moreover, because the document so clearly reflects the worldview of Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s budget director, and not Mr. Trump, it reveals a rift within the executive branch that we don\u2019t often see. It\u2019s unusual, Mr. Bernstein writes, \u201cfor a president to be so apparently indifferent to whether the executive branch follows where he leads.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\nWant the Partisan Writing Roundup in your inbox?

Another 1.1 million young immigrants are eligible for DACA but did not apply. But Mr. Trump suspended the initiative in September and gave lawmakers until March 5 to come up with a replacement that would protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, after proposed legislation called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM Act.\n\nLiberal interest groups and immigration rights activists have mobilized to insist on legal status for the Dreamers without the concessions demanded by the president and immigration hard-liners: billions for a wall on the Mexican border, an even more aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants and dramatic changes to the legal immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants over the family members of citizens and green-card holders.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate is poised to start debate on the humanitarian crisis Donald Trump caused when he cruelly ended DACA, here\u2019s what every sitting Senator should remember: Americans want the Dream Act \u2014 not cruel deals that go against basic American values,\u201d said Corinne Ball, campaign director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group.\n\nConservatives and anti-immigration groups are just as vociferous.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obama who created a cruel situation by making promises to a group of illegal aliens who he had no authority to promise what he gave them,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limiting immigration. \u201cPresident Trump had a duty to rescind that policy, because the Constitution makes very clear that Congress, not the White House, sets the laws in this land.\u201d\n\nIn such a polarized environment, there is a significant chance that the Senate will pass nothing by the end of the week \u2014 or that whatever measure the Senate does adopt will be thwarted by the House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have something in the Senate that we haven\u2019t had in a while,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real debate on an issue where we really don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nImmigration is one of the most emotional, contentious issues in Washington.

A number of Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have drafted legislation that mirrors the White House plan, which will almost certainly be introduced as an amendment.

A bipartisan group calling itself the Common Sense Coalition, led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, has been working on its own measure but has not released a plan.\n\nThat group is focused on a narrower bill than the president would like, one that would pair a path to citizenship for the Dreamers with funding for the border wall.\n\n\u201cThe only way to achieve a solution to the DACA crisis is to keep it simple,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the coalition, said on the Senate floor Monday.\n\nBut Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, said he could not support a bill that addresses only DACA and border security. \u201cThe president\u2019s indicated he would not sign such a bill, so that really doesn\u2019t meet my definition of success,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, the idea of an open-ended debate is so novel that many newer senators say they have never experienced one, and are scurrying to learn the rules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor a lot of us, we\u2019re going to have to learn this process,\u201d said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who was elected in 2014.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, marveled, \u201cBeen here seven years \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights groups are nervous, and do not know quite what to expect.

{"title": "\n                    Here Are the Places That Struggle to Meet the Rules on Safe Drinking Water                 ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/climate/drinking-water-safety.html", "text": "Here Are the Places That Struggle to Meet the Rules on Safe Drinking Water\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 To ensure that tap water in the United States is safe to drink, the federal government has been steadily tightening the health standards for the nation\u2019s water supplies for decades. But over and over again, local water systems around the country have failed to meet these requirements.\n\nIn a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that, since 1982, between 3 and 10 percent of the country\u2019s water systems have been in violation of federal Safe Drinking Water Act health standards each year. In 2015 alone, as many as 21 million Americans may have been exposed to unsafe drinking water.\n\nThe problem is particularly severe in low-income rural areas, the study found. And the researchers identified several places, including Oklahoma and West Texas, that have repeatedly fallen short in complying with water safety rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency over the past decade.\n\n\u201cThese are often smaller communities flying under the radar,\u201d said Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of California, Irvine, and a lead author of the study. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to maintain their aging infrastructure, and they\u2019re struggling to keep up with the latest water treatment techniques.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the safety of America\u2019s tap water gained national prominence after the 2015 crisis in Flint, Mich., when residents discovered dangerously high levels of lead in their drinking water. Since then, a barrage of reports have revealed that a surprisingly large number of local water systems serving millions of Americans sometimes contain unsafe levels of contaminants like lead, nitrates, arsenic or pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nIn many cases, it can be unclear whether such contamination is isolated or evidence of a deeper systemic problem at a water utility.\n\nTo address that issue in this newest study, Dr. Allaire and her co-authors looked for patterns in health-based violations over time at 17,900 local water systems around the United States between 1982 and 2015. She said one question guiding the research was \u201cWhat kind of factors make some water utilities more susceptible than others?\u201d\n\nOne striking finding: Health violations for drinking water surged in rural areas in the 2000s after the E.P.A. enacted regulations focused on disinfectants. Utilities have long used chlorine or other chemicals to disinfect their drinking water supplies. But this process has a troubling side effect. Those chemicals can react with organic matter in the water to create new compounds that may pose their own health risks.\n\nIn recent years, the E.P.A. has required water utilities to limit these disinfectant byproducts, though doing so can be costly and technically challenging. That often poses difficulties for rural water utilities with smaller customer bases and fewer financial resources.\n\n\u201cMany of these smaller utilities have just a handful of people who are charged with managing the entire system,\u201d said Manuel P. Teodoro, a political scientist at Texas A&M University who has studied the challenges facing small and rural water utilities.\n\nHe noted that this research suggests one possible strategy for improving water quality in rural areas: States might provide aid to help smaller water utilities merge and consolidate into larger systems that are better able to comply with complex safety rules. California has been exploring such an approach.\n\nDr. Allaire and her co-authors also found that water systems that serve minority and low-income communities were more likely to violate federal standards around coliform bacteria, which frequently accompany disease-causing pathogens. Their research also showed that privately owned utilities had fewer violations than publicly owned utilities, and that larger water systems tended to have fewer violations than smaller systems.\n\nThe whole point of tracing these patterns, Dr. Allaire said, was to help policymakers understand which parts of the United States might require additional scrutiny or assistance in meeting national water quality standards. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have no systematic way to identify problems and set priorities.\u201d\n\nThis new study may understate the full extent of problems with the nation\u2019s drinking water systems, said Kristi Pullen Fedinick, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that conducted its own nationwide survey of Safe Drinking Water Act violations last year.\n\nState governments are largely responsible for implementing federal water-quality standards, and the quality of monitoring and enforcement can vary significantly. Some states have cut back on budgets for their drinking water programs, and many communities focus on tracking just a handful of key contaminants like coliform or disinfectant byproducts. That means potential violations involving other contaminants, like lead, may go underreported.\n\n\u201cOn a national scale, we know that there\u2019s a huge amount of underreporting,\u201d Dr. Fedinick said.\n\nIn recent years, the E.P.A. and Justice Department have often been reluctant to penalize states or municipalities that fall behind on enforcement or reporting. The federal government can, however, provide technical assistance and funding to water utilities that are struggling with health violations.\n\nScott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A., has expressed interest in modernizing the nation\u2019s water infrastructure, telling Congress this month that he wants to declare a \u201cwar on lead.\u201d He has not yet detailed a plan for doing so, although he has supported increases in funding for an E.P.A. program that can provide low-interest loans for state water projects.\n\nBut environmental groups like Natural Resources Defense Council have viewed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s promises with suspicion, asserting that the Trump administration\u2019s push for sharp budget cuts to other important federal drinking water programs at both the E.P.A. and the Department of Agriculture could end up undercutting water safety.\n\nBrad Plumer is a reporter covering climate change, energy policy and other environmental issues for The Times's climate team. @bradplumer Nadja Popovich is a reporter and graphics editor on the Times's climate team. @popovichN Order Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 10 of the New York edition with the headline: Poor Americans Exposed to Unsafe Water, Study Shows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat on Earth Is Going On?

The Federal Reserve in December projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate at about 2.4 percent.\n\nThere is a similar gap in the projections of long-term growth. If the less optimistic forecasts were correct, the government would collect significantly less revenue. By its own estimates, the result would be another $3 trillion in federal debt.\n\nThe administration attributed the difference to the expectation that the president\u2019s policies would significantly increase productivity growth.\n\nJason Furman, the former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, calculated that productivity growth would have to reach the highest level in any decade since the immediate aftermath of the World War II. Productivity growth was 1.1 percent over the last decade; it would have to reach 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to understand where this growth would be coming from,\u201d Mr. Furman tweeted.\n\n\u2014Jim Tankersley\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA 5% Reduction for the Department of Education\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s 2019 budget proposal requests $63.2 billion in discretionary spending at the Education Department, a reduction of $3.6 billion, or 5 percent, from 2017 spending levels.\n\nThe proposal calls for a $1.5 billion \u201cschool choice\u201d program, which includes taxpayer-funded scholarships for private schools and a vast expansion of charter schools. However, the budget would eliminate or cut 39 programs including two staple programs in public schools that provide teacher training and after-school programs to low-income children.\n\nThe Department\u2019s budget also funds initiatives that Mr. Trump has given lip service to in the last year, calling for $43 million in \u201cSchool Climate Transformation\u201d grants to help fight the opioid epidemic in schools, and $200 million in new grants to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics education.\n\n\u2014Erica A. Green\n\nA Hint at the Special Counsel\u2019s Timeline\n\nThe proposal indicates that the work of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, could last another year and a half. It allocates $10 million to his office from October 2018 through the end of September 2019.\n\nBut that does not mean the Russia investigation itself will last that long. The office would also oversee a trial of Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, who has pleaded not guilty to charges he laundered millions of dollars through overseas shell companies. No trial date has been set, but the judge in the case has indicated it would not start before the fall.\n\nDocuments released last year by the special counsel\u2019s office, which is part of the Justice Department, provided a view into its expenses. Those documents showed that between the time the office was opened in May and the end of September it racked up $3.2 million in costs. The largest portion of that money \u2014 $1.7 million \u2014 went to personnel, compensation and benefits. The second highest cost was for the \u201cacquisition of equipment\u201d at $733,969.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s $28 billion proposed budget overall is relatively flat from last year, with notable increases in spending to combat violent crime and drug use as well as house more prisoners. The department wants to increase its immigration enforcement efforts and add 75 immigration judges and support staff. The department counts more than 117,000 employees.\n\nTo offset the spending increases, the Justice Department plans to close two of its six Bureau of Prisons regional administrative offices and two of its seven minimum security prisons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014Katie Benner\n\nTargets Planned Parenthood\n\nThe president\u2019s budget singles out abortion providers and would prohibit Health and Human Services funding, including money used for family planning, from going to any clinic or health care facility that also offers abortion services.\n\nThough the language is broadly written, its intended target is Planned Parenthood, which relies on government funding to offer a variety of services to women other than abortion. The budget would help achieve the longstanding goal of social conservatives to cut off Planned Parenthood from federal assistance.\n\n\u2014Jeremy W. Peters\n\nBig Changes for Food Stamps\n\nThe White House is proposing a significant change for a low-income food program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. The White House proposes to cut funding for the program by about $213 billion \u2014 or 30 percent \u2014 over a decade. It also wants to change how SNAP recipients get their food, replacing a portion of the benefits that allow SNAP recipients to go to a grocery store to purchase food with a package of \u201cnutritious\u201d American-grown food delivered to SNAP households.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The request calls for $18 billion for border security, including $1.6 billion to build about 65 miles of the wall in South Texas. The request also calls for the department to hire 2,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 750 Border Patrol agents.\n\nWhile most of the budget increases focus on illegal immigration and border security, the administration also requested funding to hire 450 new agents for the chronically-short staffed Secret Service, $1 billion for the department\u2019s cybersecurity efforts and $71 million for new scanning technology for the Transportation Security Administration. The new budget request would provide $1.9 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s grant program to state and local communities, $800 million less than the $2.7 billion funded in 2017.\n\n\u2014Ron Nixon\n\nDeep Cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s second federal spending plan proposes steep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, despite Congress\u2019 rejection of a similar plan last year to dramatically shrink the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 budget blueprint would pare the E.P.A. by $2.8 billion or 34 percent from its current level, while eliminating virtually all climate change-related programs. It also would cut the agency\u2019s Office of Science and Technology nearly in half, to $489 million from its current $762 million.\n\nIn outlining the budget, the administration said the E.P.A. is refocusing on what it called \u201ccore activities\u201d and eliminating \u201clower priority programs.\u201d That list includes a program to promote partnerships with the private sector to tackle climate change; environmental education training; and an effort to protect marine estuaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House estimated cutting those programs and others will save taxpayers $600 million compared to 2017 levels.\n\n\u2014Lisa Friedman\n\nAnother Call to Repeal the Affordable Care Act\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes once again to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act and to eliminate the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. More than 30 states have expanded Medicaid under the law. Republican efforts to dismantle the law failed in Congress last year.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said there would be \u201cno cuts\u201d to Medicare or Medicaid if he won the election. But his 2019 budget request is full of proposals to squeeze savings out of the two programs, which together provide health insurance for more than 100 million Americans.\n\nProposed savings in Medicare total more than $490 billion over 10 years, or about 5 percent of Medicare spending expected under current law.\n\nThe budget would cut $69.5 billion over 10 years in projected Medicare payments to hospitals for \u201cuncompensated care.\u201d It would cut more than $95 billion over 10 years from nursing homes and home health agencies, and $22 billion from Medicare Advantage plans, which manage care for about one-third of Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nIn addition, the budget would cut $48 billion over 10 years in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education,\n\nThe budget includes several proposals intended to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries by requiring insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to share at least one-third of the discounts and price concessions they receive from drug manufacturers. The budget would also establish a limit on beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered by Medicare.\n\n\u2014Robert Pear\n\nParing Back a Dodd-Frank Watchdog\n\nThe Treasury Department plan calls for continuing to cut the budget of the Office of Financial Research, which was set up in the wake of the financial crisis to help federal agencies stay ahead of financial risks. The office, which provides analysis and research to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has previously been targeted for both funding and personnel cuts. \u201cThe Budget reflects continued reductions in O.F.R. spending commensurate with the renewed fiscal discipline being applied across the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChanging the Role of the A.T.F.\n\nThe budget would allocate $28 billion to the Justice Department \u2014 a 1.2 percent decrease from the department\u2019s 2017 budget. That budget funds agencies like the F.B.I., the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration. The budget proposal would take tobacco and alcohol enforcement authority away from the A.T.F. and move those authorities to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe D.E.A. would receive an addition $41 million to specifically combat the opioid crisis, and the agency would also take over the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which is currently run by the White House drug czar\u2019s office.\n\n\u2014Ali Watkins\n\nState Department Gets Less Funding\n\nAt the State Department and USAID, the president\u2019s budget proposes a base budget of $25.8 billion, a $9 billion decrease in funding from the 2017 enacted budget. This is a 26 percent decrease in funding, similar to the president\u2019s budgetary intentions last year.\n\nNotably, the president\u2019s new budget aims to shift $12 billion from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to the base budget. The OCO is traditionally used for United States presence in turbulent regions like Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe addendum provides an additional $1 billion to USAID\u2019s International Disaster Assistance account for use in humanitarian crises as well as an additional $400 million for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\n\u2014Emily Baumgaertner", "keywords": ["budget", "billion", "white", "request", "funding", "administration", "federal", "million", "department", "house", "spending", "whats", "cut", "medicare"], "polarity": 0.058881258732449225, "subjectivity": 0.3320675576627956},

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fiction", "obamas", "portrait", "black", "fact", "washington", "wiley", "mr", "politics", "ms", "blend", "sherald", "portraits", "paint", "obama"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, in a letter that the administration \u201cdoes not believe these nondefense spending levels comport with its vision for the proper role and size of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThat law increases military spending by $195 billion over the next two years and nondefense spending by $131 billion over the same period. The White House is proposing $540 billion in nondefense spending for 2019 \u2014 $57 billion below the new spending cap set by Congress.\n\nThe plan contains at least $1.8 trillion in cuts to federal entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps.\n\nThe White House is proposing to cut funding for a low-income food program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, by more than 30 percent over a decade. It would also impose work requirements for \u201cable bodied\u201d recipients of food stamps and change how they get their benefits, replacing a portion of the coupons that allow them to purchase food at a grocery store with a premade box of \u201c100 percent American grown foods provided directly to households.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s budget proposes allowing public housing authorities and property owners to set minimum work requirements for those in public housing as a way to control costs.\n\nMr. Mulvaney, in his letter, said domestic spending at the levels Congress authorized would add too much to the federal deficit.\n\nInstead, he proposed using about $11 billion of the money to scale back the social safety net by changing the way health entitlement programs are paid for. That would essentially mean getting rid of mandatory programs now funded automatically and without congressional approval, and covering the cost with discretionary funds that could be cut or redirected in the future.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe message, Mr. Mulvaney said, was, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend all of this money, Congress, but if you do, here\u2019s how we would prefer to see you spend it.\u201d\n\nYet for all of the talk of fiscal restraint, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget also amounted to an institutional surrender to the free-spending ways of Capitol Hill, which Mr. Mulvaney said had surprised the president and prompted him to refrain from even bothering to advocate deficit reduction.\n\n\u201cI probably could have made it balance,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney, a former anti-deficit absolutist, said ruefully of his plan on Monday, but \u201cit would have taken funny numbers to do it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan could easily result in much larger federal deficits. The administration made its calculations using assumptions about the United States\u2019 economic trajectory that are more optimistic than the consensus among private-sector forecasters, or the assumptions used by other parts of the government.\n\nThe assumptions in Monday\u2019s release are also significantly more optimistic than the Trump administration itself used in its budget calculations last year.\n\nMost notably, the administration projected annualized economic growth of 3.1 percent over the next three years. In December, the Federal Reserve projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate to be about 2.4 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The president says the plan will generate as much as $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion in new investments in building roads, bridges and other major projects over the next 10 years, in large part relying on states, cities and private companies to fund them. But the proposal faces steep challenges in Congress, where many lawmakers believe $200 billion is far too little to create a sustainable stream of federal infrastructure money for the future.\n\n\u201cWe will build, we will maintain, and the vast majority of Americans wants to see us take care of our infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House as he released an outline of the plan and discussed it with cabinet officials, governors and local leaders. \u201cWashington will no longer be a roadblock to progress; Washington will now be your partner.\u201d\n\nStill, the budget compensates for the new infusion of infrastructure spending in part by slashing existing transportation programs, which would be cut by $178 billion over a decade, according to a detailed budget breakdown the Trump administration sent Monday to Capitol Hill. Grants to Amtrak would be halved, from $1.2 trillion to $538 billion, while the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages vast amounts of public infrastructure projects, would see a more than 20 percent cut.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawmakers in both parties, who essentially went around Mr. Trump to strike their own budget compromise, made it clear they had no intention of embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, denounced \u201cdrastic cuts\u201d to the federal crop insurance program, calling them \u201cill advised.\u201d Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said lawmakers in both parties would once again reject the president\u2019s \u201cdeep cuts\u201d to the State Department and foreign aid.\n\nDemocrats dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal on Monday as a far-fetched plan full of misplaced priorities.\n\n\u201cWhile the president and his O.M.B. director live in budget fantasyland, I will be in the real world negotiating a responsible, bipartisan appropriations package that invests in American families and communities,\u201d remarked Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is utterly astounding that just six weeks after slashing taxes on the wealthy and biggest corporations, creating a huge deficit, the president asks older Americans and middle-class Americans to make up the difference by slashing Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security would receive $46 billion, a $3.4 billion increase over this year\u2019s budget, all part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and build a wall on the southern border with Mexico. The request calls for $18 billion for border security, including $1.6 billion to build about 65 miles of the wall in South Texas. The request also calls for the department to hire 2,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 750 Border Patrol agents.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan would also allocate $13 billion in new spending to tackle opioid abuse through prevention, treatment and recovery support services as well as mental health programs.\n\nThe president is also pressing forward with plans to slash funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, despite Congress\u2019s rejection of a similar plan last year. The budget blueprint would pare the agency by $2.8 billion, or 34 percent from its current level, while eliminating virtually all climate change-related programs.

A bigger Republican structural advantage means the G.O.P. can withstand a larger Democratic advantage on the generic ballot.\n\nBy this measure, the Republican advantage has probably dropped by about two percentage points since 2014, when Republicans won the party\u2019s largest House majority since 1929.\n\nSince then, four court rulings have softened or even torn up Republican gerrymanders in four big states: Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and most recently Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map last month.\n\nThe decisions in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia have already cost the Republicans a net of three House seats while generally eroding their position elsewhere in those states, giving Democrats better opportunities in 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to have a good idea of how much Republicans might lose in Pennsylvania, but it is reasonable to expect that the new map will cost the party at least one seat and erode its position in several others.\n\nGerrymandering is not the only reason Democrats are at a disadvantage. Republicans also have the advantage of incumbency, which, on average, allows members to run about seven percentage points ahead of the national party.\n\nBut Republicans have gradually been losing the advantages of incumbency as well, most obviously because of 34 recent retirements in Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nOver all, the number of G.O.P. retirements in plausibly competitive districts isn\u2019t extraordinarily high. But some of the Republican retirements have been especially damaging: longtime incumbents who have a tradition of running far ahead of the national party and dissuading strong challengers, like New Jersey\u2019s Frank LoBiondo or Pennsylvania\u2019s Charlie Dent. Their retirements could easily be the difference between a non-competitive race and a Democratic victory.\n\nThe Republican incumbency advantage has diminished in another way: Democratic recruitment and fund-raising. A strong Democratic recruit \u2014 like a military veteran or an elected official \u2014 can cut into that advantage, especially with strong fund-raising numbers.\n\nAs measured by biographical indicators like military experience or past elected officials, Democratic recruitment is only somewhat above average at this stage. But much like the Republican retirements, the best Democratic recruits have often been extremely valuable.\n\nOften, Democrats have succeeded in finding their very best candidates in white working-class districts where President Trump fared well in 2016. His strength threatened to move many traditional battlegrounds into the Republican column. The Democratic path to a House majority arguably looked even more difficult after the 2016 presidential than it did before \u2014 even though Democrats picked up seven seats in that election, since so many traditional battleground districts swung hard for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut strong Democratic recruiting in Trump Country has kept many traditional battlegrounds on the list, like Illinois\u2019 12th or Kentucky\u2019s Sixth. The Democrats might have an easier time finding qualified and experienced recruits in white working-class districts in part because Democrats have a track record of winning there, and therefore a deeper bench, even if Mr. Trump won a particular district.\n\nIn contrast, the Democrats don\u2019t have much of a bench at all in many of the well-educated but traditionally Republican districts where Mr. Trump struggled the most. Here it\u2019s the Democratic fund-raising that is most impressive. Last quarter, 134 Democrats in 83 districts raised at least $100,000 in individual contributions. Those successes have been disproportionately concentrated in well-educated areas.\n\nIt\u2019s the working-class districts where Democrats are likeliest to have true recruiting holes, like New York\u2019s 24th or California\u2019s 21st. That might seem somewhat odd because Democrats have had so much success luring top-tier candidates in working-class districts.\n\nIn fact, Democrats do have well-qualified, potential candidates in these districts, like the state assemblyman Rudy Salas or the former Syracuse mayor Stephanie Miner, but many aren\u2019t running. (Mr. Salas hasn\u2019t entered the race in California\u2019s 21, and Ms. Miner has decided not to run in New York\u2019s 24th.) It seems these areas may not be stocked with ambitious, well-to-do and well-connected liberals eager to run when an elected official doesn\u2019t step forward.\n\nEven so, Democrats still seem poised to have viable if imperfect candidates in a large number of battleground districts. Upshot estimates indicate that Democrats would need to win the popular vote by 7.4 points \u2014 albeit with a healthy margin of error of plus or minus more than four points \u2014 to take the House. Today, most estimates put the generic congressional ballot very near that number. So far from the election, the fight for control remains a tossup.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot. He covers elections, polling and demographics.

Credit Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a week, the White House has shifted its story about how and when members of the Trump administration learned about the domestic abuse allegations that forced Rob Porter, one of President Trump\u2019s top aides, to resign.\n\nOn Tuesday, the director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, contradicted the latest White House timeline, disclosing that the bureau informed the White House on three separate occasions about the status of the background check into Mr. Porter.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, later offered a new timeline, blaming career employees in the White House security office for failing to inform senior West Wing aides of the accusations against Mr. Porter.\n\n2003-2008\n\nMarriage to Colbie Holderness\n\n2003\n\nMr. Porter married Colbie Holderness weeks after the couple graduated from Harvard University and Wellesley College. She later told The Intercept that while on their honeymoon in the Canary Islands, Mr. Porter kicked her during an argument.\n\n2005\n\nWhile on vacation in Florence, Ms. Holderness took a photograph of herself with a black eye, which she said was taken shortly after Mr. Porter punched her. After the photos were published in The Intercept, Mr. Porter said in a statement that the images were misleading. \u201cI took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago, and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described,\u201d he said.\n\n2008\n\nMr. Porter and Ms. Holderness divorced.\n\n2009-2013\n\nMarriage to Jennifer Willoughby\n\nNov. 26, 2009\n\nMr. Porter married Jennifer Willoughby. During their honeymoon, Ms. Willoughby said, Mr. Porter frequently became angry and yelled expletives at her.\n\nJune 19, 2010\n\nMs. Willoughby filed a protective order against Mr. Porter in an Arlington County, Va., court after saying that he violated their separation agreement, came to their apartment and punched the glass in the door to their home.\n\nNovember 2013\n\nMr. Porter and Ms. Willoughby divorced.\n\nDecember 2016\n\nA woman dating Mr. Porter at the time reached out to Ms. Willoughby and Ms. Holderness, detailing abuse and seeking advice on how to leave him.\n\n\u201cI work in politics, and despite Rob\u2019s repeated abuse, some of which I think many know about, he continues to rise and I\u2019m afraid to go against him,\u201d the woman wrote to Ms. Holderness, according to Facebook messages. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you. I wanted to reach out and hear your story if you are willing to share \u2014 as well as how you broke out of it with him and mostly, how you recovered.\u201d\n\n2017\n\nThe Background Investigation Begins\n\nJanuary\n\nOn Jan. 20, Mr. Porter became White House staff secretary and assistant to the president for policy coordination. He was responsible for paper flow to the president and was later involved in drafting President Trump\u2019s inaugural State of the Union address.\n\nMr. Porter told Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, that he was concerned about his former wives coming forward with potentially damaging accusations.\n\nDespite that conversation, the White House granted Mr. Porter an interim security clearance to handle highly classified materials going to the president.\n\nF.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Holderness and Ms. Willoughby as part of an investigation for Mr. Porter\u2019s security clearance in the White House, and both women discussed the domestic abuse allegations. In January, Ms. Willoughby said, Mr. Porter sent a mutual friend to speak to her husband, Skiffington Holderness, about the interview.\n\nMarch\n\nThe F.B.I. delivered to the White House a partial report on problems in Mr. Porter\u2019s background, Mr. Wray told senators Tuesday. Mr. Wray did not detail what was in the report or specify who at the White House received that information.\n\nIn its initial explanations of the timeline, the White House did not disclose receiving information from the F.B.I. in March.\n\nImage Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, contradicted the White House timeline in testimony on Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Credit Lawrence Jackson for The New York Times\n\nOn Tuesday, after Mr. Wray\u2019s testimony, two people briefed on the situation said the information delivered to the White House in March was only basic employment information, not allegations of abuse.\n\nMs. Sanders said on Tuesday that information from the F.B.I. would have been received by the White House personnel security office. She said she was not aware that anyone at the security office disclosed in March to any official in the West Wing that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background check.\n\nApril 24\n\nMs. Willoughby published a blog post titled \u201cWhy I Stayed,\u201d in which she described an abusive marriage with Mr. Porter, but did not name him. She said Mr. Porter later called her multiple times to demand that she remove the post.\n\nSummer 2017\n\nThe F.B.I. Delivers Its Assessment\n\nJuly\n\nMr. Wray testified on Tuesday that the F.B.I. gave the White House \u201ca completed background investigation\u201d in late July. Mr. Wray again declined to say who at the White House the F.B.I. communicated with when they delivered the completed background investigation.\n\nMr. Wray said that \u201csoon thereafter\u201d the bureau received a request for a \u201cfollow-up inquiry\u201d about Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation. Mr. Wray did not disclose what the follow-up inquiry was, or who made it.\n\nPeople briefed on the situation said officials at the security office encouraged the F.B.I. to interview Mr. Porter before closing its background investigation.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that she was not aware that anyone in the White House security office contacted any senior official in the West Wing about Mr. Porter\u2019s background check issues in July.\n\nHowever, people briefed on the issue said Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation. The White House disputed that assertion, saying that Mr. McGahn was unaware of any problem.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the security office believed that the F.B.I. report in July \u201crequired significant additional investigatory fieldwork\u201d before security officials could decide whether to recommend a security clearance for Mr. Porter. They asked the F.B.I. to do more work on it, she said.\n\nSeptember\n\nAccording to Ms. Willoughby, White House officials informed Mr. Porter that his security clearance \u201chad not gone through,\u201d as she recalled him saying. She said he told her that \u201csomeone had told him that there was a violent allegation and that was what was holding it up.\u201d An F.B.I. agent emailed Ms. Willoughby, asking for permission to gain access to the 2010 restraining order, writing, \u201cin furtherance of the background investigation.\u201d\n\nFall 2017\n\nSecurity Office Begins Evaluating Porter\n\nNovember\n\nThe F.B.I. delivered to the White House the results of the requested \u201cfollow-up\u201d to Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, according to Mr. Wray.\n\nTwo people briefed on the matter said that by November, Mr. Porter had been interviewed by the F.B.I.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the security office received from the F.B.I. in November what it considered to be the \u201cfinal background investigation report\u201d and began evaluating Mr. Porter\u2019s request for a security clearance.\n\nWhite House officials and people briefed on the case said the F.B.I. delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was unlikely to succeed in receiving a permanent clearance. They said security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final decision on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nMs. Sanders said she was not aware that anyone in the security office communicated in November to any senior official in the West Wing about problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nBut multiple people familiar with the situation have said top officials \u2014 including Mr. McGahn; John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; and Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff \u2014 learned in November that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nImage Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. Credit Andrew Harnik/Associated Press\n\nOne person briefed on the situation, who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, disputes that, saying that Mr. McGahn did not learn of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office in November.\n\nBut people close to Mr. McGahn said that a woman who had been dating Mr. Porter for some time came to Mr. McGahn in mid-November to complain about Mr. Porter. The woman, who knew Mr. McGahn well, was upset because she had discovered that Mr. Porter was also dating Hope Hicks, the White House communications director. The people briefed on the conversation said the woman did not claim physical abuse, but told Mr. McGahn that he should not trust Mr. Porter.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nMr. Porter\u2019s background check investigation was \u201cadministratively closed,\u201d Mr. Wray said during his testimony Tuesday, weeks before the allegations become public. The bureau \u201creceived some additional information\u201d after the file was closed, he said, and passed that on to the White House as well.\n\nMr. Wray said he was \u201cquite confident\u201d that established protocol was followed.\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nA Public Accounting\n\nFeb. 6\n\nAllegations of physical abuse from Ms. Holderness and Ms. Willoughby, Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives, were published in The Daily Mail. Ms. Hicks worked with other White House officials to draft statements supporting Mr. Porter.\n\nThose statements included one from Mr. Kelly, who described Mr. Porter \u201ca man of true integrity and honor.\u201d\n\nImage John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, at a press briefing in October. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who once employed Mr. Porter as chief of staff, said in a statement that \u201cthe country needs more honest, principled people like Rob Porter, which is why I hope that this cynical campaign to discredit his character ultimately fails.\u201d\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the White House security office was still evaluating the results of Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, and had not yet come to a conclusion when the allegations against Mr. Porter were published.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nMr. Porter, despite the support from senior White House officials, announced his resignation. In a statement, he said that \u201cthese allegations are simply false,\u201d even as more details and photos said to be a result of the abuse circulated in a new interview published in The Intercept.\n\nMs. Sanders also issued a statement saying that both the president and Mr. Kelly had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Mr. Porter\u2019s performance. Mr. Kelly released a new statement later that day, around 10 p.m., saying he had been unaware of the allegations against Mr. Porter.\n\nMr. Hatch, for his part, described himself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the new allegations.\n\nFeb. 8\n\nWhite House officials conceded regrets about how they handled the accusations against Mr. Porter. At a news briefing, Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Kelly had not been aware of the allegations, and that the security clearance investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background had been continuing until his resignation.\n\n\u201cHis background investigation was ongoing,\u201d Mr. Shah told reporters. \u201cHe was operating on an interim security clearance. His clearance was never denied, and he resigned.\u201d\n\nImage Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, was asked on Thursday about the allegations against Mr. Porter. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nMr. Kelly told staff members that he had learned the details of Mr. Porter\u2019s situation only \u201c40 minutes before he threw him out\u201d two days earlier. In a memo sent that night, Mr. Kelly wrote: \u201cWhile we are all processing the shocking and troubling allegations made against a former White House staffer, I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence very seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nFeb. 9\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged the accusations facing Mr. Porter, saying that it was a \u201ctough time\u201d for his former aide. The president added, \u201cHe also, as you probably know, says he is innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d Mr. Kelly also told White House officials that he was willing to step down over his handling of the allegations.\n\nThat evening, the White House announced that Derek Lyons, another lawyer educated at Harvard Law School and Mr. Porter\u2019s No. 2, had been elevated to acting staff secretary.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nA day after Mr. Trump complained that a \u201cmere allegation\u201d could ruin someone without due process, White House aides fanned out to talk shows to say that Mr. Porter had lied to them and deserved to be pushed out.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nWhile testifying in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, contradicted the White House timeline and confirmed for the first time that the bureau had given the White House a partial report on problems in Mr. Porter\u2019s background in March. He also said the bureau had closed its investigation in January, though the White House had insisted that it was still continuing well into February.\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.\n\nMichael D.

The senator has avoided any criticism of Mr. Trump in recent weeks and on Monday met with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s political advisers, getting wind of the meeting, scrambled to brief Ms. Trump and her own staff about Mr. Corker\u2019s renewed interest in running again and his desire for the president\u2019s support, according to a Republican official. An aide to Mr. Corker said Ms. Trump requested the meeting.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. Corker\u2019s advisers say he and Mr. Trump have patched up their relationship and the senator is simply hearing out those who would like him to remain in the Senate, a decision he technically does not have to make until Tennessee\u2019s filing deadline in early April.\n\n\u201cIn recent days, people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda,\u201d said Micah Johnson, Mr. Corker\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Corker is not the only Republican who could shake up a closely watched Senate race.

Image A book about \u201cFake News\u201d was displayed last November by a supporter of Roy Moore, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Alabama. Credit Brynn Anderson/Associated Press\n\nHow easy is it to change people\u2019s votes in an election?\n\nThe answer, a growing number of studies conclude, is that most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all.\n\nThis conclusion may sound jarring at a time when people are concerned about the effects of the false news articles that flooded Facebook and other online outlets during the 2016 election. Observers speculated that these so-called fake news articles swung the election to Donald J. Trump. Similar suggestions of large persuasion effects, supposedly pushing Mr. Trump to victory, have been made about online advertising from the firm Cambridge Analytica and content promoted by Russian bots.\n\nMuch more remains to be learned about the effects of these types of online activities, but people should not assume they had huge effects. Previous studies have found, for instance, that the effects of even television advertising (arguably a higher-impact medium) are very small. According to one credible estimate, the net effect of exposure to an additional ad shifts the partisan vote of approximately two people out of 10,000.\n\nIn fact, a recent meta-analysis of numerous different forms of campaign persuasion, including in-person canvassing and mail, finds that their average effect in general elections is zero.\n\nField experiments testing the effects of online ads on political candidates and issues have also found null effects. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised \u2014 it\u2019s hard to change people\u2019s minds! Their votes are shaped by fundamental factors like which party they typically support and how they view the state of the economy. \u201cFake news\u201d and bots are likely to have vastly smaller effects, especially given how polarized our politics have become.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should look for in evaluating claims about vast persuasion effects from dubious online content:\n\nHow many people actually saw the questionable material. Many alarming statistics have been produced since the election about how many times \u201cfake news\u201d was shared on Facebook or how many times Russian bots retweeted content on Twitter. These statistics obscure the fact that the content being shared may not reach many Americans (most people are not on Twitter and consume relatively little political news) or even many humans (many bot followers may themselves be bots).\n\nWhether the people being exposed are persuadable. Dubious political content online is disproportionately likely to reach heavy news consumers who already have strong opinions. For instance, a study I conducted with Andrew Guess of Princeton and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter in Britain showed that exposure to fake news websites before the 2016 election was heavily concentrated among the 10 percent of Americans with the most conservative information diets \u2014 not exactly swing voters.\n\nThe proportion of news people saw that is bogus. The total number of shares or likes that fake news and bots attract can sound enormous until you consider how much information circulates online. Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election \u2014 certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.\n\nSimilarly, my study with Mr. Guess and Mr. Reifler found that the mean number of articles on fake news websites visited by Trump supporters was 13.1, but only 40 percent of his supporters visited such websites, and they represented only about 6 percent of the pages they visited on sites focusing on news topics.\n\nNone of these findings indicate that fake news and bots aren\u2019t worrisome signs for American democracy. They can mislead and polarize citizens, undermine trust in the media, and distort the content of public debate. But those who want to combat online misinformation should take steps based on evidence and data, not hype or speculation.\n\nBrendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College.

But many White House officials were already souring on Mr. Kelly even before his handling of the abuse allegations against Mr. Porter gave his internal critics new ammunition against him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has expressed frustration with Mr. Kelly as well, but has sent mixed signals about whether he might replace him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former contestant on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who worked in the White House until Mr. Kelly pushed her out in December, cried as she described her experiences during a new episode of \u201cThe Celebrity Big Brother\u201d that aired on CBS last week.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m there fighting, fighting, fighting, getting my head bashed in, and nobody coming out publicly to say, \u2018We support her,\u2019\u201d she told a fellow competitor. Asked if the nation would be O.K., she said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s going to not be O.K. It\u2019s not.\u201d She added that she would not vote for Mr. Trump again \u201cin a million years, never.\u201d\n\nBeyond those leaving, many positions have never been filled nearly 13 months after the inauguration. Some of those vacancies stem from the glacial pace of background investigations and the Senate confirmation process, which has grown worse with each successive president. But in many cases, the Trump administration has still not identified candidates.\n\nAccording to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that tracks appointments along with The Washington Post, the Trump administration has made the fewest nominations, not counting those that have failed, and has had the fewest confirmed by this point of any of the last five administrations. At the State Department, nominees have yet to be made for three under secretary positions and 10 assistant secretary positions, senior-level jobs that have traditionally been crucial to managing foreign policy.\n\nNow in its second year, the president\u2019s team is trying to get ahead of the situation. The White House on Friday released a raft of appointments. But a vast majority of the 32 announced were actually just promotions from within, or additional titles for existing staff members.\n\nThe top two appointments on the list were James Carroll as acting national drug policy director and John DeStefano as counselor to the president, both choices that underlined the challenges for the White House.\n\nFor Mr. Carroll, it will be his fourth job in the White House since the administration\u2019s inception; he started in the White House counsel\u2019s office, then became general counsel for the budget office and served most recently as deputy chief of staff. For Mr. DeStefano, the new title was a recognition that he has already effectively been overseeing the offices of personnel, political affairs and public liaison.\n\nThe constant churning exacts a toll. \u201cIt takes time for any group to jell and learn the ropes of governing, and that is definitely complicated by turnover,\u201d said Lisa Brown, a top White House official under Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. \u201cEvery new person has to learn the ropes and changes the team dynamic.

Credit Andrew Cullen/Reuters\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday moved to repeal one of the last unchallenged climate-change regulations rushed into place in the waning days of the Obama presidency \u2014 a rule restricting the release of planet-warming methane into the atmosphere.\n\nThe rule, which applied to companies drilling for energy on federal land, has been the subject of intense court battles and delay efforts, as well as one surprise vote last year in which Senate Republicans temporarily saved it from being torpedoed.\n\nMethane, which is about 25 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, accounts for 9 percent of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions; about a third of that is estimated to come from oil and gas operations. Under the rule, oil and gas companies would have been required to capture leaked methane, update their equipment and write new plans for minimizing waste when drilling on government property.\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management described the rule as costly, redundant and overly burdensome.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve energy dominance through responsible energy production, we need smart regulations, not punitive regulations,\u201d Joe Balash, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said Monday in a statement .\n\nThe move came as the Trump administration released an $11.3 billion budget for the Interior Department that emphasized the development of domestic energy resources and \u201cresponsible development of energy on public lands and offshore waters.\u201d\n\nThe methane waste rule was aimed at accidental gas leaks and the process of venting and burning off leaked gas, known as flaring, from oil and gas wells on public lands. It was created as part of a broad strategy to tackle climate change as well as wasteful releases of gas. The Bureau of Land Management estimated in 2016 that the rule would prevent as much as 180,000 tons of methane emissions annually, about the equivalent of taking 950,000 cars off the road.\n\nThe oil and gas industry argued that the rule could cost as much as $279 million to implement and would hinder production. The industry made repeal of the regulation a top priority.\n\nAn early effort to revoke the regulation hit a snag in May when Senators John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, all Republicans, voted against a Senate resolution that would have eliminated it. The lawmakers said they were concerned that the resolution would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.\n\nThe Interior Department then twice tried to suspend the regulation, an effort that is still being challenged in court.\n\nWestern lawmakers on Monday cheered the repeal, saying the rule would have discouraged energy production and job growth. \u201cThe previous administration scorned domestic energy development and crafted the prior rule to deliberately stifle it,\u201d said Representative Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources. He called the repeal \u201ca necessary step.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental activists denounced the plan and noted that the repeal would return the Bureau of Land Management to a set of policies dealing with methane waste that are almost 40 years old. \u201cGutting the rule would allow unchecked waste of natural gas, unnecessary pollution and the loss of revenue to communities and tribes to address critical needs such as schools and roads,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nThe agency is expected to publish the proposal in the Federal Register, which will kick off a 60-day public comment period. A final repeal of the rule would come after that.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

Credit John Moore/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With the fate of hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants in the balance, the Senate on Monday began an open-ended debate on immigration \u2014 an exceedingly rare step that, in effect, will allow senators to attempt to build a bill from scratch on the Senate floor.\n\nThe highly unusual debate, expected to unfold throughout the week, will test whether a series of legislative concepts and proposals championed by President Trump and a variety of Republicans and Democrats can garner 60 votes, the threshold for a measure to pass the Senate. No one has any idea how it will turn out.\n\n\u201cWhoever gets to 60 wins,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, told reporters last week. \u201cAnd it will be an opportunity for 1,000 flowers to bloom.\u201d\n\nThe debate kicked off Monday evening with a procedural vote on an unrelated House-passed measure that will serve as a shell for building an immigration bill. By a vote of 97 to 1, with only Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, dissenting, senators took the first step toward consideration of the underlying measure, as expected.\n\nThe push on immigration comes against the backdrop of a ticking clock, and months of congressional inaction.\n\nAbout 700,000 young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children are shielded from deportation under an Obama-era initiative known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Another 1.1 million young immigrants are eligible for DACA but did not apply. But Mr. Trump suspended the initiative in September and gave lawmakers until March 5 to come up with a replacement that would protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, after proposed legislation called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM Act.\n\nLiberal interest groups and immigration rights activists have mobilized to insist on legal status for the Dreamers without the concessions demanded by the president and immigration hard-liners: billions for a wall on the Mexican border, an even more aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants and dramatic changes to the legal immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants over the family members of citizens and green-card holders.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate is poised to start debate on the humanitarian crisis Donald Trump caused when he cruelly ended DACA, here\u2019s what every sitting Senator should remember: Americans want the Dream Act \u2014 not cruel deals that go against basic American values,\u201d said Corinne Ball, campaign director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group.\n\nConservatives and anti-immigration groups are just as vociferous.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obama who created a cruel situation by making promises to a group of illegal aliens who he had no authority to promise what he gave them,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limiting immigration. \u201cPresident Trump had a duty to rescind that policy, because the Constitution makes very clear that Congress, not the White House, sets the laws in this land.\u201d\n\nIn such a polarized environment, there is a significant chance that the Senate will pass nothing by the end of the week \u2014 or that whatever measure the Senate does adopt will be thwarted by the House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have something in the Senate that we haven\u2019t had in a while,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real debate on an issue where we really don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d\n\nVideo About 800,000 young unauthorized immigrants are protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. We spoke with a few of them in September, when President Trump announced his intention to end the Obama-era program.\n\nImmigration is one of the most emotional, contentious issues in Washington. The last time Congress seriously considered immigration legislation was in 2013, when the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration overhaul with 68 votes. But that measure, which offered a path to citizenship for about 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally \u2014 including the Dreamers \u2014 was never taken up by the House.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s election, on a wave of anti-immigrant fervor, has made the current negotiations even more difficult, senators say. The negotiations are complicated by Republicans\u2019 demands to pair any protection for DACA recipients with an increase in border security, and limits on legal immigration, and by conflicting pronouncements from Mr. Trump.\n\nAfter telling lawmakers last month that he would sign whatever they sent him, Mr. Trump now insists that any proposal address what the White House is calling \u201cfour pillars\u201d: protection for DACA recipients; an end to what Mr. Trump calls \u201cchain migration,\u201d in which legal immigrants can sponsor their family members; an end to the diversity visa lottery, which is aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented countries; and full funding for the proposed border wall, estimated to cost $25 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe White House recently put forth its own proposal that meets those conditions; it would offer 1.8 million Dreamers a path to citizenship, in exchange for strict limits on legal immigration and the full $25 billion for the border wall. A number of Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have drafted legislation that mirrors the White House plan, which will almost certainly be introduced as an amendment. Mr. McConnell said on Monday that he supported it.\n\nThe American people have \u201cheard many of my colleagues across the aisle insist this issue requires swift action,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cNow is the time to back up the talk with the hard work of finding a workable solution. That means finding an agreement that can pass the Senate, pass the House and which the president will sign \u2014 not just making a point.\u201d\n\nSeveral other proposals are floating around Capitol Hill, but so far none has garnered the backing of the White House. A bipartisan group calling itself the Common Sense Coalition, led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, has been working on its own measure but has not released a plan.\n\nThat group is focused on a narrower bill than the president would like, one that would pair a path to citizenship for the Dreamers with funding for the border wall.\n\n\u201cThe only way to achieve a solution to the DACA crisis is to keep it simple,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the coalition, said on the Senate floor Monday.\n\nBut Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, said he could not support a bill that addresses only DACA and border security. \u201cThe president\u2019s indicated he would not sign such a bill, so that really doesn\u2019t meet my definition of success,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, the idea of an open-ended debate is so novel that many newer senators say they have never experienced one, and are scurrying to learn the rules.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of us, we\u2019re going to have to learn this process,\u201d said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who was elected in 2014.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, marveled, \u201cBeen here seven years \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights groups are nervous, and do not know quite what to expect. Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant rights group, put it this way: \u201cThis is going to be an uncertain, wild week.\u201d\n\nThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

But over and over again, local water systems around the country have failed to meet these requirements.\n\nIn a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that, since 1982, between 3 and 10 percent of the country\u2019s water systems have been in violation of federal Safe Drinking Water Act health standards each year. In 2015 alone, as many as 21 million Americans may have been exposed to unsafe drinking water.\n\nThe problem is particularly severe in low-income rural areas, the study found. And the researchers identified several places, including Oklahoma and West Texas, that have repeatedly fallen short in complying with water safety rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency over the past decade.\n\n\u201cThese are often smaller communities flying under the radar,\u201d said Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of California, Irvine, and a lead author of the study. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to maintain their aging infrastructure, and they\u2019re struggling to keep up with the latest water treatment techniques.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the safety of America\u2019s tap water gained national prominence after the 2015 crisis in Flint, Mich., when residents discovered dangerously high levels of lead in their drinking water. Since then, a barrage of reports have revealed that a surprisingly large number of local water systems serving millions of Americans sometimes contain unsafe levels of contaminants like lead, nitrates, arsenic or pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nIn many cases, it can be unclear whether such contamination is isolated or evidence of a deeper systemic problem at a water utility.\n\nTo address that issue in this newest study, Dr. Allaire and her co-authors looked for patterns in health-based violations over time at 17,900 local water systems around the United States between 1982 and 2015. She said one question guiding the research was \u201cWhat kind of factors make some water utilities more susceptible than others?\u201d\n\nOne striking finding: Health violations for drinking water surged in rural areas in the 2000s after the E.P.A. enacted regulations focused on disinfectants. Utilities have long used chlorine or other chemicals to disinfect their drinking water supplies. But this process has a troubling side effect. Those chemicals can react with organic matter in the water to create new compounds that may pose their own health risks.\n\nIn recent years, the E.P.A. has required water utilities to limit these disinfectant byproducts, though doing so can be costly and technically challenging. That often poses difficulties for rural water utilities with smaller customer bases and fewer financial resources.\n\n\u201cMany of these smaller utilities have just a handful of people who are charged with managing the entire system,\u201d said Manuel P. Teodoro, a political scientist at Texas A&M University who has studied the challenges facing small and rural water utilities.\n\nHe noted that this research suggests one possible strategy for improving water quality in rural areas: States might provide aid to help smaller water utilities merge and consolidate into larger systems that are better able to comply with complex safety rules. California has been exploring such an approach.\n\nDr. Allaire and her co-authors also found that water systems that serve minority and low-income communities were more likely to violate federal standards around coliform bacteria, which frequently accompany disease-causing pathogens. Their research also showed that privately owned utilities had fewer violations than publicly owned utilities, and that larger water systems tended to have fewer violations than smaller systems.\n\nThe whole point of tracing these patterns, Dr. Allaire said, was to help policymakers understand which parts of the United States might require additional scrutiny or assistance in meeting national water quality standards. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have no systematic way to identify problems and set priorities.\u201d\n\nThis new study may understate the full extent of problems with the nation\u2019s drinking water systems, said Kristi Pullen Fedinick, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that conducted its own nationwide survey of Safe Drinking Water Act violations last year.\n\nState governments are largely responsible for implementing federal water-quality standards, and the quality of monitoring and enforcement can vary significantly. Some states have cut back on budgets for their drinking water programs, and many communities focus on tracking just a handful of key contaminants like coliform or disinfectant byproducts. That means potential violations involving other contaminants, like lead, may go underreported.\n\n\u201cOn a national scale, we know that there\u2019s a huge amount of underreporting,\u201d Dr. Fedinick said.\n\nIn recent years, the E.P.A. and Justice Department have often been reluctant to penalize states or municipalities that fall behind on enforcement or reporting. The federal government can, however, provide technical assistance and funding to water utilities that are struggling with health violations.\n\nScott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A., has expressed interest in modernizing the nation\u2019s water infrastructure, telling Congress this month that he wants to declare a \u201cwar on lead.\u201d He has not yet detailed a plan for doing so, although he has supported increases in funding for an E.P.A. program that can provide low-interest loans for state water projects.\n\nBut environmental groups like Natural Resources Defense Council have viewed Mr. Pruitt\u2019s promises with suspicion, asserting that the Trump administration\u2019s push for sharp budget cuts to other important federal drinking water programs at both the E.P.A. and the Department of Agriculture could end up undercutting water safety.\n\nBrad Plumer is a reporter covering climate change, energy policy and other environmental issues for The Times's climate team. @bradplumer Nadja Popovich is a reporter and graphics editor on the Times's climate team. @popovichN Order Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 10 of the New York edition with the headline: Poor Americans Exposed to Unsafe Water, Study Shows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat on Earth Is Going On?

{"title": "\n                    What\u2019s in the White House Budget Request?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/us/politics/trump-budget-request.html", "text": "Rosy Assumptions on the Economy\u2019s Growth\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan could easily result in much larger federal deficits.\n\nThe administration made its calculations using assumptions about the nation\u2019s economic trajectory that are more optimistic than the consensus among private-sector forecasters, or the assumptions used by other parts of the government.\n\nThe forecasts in Monday\u2019s plan are also significantly more optimistic than the Trump administration itself used in its budget calculations last year.\n\nMost notably, the administration projected annualized economic growth of 3.1 percent over the next three years. The Federal Reserve in December projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate at about 2.4 percent.\n\nThere is a similar gap in the projections of long-term growth. If the less optimistic forecasts were correct, the government would collect significantly less revenue. By its own estimates, the result would be another $3 trillion in federal debt.\n\nThe administration attributed the difference to the expectation that the president\u2019s policies would significantly increase productivity growth.\n\nJason Furman, the former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, calculated that productivity growth would have to reach the highest level in any decade since the immediate aftermath of the World War II. Productivity growth was 1.1 percent over the last decade; it would have to reach 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to understand where this growth would be coming from,\u201d Mr. Furman tweeted.\n\n\u2014Jim Tankersley\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA 5% Reduction for the Department of Education\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s 2019 budget proposal requests $63.2 billion in discretionary spending at the Education Department, a reduction of $3.6 billion, or 5 percent, from 2017 spending levels.\n\nThe proposal calls for a $1.5 billion \u201cschool choice\u201d program, which includes taxpayer-funded scholarships for private schools and a vast expansion of charter schools. However, the budget would eliminate or cut 39 programs including two staple programs in public schools that provide teacher training and after-school programs to low-income children.\n\nThe Department\u2019s budget also funds initiatives that Mr. Trump has given lip service to in the last year, calling for $43 million in \u201cSchool Climate Transformation\u201d grants to help fight the opioid epidemic in schools, and $200 million in new grants to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics education.\n\n\u2014Erica A. Green\n\nA Hint at the Special Counsel\u2019s Timeline\n\nThe proposal indicates that the work of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, could last another year and a half. It allocates $10 million to his office from October 2018 through the end of September 2019.\n\nBut that does not mean the Russia investigation itself will last that long. The office would also oversee a trial of Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, who has pleaded not guilty to charges he laundered millions of dollars through overseas shell companies. No trial date has been set, but the judge in the case has indicated it would not start before the fall.\n\nDocuments released last year by the special counsel\u2019s office, which is part of the Justice Department, provided a view into its expenses. Those documents showed that between the time the office was opened in May and the end of September it racked up $3.2 million in costs. The largest portion of that money \u2014 $1.7 million \u2014 went to personnel, compensation and benefits. The second highest cost was for the \u201cacquisition of equipment\u201d at $733,969.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s $28 billion proposed budget overall is relatively flat from last year, with notable increases in spending to combat violent crime and drug use as well as house more prisoners. The department wants to increase its immigration enforcement efforts and add 75 immigration judges and support staff. The department counts more than 117,000 employees.\n\nTo offset the spending increases, the Justice Department plans to close two of its six Bureau of Prisons regional administrative offices and two of its seven minimum security prisons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014Katie Benner\n\nTargets Planned Parenthood\n\nThe president\u2019s budget singles out abortion providers and would prohibit Health and Human Services funding, including money used for family planning, from going to any clinic or health care facility that also offers abortion services.\n\nThough the language is broadly written, its intended target is Planned Parenthood, which relies on government funding to offer a variety of services to women other than abortion. The budget would help achieve the longstanding goal of social conservatives to cut off Planned Parenthood from federal assistance.\n\n\u2014Jeremy W. Peters\n\nBig Changes for Food Stamps\n\nThe White House is proposing a significant change for a low-income food program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. The White House proposes to cut funding for the program by about $213 billion \u2014 or 30 percent \u2014 over a decade. It also wants to change how SNAP recipients get their food, replacing a portion of the benefits that allow SNAP recipients to go to a grocery store to purchase food with a package of \u201cnutritious\u201d American-grown food delivered to SNAP households.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe White House says the proposal is \u201ca bold new approach\u201d to administering SNAP that combines traditional benefits with \u201c100-percent American grown foods provided directly to households.\u201d\n\nMore for Immigration Enforcement and a Border Wall\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security would receive $46 billion, a $3.4 billion increase over the enacted 2017 budget, all part of the administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and build a wall on the border with Mexico. The request calls for $18 billion for border security, including $1.6 billion to build about 65 miles of the wall in South Texas. The request also calls for the department to hire 2,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 750 Border Patrol agents.\n\nWhile most of the budget increases focus on illegal immigration and border security, the administration also requested funding to hire 450 new agents for the chronically-short staffed Secret Service, $1 billion for the department\u2019s cybersecurity efforts and $71 million for new scanning technology for the Transportation Security Administration. The new budget request would provide $1.9 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s grant program to state and local communities, $800 million less than the $2.7 billion funded in 2017.\n\n\u2014Ron Nixon\n\nDeep Cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s second federal spending plan proposes steep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency, despite Congress\u2019 rejection of a similar plan last year to dramatically shrink the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 budget blueprint would pare the E.P.A. by $2.8 billion or 34 percent from its current level, while eliminating virtually all climate change-related programs. It also would cut the agency\u2019s Office of Science and Technology nearly in half, to $489 million from its current $762 million.\n\nIn outlining the budget, the administration said the E.P.A. is refocusing on what it called \u201ccore activities\u201d and eliminating \u201clower priority programs.\u201d That list includes a program to promote partnerships with the private sector to tackle climate change; environmental education training; and an effort to protect marine estuaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House estimated cutting those programs and others will save taxpayers $600 million compared to 2017 levels.\n\n\u2014Lisa Friedman\n\nAnother Call to Repeal the Affordable Care Act\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes once again to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act and to eliminate the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. More than 30 states have expanded Medicaid under the law. Republican efforts to dismantle the law failed in Congress last year.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said there would be \u201cno cuts\u201d to Medicare or Medicaid if he won the election. But his 2019 budget request is full of proposals to squeeze savings out of the two programs, which together provide health insurance for more than 100 million Americans.\n\nProposed savings in Medicare total more than $490 billion over 10 years, or about 5 percent of Medicare spending expected under current law.\n\nThe budget would cut $69.5 billion over 10 years in projected Medicare payments to hospitals for \u201cuncompensated care.\u201d It would cut more than $95 billion over 10 years from nursing homes and home health agencies, and $22 billion from Medicare Advantage plans, which manage care for about one-third of Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nIn addition, the budget would cut $48 billion over 10 years in Medicare payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education,\n\nThe budget includes several proposals intended to reduce out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries by requiring insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to share at least one-third of the discounts and price concessions they receive from drug manufacturers. The budget would also establish a limit on beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs covered by Medicare.\n\n\u2014Robert Pear\n\nParing Back a Dodd-Frank Watchdog\n\nThe Treasury Department plan calls for continuing to cut the budget of the Office of Financial Research, which was set up in the wake of the financial crisis to help federal agencies stay ahead of financial risks. The office, which provides analysis and research to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has previously been targeted for both funding and personnel cuts. \u201cThe Budget reflects continued reductions in O.F.R. spending commensurate with the renewed fiscal discipline being applied across the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChanging the Role of the A.T.F.\n\nThe budget would allocate $28 billion to the Justice Department \u2014 a 1.2 percent decrease from the department\u2019s 2017 budget. That budget funds agencies like the F.B.I., the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration. The budget proposal would take tobacco and alcohol enforcement authority away from the A.T.F. and move those authorities to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe D.E.A. would receive an addition $41 million to specifically combat the opioid crisis, and the agency would also take over the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which is currently run by the White House drug czar\u2019s office.\n\n\u2014Ali Watkins\n\nState Department Gets Less Funding\n\nAt the State Department and USAID, the president\u2019s budget proposes a base budget of $25.8 billion, a $9 billion decrease in funding from the 2017 enacted budget. This is a 26 percent decrease in funding, similar to the president\u2019s budgetary intentions last year.\n\nNotably, the president\u2019s new budget aims to shift $12 billion from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to the base budget. The OCO is traditionally used for United States presence in turbulent regions like Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe addendum provides an additional $1 billion to USAID\u2019s International Disaster Assistance account for use in humanitarian crises as well as an additional $400 million for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\n\u2014Emily Baumgaertner", "keywords": ["budget", "billion", "white", "request", "funding", "administration", "federal", "million", "department", "house", "spending", "whats", "cut", "medicare"], "polarity": 0.058881258732449225, "subjectivity": 0.3320675576627956},

{"title": "\n                    Obama Portraits Blend Paint and Politics, and Fact and Fiction                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/arts/design/obama-portrait.html", "text": "There are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLansdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fiction", "obamas", "portrait", "black", "fact", "washington", "wiley", "mr", "politics", "ms", "blend", "sherald", "portraits", "paint", "obama"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

The White House is proposing $540 billion in nondefense spending for 2019 \u2014 $57 billion below the new spending cap set by Congress.\n\nThe plan contains at least $1.8 trillion in cuts to federal entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps.\n\nThe White House is proposing to cut funding for a low-income food program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, by more than 30 percent over a decade. It would also impose work requirements for \u201cable bodied\u201d recipients of food stamps and change how they get their benefits, replacing a portion of the coupons that allow them to purchase food at a grocery store with a premade box of \u201c100 percent American grown foods provided directly to households.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s budget proposes allowing public housing authorities and property owners to set minimum work requirements for those in public housing as a way to control costs.\n\nMr. Mulvaney, in his letter, said domestic spending at the levels Congress authorized would add too much to the federal deficit.\n\nInstead, he proposed using about $11 billion of the money to scale back the social safety net by changing the way health entitlement programs are paid for. That would essentially mean getting rid of mandatory programs now funded automatically and without congressional approval, and covering the cost with discretionary funds that could be cut or redirected in the future.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe message, Mr. Mulvaney said, was, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend all of this money, Congress, but if you do, here\u2019s how we would prefer to see you spend it.\u201d\n\nYet for all of the talk of fiscal restraint, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget also amounted to an institutional surrender to the free-spending ways of Capitol Hill, which Mr. Mulvaney said had surprised the president and prompted him to refrain from even bothering to advocate deficit reduction.\n\n\u201cI probably could have made it balance,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney, a former anti-deficit absolutist, said ruefully of his plan on Monday, but \u201cit would have taken funny numbers to do it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan could easily result in much larger federal deficits. The administration made its calculations using assumptions about the United States\u2019 economic trajectory that are more optimistic than the consensus among private-sector forecasters, or the assumptions used by other parts of the government.\n\nThe assumptions in Monday\u2019s release are also significantly more optimistic than the Trump administration itself used in its budget calculations last year.\n\nMost notably, the administration projected annualized economic growth of 3.1 percent over the next three years. In December, the Federal Reserve projected annualized growth of 2.2 percent over that period. The Survey of Professional Forecasters estimated the annualized growth rate to be about 2.4 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The president says the plan will generate as much as $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion in new investments in building roads, bridges and other major projects over the next 10 years, in large part relying on states, cities and private companies to fund them. But the proposal faces steep challenges in Congress, where many lawmakers believe $200 billion is far too little to create a sustainable stream of federal infrastructure money for the future.\n\n\u201cWe will build, we will maintain, and the vast majority of Americans wants to see us take care of our infrastructure,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House as he released an outline of the plan and discussed it with cabinet officials, governors and local leaders. \u201cWashington will no longer be a roadblock to progress; Washington will now be your partner.\u201d\n\nStill, the budget compensates for the new infusion of infrastructure spending in part by slashing existing transportation programs, which would be cut by $178 billion over a decade, according to a detailed budget breakdown the Trump administration sent Monday to Capitol Hill. Grants to Amtrak would be halved, from $1.2 trillion to $538 billion, while the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages vast amounts of public infrastructure projects, would see a more than 20 percent cut.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawmakers in both parties, who essentially went around Mr. Trump to strike their own budget compromise, made it clear they had no intention of embracing Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, denounced \u201cdrastic cuts\u201d to the federal crop insurance program, calling them \u201cill advised.\u201d Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said lawmakers in both parties would once again reject the president\u2019s \u201cdeep cuts\u201d to the State Department and foreign aid.\n\nDemocrats dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal on Monday as a far-fetched plan full of misplaced priorities.\n\n\u201cWhile the president and his O.M.B. director live in budget fantasyland, I will be in the real world negotiating a responsible, bipartisan appropriations package that invests in American families and communities,\u201d remarked Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is utterly astounding that just six weeks after slashing taxes on the wealthy and biggest corporations, creating a huge deficit, the president asks older Americans and middle-class Americans to make up the difference by slashing Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security would receive $46 billion, a $3.4 billion increase over this year\u2019s budget, all part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and build a wall on the southern border with Mexico. The request calls for $18 billion for border security, including $1.6 billion to build about 65 miles of the wall in South Texas. The request also calls for the department to hire 2,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 750 Border Patrol agents.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan would also allocate $13 billion in new spending to tackle opioid abuse through prevention, treatment and recovery support services as well as mental health programs.\n\nThe president is also pressing forward with plans to slash funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, despite Congress\u2019s rejection of a similar plan last year. The budget blueprint would pare the agency by $2.8 billion, or 34 percent from its current level, while eliminating virtually all climate change-related programs. It would also cut the agency\u2019s Office of Science and Technology nearly in half, to $489 million from its current $762 million.\n\nIn outlining the budget, the Trump administration said E.P.A. is refocusing on what it called \u201ccore activities\u201d and eliminating \u201clower priority programs.\u201d That list includes a program to promote partnerships with the private sector to tackle climate change; environmental education training; and an effort to protect marine estuaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House estimated that cutting those programs and others will save taxpayers $600 million compared to last year.", "keywords": ["budget", "programs", "billion", "white", "44", "trump", "plan", "administration", "federal", "mr", "proposes", "deficits", "house", "spending", "trumps", "adds", "trillion"], "polarity": 0.08487339380196525, "subjectivity": 0.3501286676286676},

But Republicans have gradually lost advantages of their own.\n\nSlowly but surely, the considerable structural advantages \u2014 like incumbency, geography and gerrymandering \u2014 that give the Republicans a chance to survive a so-called wave election are fading, giving Democrats a clearer path to a House majority in November.\n\nThe Republicans still retain formidable advantages, enough to win the House while losing the national popular vote by a wide margin. But their edge has shrunk considerably over the last few months, and even more over the last few years.\n\nOne way to think about it is how well Democrats would need to do on the generic ballot \u2014 a poll question that asks voters whether they\u2019ll vote for Democrats or Republicans for Congress \u2014 to win the House. A bigger Republican structural advantage means the G.O.P. can withstand a larger Democratic advantage on the generic ballot.\n\nBy this measure, the Republican advantage has probably dropped by about two percentage points since 2014, when Republicans won the party\u2019s largest House majority since 1929.\n\nSince then, four court rulings have softened or even torn up Republican gerrymanders in four big states: Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and most recently Pennsylvania, where the state Supreme Court struck down the congressional map last month.\n\nThe decisions in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia have already cost the Republicans a net of three House seats while generally eroding their position elsewhere in those states, giving Democrats better opportunities in 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to have a good idea of how much Republicans might lose in Pennsylvania, but it is reasonable to expect that the new map will cost the party at least one seat and erode its position in several others.\n\nGerrymandering is not the only reason Democrats are at a disadvantage. Republicans also have the advantage of incumbency, which, on average, allows members to run about seven percentage points ahead of the national party.\n\nBut Republicans have gradually been losing the advantages of incumbency as well, most obviously because of 34 recent retirements in Republican-held congressional districts.\n\nOver all, the number of G.O.P. retirements in plausibly competitive districts isn\u2019t extraordinarily high. But some of the Republican retirements have been especially damaging: longtime incumbents who have a tradition of running far ahead of the national party and dissuading strong challengers, like New Jersey\u2019s Frank LoBiondo or Pennsylvania\u2019s Charlie Dent. Their retirements could easily be the difference between a non-competitive race and a Democratic victory.\n\nThe Republican incumbency advantage has diminished in another way: Democratic recruitment and fund-raising. A strong Democratic recruit \u2014 like a military veteran or an elected official \u2014 can cut into that advantage, especially with strong fund-raising numbers.\n\nAs measured by biographical indicators like military experience or past elected officials, Democratic recruitment is only somewhat above average at this stage. But much like the Republican retirements, the best Democratic recruits have often been extremely valuable.\n\nOften, Democrats have succeeded in finding their very best candidates in white working-class districts where President Trump fared well in 2016. His strength threatened to move many traditional battlegrounds into the Republican column. The Democratic path to a House majority arguably looked even more difficult after the 2016 presidential than it did before \u2014 even though Democrats picked up seven seats in that election, since so many traditional battleground districts swung hard for Mr. Trump.\n\nBut strong Democratic recruiting in Trump Country has kept many traditional battlegrounds on the list, like Illinois\u2019 12th or Kentucky\u2019s Sixth. The Democrats might have an easier time finding qualified and experienced recruits in white working-class districts in part because Democrats have a track record of winning there, and therefore a deeper bench, even if Mr. Trump won a particular district.\n\nIn contrast, the Democrats don\u2019t have much of a bench at all in many of the well-educated but traditionally Republican districts where Mr. Trump struggled the most. Here it\u2019s the Democratic fund-raising that is most impressive. Last quarter, 134 Democrats in 83 districts raised at least $100,000 in individual contributions. Those successes have been disproportionately concentrated in well-educated areas.\n\nIt\u2019s the working-class districts where Democrats are likeliest to have true recruiting holes, like New York\u2019s 24th or California\u2019s 21st. That might seem somewhat odd because Democrats have had so much success luring top-tier candidates in working-class districts.\n\nIn fact, Democrats do have well-qualified, potential candidates in these districts, like the state assemblyman Rudy Salas or the former Syracuse mayor Stephanie Miner, but many aren\u2019t running. (Mr. Salas hasn\u2019t entered the race in California\u2019s 21, and Ms. Miner has decided not to run in New York\u2019s 24th.) It seems these areas may not be stocked with ambitious, well-to-do and well-connected liberals eager to run when an elected official doesn\u2019t step forward.\n\nEven so, Democrats still seem poised to have viable if imperfect candidates in a large number of battleground districts. Upshot estimates indicate that Democrats would need to win the popular vote by 7.4 points \u2014 albeit with a healthy margin of error of plus or minus more than four points \u2014 to take the House. Today, most estimates put the generic congressional ballot very near that number. So far from the election, the fight for control remains a tossup.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot. He covers elections, polling and demographics.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fiction", "obamas", "portrait", "black", "fact", "washington", "wiley", "mr", "politics", "ms", "blend", "sherald", "portraits", "paint", "obama"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now. People can\u2019t go back and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s going to be too hard, it\u2019s Africa.\u201d They can\u2019t do that. And that is so thrilling to me.\n\nMICHAEL B. JORDAN It couldn\u2019t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it\u2019s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody\u2019s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn\u2019t think were lucrative, didn\u2019t think that anybody wanted to see. All of that, I feel, is getting ready to dissolve.\n\nBOSEMAN It has to.\n\nGURIRA No, it will.\n\nCOOGLER What I\u2019ll say is, this is my second time working in the studio system, and they say it\u2019s the studio system, but it\u2019s really the people system. It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. And I think he\u2019s delivered a movie that\u2019s going to do that, and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies you\u2019ve done?\n\nBOSEMAN I\u2019ve done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past, but this not only refers to the past, it sets the stage for where we\u2019re going.\n\nGURIRA I\u2019ve had a passion for telling African stories for a really long time, being American-born and Zimbabwe-raised. That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan \u2014 I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you\u2019re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, \u201cOh wow, we\u2019re all in it together? And y\u2019all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel. [Ms. Nyong\u2019o was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents and raised in Kenya.]\n\nPhoto\n\nBOSEMAN A lot of times, being [a black man] in Hollywood, when you get material you\u2019ll read it and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not us.\u201d When I got the initial call from Kevin Feige, my hope was that they would have the courage to give Black Panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be. And they did that.\n\nOn set, did you have that feeling of \u201cThis is important\u201d or did you just try to do good work like normal?\n\nCOOGLER I learned a skill from playing football. I was a wide receiver \u2014 they throw you the ball, you can\u2019t drop it. So I learned that you gotta tune everything else out.\n\nIf I get to set and there\u2019s a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and Lupita is dressed in this adornment and Danai is dressed in this adornment and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey Ryan, do I stand here or here?\u201d I can\u2019t think, \u201cAh, this is amazing, I\u2019m making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and there\u2019s all these black folks on screen!\u201d I really gotta tell Danai that she needs to move over here, and I gotta tell her five reasons why she\u2019s gotta move over here, because she\u2019s gonna wanna know \u2019em! [Laughter]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that I\u2019m making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t be no good to anybody.\n\nNYONG\u2019O A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg\u2019s] \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn that moment, I was like, \u201cThis is big.\u201d I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.\n\nMichael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killmonger\u2019s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T\u2019Challa\u2019s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?\n\nJORDAN Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost. He doesn\u2019t know who he is, but he knows the answers are out there.\n\nBOSEMAN For me, [Killmonger and T\u2019Challa] are two sides of the same coin \u2014 African and African-American. As an African-American, if you\u2019re disconnected from your ancestry and your past, you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that.\n\nCOOGLER The fracture that Killmonger has, that\u2019s the fracture I lived with my whole life. I\u2019m from a place that I\u2019d never been to and that nobody who I loved had been to because they couldn\u2019t afford to go [to Africa. Mr. Coogler grew up in Richmond in Northern California]. So I would hear stories from them about this place that they didn\u2019t even know anything about, and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the movie, Wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world, and white people who aren\u2019t in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. That\u2019s a very real view that a lot of people hold about Africa, as recent comments attributed to the president made clear. What do you hope will be the effect of introducing audiences to this counternarrative about the continent?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCOOGLER The narrative about the continent that we know is actually a fairly recent narrative, if you think about human history. It\u2019s a narrative that was born out of what happened when the countries of Africa were conquered.\n\nBut the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters \u2014 and these recent comments definitely aren\u2019t the first time somebody has said something like that \u2014 were the cradle of civilization. They were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized.\n\nAll the structures that we built in Wakanda, they\u2019re taller structures of what you\u2019ll find in Africa. Some of them we switched up \u2014 instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium \u2014 but those are buildings that you\u2019ll really find in Mali, in Ethiopia, in Nigeria.\n\nI spent about three weeks in Africa [doing research for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d] and I truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["gillespies", "white", "ads", "mr", "ms13", "vote", "democrats", "republicans", "immigration", "virginia", "voters", "win"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["movement", "black", "white", "lives", "harlem", "blacks", "showed", "america", "renaissance", "matter", "americans"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["bell", "company", "campaign", "africa", "pottinger", "main", "rogues", "guptas", "reading", "mr", "pr", "firm", "end", "south", "met", "despots"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["womens", "power", "whitesupremacist", "white", "racial", "men", "supremacy", "women", "politics", "work", "american"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration. Students must be in the same classrooms, have the same quality of teachers and be disciplined in the same way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees. Last week, at a meeting in Budapest of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of central European nations, Mr. Orban said, \u201cWe do not wish to become a destination country for migrants.\u201d\n\nThe media here has offered widespread support to Mr. Okovacs for bringing back a popular production after decades. Origo, a government-friendly news website, published an article with the headline \u201cOnly blacks used to be able to perform this opera because of racist restrictions.\u201d And the online theater magazine szinhaz.hu welcomed what it referred to as the Hungarian State Opera\u2019s \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d by staging the opera with \u201cits excellent Hungarian singers.\u201d\n\nMany conservative columnists, including in the daily Magyar Nemzet, have denounced the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d of performing the opera only with a black cast. \u201cPolitical correctness is slowly devouring aesthetics,\u201d one columnist said.\n\nThe director of the production, Andras Almasi-Toth, told szinhaz.huthat \u201cwhile performance and staging solutions have progressed \u2014 we play, sing and stage Puccini differently from 50 years ago \u2014 this opera was left out, which makes for a very sterile production. It can only take place on Catfish Row in the 1930s, which gives it a fairy-tale like quality, devoid of its real-life aspects.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Ronald Crutcher, an African-American music scholar and president of the University of Richmond, said that he thought the idea of transplanting \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d to somewhere other than Catfish Row was \u201cfascinating\u201d but added that \u201cthe whole notion of recasting the story as an immigrant struggle is hard to imagine. It\u2019s an iconic piece that was written at a critically important time, particularly in America,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut awareness of this is limited here in Hungary. Adam Kertesz, 69, an academic who was in the audience for Saturday\u2019s premiere, said he was unfamiliar with the opera\u2019s historical context. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about all that,\u201d Mr. Kertesz said. \u201cI just love the music.

The message was seemingly a response to comments the hip-hop artist and businessman made during an interview with CNN on Saturday night.\n\nVan Jones, the CNN correspondent who conducted the interview with Jay-Z (here\u2019s a transcript), made his own statement on Twitter, pointing out that Jay-Z was acknowledging the low unemployment numbers.\n\nMr. Trump has referred to the unemployment rate at least three other times recently on his Twitter account. He also cited it during his speech at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump is right. Black unemployment in the United States reached its lowest level in December. But, as my colleague Linda Qiu reported two weeks ago, the record is the culmination of a longer trend, and there has been no shift in the larger racial unemployment gap:\n\nThe 6.8 percent unemployment rate for black Americans in December is indeed the lowest since 1972, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets \u2014 as Mr. Trump suggests.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s an open question whether a president can claim credit for economic outputs like unemployment. As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained:\n\nSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no. If you think that what really matters is the mood in the executive suite, then just maybe.\n\nJay-Z is scheduled to appear at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Trump\u2019s religious champions, Michael Gerson writes in The Washington Post, are \u201cassociating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception. They are playing a grubby political game for the highest of stakes: the reputation of their faith.\u201d\n\nI sympathize with his distress. But the politicized sectors of conservative evangelicalism have been associated with bigotry, selfishness and deception for a long time. Trump has simply revealed the movement\u2019s priorities. It values the preservation of traditional racial and sexual hierarchies over fuzzier notions of wholesomeness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve resisted throughout my career the notion that evangelicals are racist, I really have,\u201d Balmer told me. \u201cBut I think the 2016 election demonstrated that the religious right was circling back to the founding principles of the movement. What happened in 2016 is that the religious right dropped all pretense that theirs was a movement about family values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is one reason I find it hard to take seriously religious conservatives who say they are being persecuted for their defense of traditional marriage. People who are sympathetic to Christian, conservative Trump supporters \u2014 even if they don\u2019t support Trump themselves \u2014 will say that they\u2019ve been backed into a corner by the expansion of civil rights laws and policies protecting gay people. As they see it, liberals not only won the culture war on gay marriage but now are also demanding that private redoubts of resistance be brought into line.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 gay-marriage decision, Rod Dreher, a social-conservative Trump critic, wrote, \u201cPost-Obergefell, Christians who hold to the biblical teaching about sex and marriage have the same status in culture, and increasingly in law, as racists.\u201d\n\nDreher obviously thinks they deserve much better. He sees a fundamental difference between Christians who thought their religious freedom was trampled by desegregation and Christians who think their religious freedom is trampled when their business and charities have to serve gay people.\n\nBut it seems absurd to ask secular people to respect the religious right\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage \u2014 and thus tolerate a degree of anti-gay discrimination \u2014 while the movement\u2019s leaders treat their own sexual standards as flexible and conditional.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830. She takes readers along on her research journey through disparate records, but ultimately concludes that Harriet Hemings \u201cwill keep her secret.\u201d\n\nThe last chapter, \u201cLegacies,\u201d ruminates on the fate of each of the women from a contemporary perspective. Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day. And Harriet, who passed as white, most likely abandoning her family in the process, prompts Kerrison to wonder about the persistence of racism in American society.

His tactics in Birmingham were geared toward maximum media impact. Marches were scheduled to accommodate the evening news \u2014 and when recruits were scarce, Mr. Walker counted on spectators to inflate the white newsmen\u2019s troop count. (\u201cMarchers, spectators?\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cTo them we all looked alike.\u201d) He finessed a call from President Kennedy to Coretta Scott King when her husband was jailed, and came up with the idea for King to write his jailhouse epistle. His efforts to get \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d published didn\u2019t bear fruit until the campaign succeeded.\n\nMost important, Mr. Walker had known from the start that mass moral witnesses, such as the nonviolent marches led by praying ministers, would not be enough to turn public opinion against segregation and get the desired federal intervention. He would need the segregationists to act out visually the violence and evil at the system\u2019s core. When Mr. Connor briefly deployed the German Shepherds in early April, Mr. Walker exulted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs.\u201d Within a month, he got his picture, and King the credit for bringing down American apartheid.\n\nThirty-six years later in New York, March 1999, I was struck by echoes of Birmingham in the protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the unpunished police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. A photograph of one of the protesters \u2014 Mr. Giuliani\u2019s predecessor David Dinkins, New York\u2019s first and so far only black mayor \u2014 who was cuffed along with Representative Charles Rangel, reminded me especially of a picture of King and his deputy Ralph Abernathy being arrested in Birmingham on Good Friday, 1963. It didn\u2019t surprise me to discover Mr. Walker\u2019s fingerprints all over these electrifying demonstrations. He was at the time on the board of the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, which organized the protests.\n\nTwo years later, when my book on Birmingham came out, I brought a magazine photographer to Mr. Walker\u2019s church to take our picture. He fixed me with his perfectionist glare and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you journalists that makes you think Dr. King was so namby-pamby.\u201d\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Walker was nine years ago, at a King holiday event in Dallas. He had retired from Harlem\u2019s Canaan Baptist and moved to Virginia in the aftermath of strokes that left him dependent on a wheelchair and incapable of much facial expression, though his eyes still radiated trouble and his mouth still delivered the gibes.\n\nWe clutched hands in front of a TV, watching the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States.

At the S.C.L.C., he devised a structured fund-raising strategy and organized numerous protests, including a series of anti-segregation boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., that came to be known as Project C.\n\nThe C stood for \u201cconfrontation,\u201d and the project is regarded as the blueprint for the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South.\n\n\u201cThe federal government was against us, the local communities were against us, the judges were against us, but we managed to do it, and I guess we found the strength to do it because it was a moral fight,\u201d Dr. Walker said in an interview for this obituary in 2006.\n\n\u201cI was fully committed to nonviolence, and I believe with all my heart that for the civil rights movement to prove itself, its nonviolent actions had to work in Birmingham,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Birmingham, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Selma march, there wouldn\u2019t have been a 1965 civil rights bill. Birmingham was the birthplace and affirmation of the nonviolent movement in America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker helped circulate \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important documents of the civil rights movement, in which Dr. King argued for civil disobedience as a legitimate response to racial segregation. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nPhoto\n\nScholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201d\n\nWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.\n\nWhen Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.\n\nBut the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he used cardboard to cover holes in the soles of his shoes. Five siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe received his master of divinity degree from Union three years later. He also held a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester. (The Crozer seminary in Pennsylvania had merged with Colgate Rochester in 1970.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. His photography was also the subject of exhibits.\n\nOrdained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.\n\nIn Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

He then moved to Virginia to be closer to relatives.\n\nDr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.\n\nDuring his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.\n\nIn 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.\n\nFor Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fiction", "obamas", "portrait", "black", "fact", "washington", "wiley", "mr", "politics", "ms", "blend", "sherald", "portraits", "paint", "obama"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

The film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter, according to the online vendor Fandango, surpassing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the 2017 live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\nThe morning after a red-carpet premiere in Hollywood last month that left Twitter swooning, the stars, director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the African diaspora on screen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda; Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Nakia, a Wakandan spy and T\u2019Challa\u2019s love interest); Michael B.

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nI read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations.\n\n[Rolling laughter]\n\nCHADWICK BOSEMAN I still want my reparations! I still want my reparations!\n\nRYAN COOGLER [laughing] I think only reparations can be reparations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s silly, but is there a kernel of truth there for any of you? The idea that Disney and Marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution?\n\nDANAI GURIRA What it does in such a beautiful way, to me, is it sets a precedent. We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now. People can\u2019t go back and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s going to be too hard, it\u2019s Africa.\u201d They can\u2019t do that. And that is so thrilling to me.\n\nMICHAEL B.

It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe.

That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan \u2014 I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you\u2019re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, \u201cOh wow, we\u2019re all in it together? And y\u2019all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel.

And they did that.\n\nOn set, did you have that feeling of \u201cThis is important\u201d or did you just try to do good work like normal?\n\nCOOGLER I learned a skill from playing football.

[Laughter]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that I\u2019m making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t be no good to anybody.\n\nNYONG\u2019O A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg\u2019s] \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn that moment, I was like, \u201cThis is big.\u201d I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.\n\nMichael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killmonger\u2019s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T\u2019Challa\u2019s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?\n\nJORDAN Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost. He doesn\u2019t know who he is, but he knows the answers are out there.\n\nBOSEMAN For me, [Killmonger and T\u2019Challa] are two sides of the same coin \u2014 African and African-American. As an African-American, if you\u2019re disconnected from your ancestry and your past, you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that.\n\nCOOGLER The fracture that Killmonger has, that\u2019s the fracture I lived with my whole life. I\u2019m from a place that I\u2019d never been to and that nobody who I loved had been to because they couldn\u2019t afford to go [to Africa. Mr. Coogler grew up in Richmond in Northern California]. So I would hear stories from them about this place that they didn\u2019t even know anything about, and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the movie, Wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world, and white people who aren\u2019t in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. That\u2019s a very real view that a lot of people hold about Africa, as recent comments attributed to the president made clear. What do you hope will be the effect of introducing audiences to this counternarrative about the continent?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCOOGLER The narrative about the continent that we know is actually a fairly recent narrative, if you think about human history. It\u2019s a narrative that was born out of what happened when the countries of Africa were conquered.\n\nBut the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters \u2014 and these recent comments definitely aren\u2019t the first time somebody has said something like that \u2014 were the cradle of civilization. They were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized.\n\nAll the structures that we built in Wakanda, they\u2019re taller structures of what you\u2019ll find in Africa. Some of them we switched up \u2014 instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium \u2014 but those are buildings that you\u2019ll really find in Mali, in Ethiopia, in Nigeria.\n\nI spent about three weeks in Africa [doing research for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d] and I truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["gillespies", "white", "ads", "mr", "ms13", "vote", "democrats", "republicans", "immigration", "virginia", "voters", "win"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["movement", "black", "white", "lives", "harlem", "blacks", "showed", "america", "renaissance", "matter", "americans"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["bell", "company", "campaign", "africa", "pottinger", "main", "rogues", "guptas", "reading", "mr", "pr", "firm", "end", "south", "met", "despots"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["womens", "power", "whitesupremacist", "white", "racial", "men", "supremacy", "women", "politics", "work", "american"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees.

It can only take place on Catfish Row in the 1930s, which gives it a fairy-tale like quality, devoid of its real-life aspects.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Ronald Crutcher, an African-American music scholar and president of the University of Richmond, said that he thought the idea of transplanting \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d to somewhere other than Catfish Row was \u201cfascinating\u201d but added that \u201cthe whole notion of recasting the story as an immigrant struggle is hard to imagine. It\u2019s an iconic piece that was written at a critically important time, particularly in America,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut awareness of this is limited here in Hungary. Adam Kertesz, 69, an academic who was in the audience for Saturday\u2019s premiere, said he was unfamiliar with the opera\u2019s historical context. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about all that,\u201d Mr. Kertesz said. \u201cI just love the music. I saw the 1983 production of \u2018Porgy\u2019 here.

The message was seemingly a response to comments the hip-hop artist and businessman made during an interview with CNN on Saturday night.\n\nVan Jones, the CNN correspondent who conducted the interview with Jay-Z (here\u2019s a transcript), made his own statement on Twitter, pointing out that Jay-Z was acknowledging the low unemployment numbers.\n\nMr. Trump has referred to the unemployment rate at least three other times recently on his Twitter account. He also cited it during his speech at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump is right. Black unemployment in the United States reached its lowest level in December. But, as my colleague Linda Qiu reported two weeks ago, the record is the culmination of a longer trend, and there has been no shift in the larger racial unemployment gap:\n\nThe 6.8 percent unemployment rate for black Americans in December is indeed the lowest since 1972, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets \u2014 as Mr. Trump suggests.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s an open question whether a president can claim credit for economic outputs like unemployment. As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained:\n\nSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no. If you think that what really matters is the mood in the executive suite, then just maybe.\n\nJay-Z is scheduled to appear at the Grammy Awards on Sunday night.

Trump\u2019s religious champions, Michael Gerson writes in The Washington Post, are \u201cassociating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception. They are playing a grubby political game for the highest of stakes: the reputation of their faith.\u201d\n\nI sympathize with his distress. But the politicized sectors of conservative evangelicalism have been associated with bigotry, selfishness and deception for a long time. Trump has simply revealed the movement\u2019s priorities. It values the preservation of traditional racial and sexual hierarchies over fuzzier notions of wholesomeness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve resisted throughout my career the notion that evangelicals are racist, I really have,\u201d Balmer told me. \u201cBut I think the 2016 election demonstrated that the religious right was circling back to the founding principles of the movement. What happened in 2016 is that the religious right dropped all pretense that theirs was a movement about family values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is one reason I find it hard to take seriously religious conservatives who say they are being persecuted for their defense of traditional marriage. People who are sympathetic to Christian, conservative Trump supporters \u2014 even if they don\u2019t support Trump themselves \u2014 will say that they\u2019ve been backed into a corner by the expansion of civil rights laws and policies protecting gay people. As they see it, liberals not only won the culture war on gay marriage but now are also demanding that private redoubts of resistance be brought into line.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 gay-marriage decision, Rod Dreher, a social-conservative Trump critic, wrote, \u201cPost-Obergefell, Christians who hold to the biblical teaching about sex and marriage have the same status in culture, and increasingly in law, as racists.\u201d\n\nDreher obviously thinks they deserve much better. He sees a fundamental difference between Christians who thought their religious freedom was trampled by desegregation and Christians who think their religious freedom is trampled when their business and charities have to serve gay people.\n\nBut it seems absurd to ask secular people to respect the religious right\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage \u2014 and thus tolerate a degree of anti-gay discrimination \u2014 while the movement\u2019s leaders treat their own sexual standards as flexible and conditional.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830. She takes readers along on her research journey through disparate records, but ultimately concludes that Harriet Hemings \u201cwill keep her secret.\u201d\n\nThe last chapter, \u201cLegacies,\u201d ruminates on the fate of each of the women from a contemporary perspective. Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day. And Harriet, who passed as white, most likely abandoning her family in the process, prompts Kerrison to wonder about the persistence of racism in American society.

His tactics in Birmingham were geared toward maximum media impact. Marches were scheduled to accommodate the evening news \u2014 and when recruits were scarce, Mr. Walker counted on spectators to inflate the white newsmen\u2019s troop count. (\u201cMarchers, spectators?\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cTo them we all looked alike.\u201d) He finessed a call from President Kennedy to Coretta Scott King when her husband was jailed, and came up with the idea for King to write his jailhouse epistle. His efforts to get \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d published didn\u2019t bear fruit until the campaign succeeded.\n\nMost important, Mr. Walker had known from the start that mass moral witnesses, such as the nonviolent marches led by praying ministers, would not be enough to turn public opinion against segregation and get the desired federal intervention. He would need the segregationists to act out visually the violence and evil at the system\u2019s core. When Mr. Connor briefly deployed the German Shepherds in early April, Mr. Walker exulted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs.\u201d Within a month, he got his picture, and King the credit for bringing down American apartheid.\n\nThirty-six years later in New York, March 1999, I was struck by echoes of Birmingham in the protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the unpunished police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. A photograph of one of the protesters \u2014 Mr. Giuliani\u2019s predecessor David Dinkins, New York\u2019s first and so far only black mayor \u2014 who was cuffed along with Representative Charles Rangel, reminded me especially of a picture of King and his deputy Ralph Abernathy being arrested in Birmingham on Good Friday, 1963. It didn\u2019t surprise me to discover Mr. Walker\u2019s fingerprints all over these electrifying demonstrations. He was at the time on the board of the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, which organized the protests.\n\nTwo years later, when my book on Birmingham came out, I brought a magazine photographer to Mr. Walker\u2019s church to take our picture. He fixed me with his perfectionist glare and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you journalists that makes you think Dr. King was so namby-pamby.\u201d\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Walker was nine years ago, at a King holiday event in Dallas.

Wyatt Tee Walker, who was chief of staff to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a key strategist behind civil rights protests that turned the tide against racial injustice in the Jim Crow South of the 1960s, died early on Tuesday at an assisted-living facility near his home in Chester, Va. He was 88.\n\nHis death was announced by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Dr. Walker was the organization\u2019s first board chairman of the National Action Network, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s organization.\n\nDr. Walker preached against intolerance and racial inequality for six decades from pulpits across the South, in New York City and in five of the world\u2019s seven continents. He helped supervise South Africa\u2019s first fully representative elections in 1994, when Nelson Mandela\u2019s rise to power ushered in the end of the apartheid regime.\n\nBut much of his impact was felt closer to home. For 37 years he was a towering community figure as the pastor at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem, and from 1965 to 1975 he was a special assistant on urban affairs to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York. In both posts he was a strong advocate of affordable housing and better schools in the low-income neighborhoods of Upper Manhattan.\n\nDr. Walker\u2019s work as a civil rights advocate began in 1953, soon after he finished his graduate studies at the historically black Virginia Union University in Richmond. He had met Dr. King while both were students.\n\nThe two had been presidents of their classes \u2014 Dr. King at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania \u2014 and they had their first encounter during an inter-seminary meeting.\n\nDr. Walker joined the fledgling Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1961 and served until 1964 as its executive director and, unofficially, as Dr. King\u2019s right-hand man. At the S.C.L.C., he devised a structured fund-raising strategy and organized numerous protests, including a series of anti-segregation boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., that came to be known as Project C.\n\nThe C stood for \u201cconfrontation,\u201d and the project is regarded as the blueprint for the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South.\n\n\u201cThe federal government was against us, the local communities were against us, the judges were against us, but we managed to do it, and I guess we found the strength to do it because it was a moral fight,\u201d Dr. Walker said in an interview for this obituary in 2006.\n\n\u201cI was fully committed to nonviolence, and I believe with all my heart that for the civil rights movement to prove itself, its nonviolent actions had to work in Birmingham,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Birmingham, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Selma march, there wouldn\u2019t have been a 1965 civil rights bill. Birmingham was the birthplace and affirmation of the nonviolent movement in America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker helped circulate \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important documents of the civil rights movement, in which Dr. King argued for civil disobedience as a legitimate response to racial segregation. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nImage In April 1970, Dr. Walker preached a Sunday sermon through a bullhorn outside Teen City, a Harlem pizza parlor that was notorious as a drug-trafficking den. \u201cWe are trying to save our children,\u201d he said, then turned his bullhorn toward tenements across the street. \u201cYou, up there in the windows,\u201d he said, \"tell your kids to keep out of Teen City.\u201d Credit Michael Evans/The New York Times\n\nScholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.\n\nA March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\nAfrican American Legends: Rev. Wyatt T. Walker on the Civil Rights Movement Credit Video by cunytv75\n\n\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201d\n\nWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.\n\nWhen Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.\n\nBut the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he used cardboard to cover holes in the soles of his shoes. Five siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.\n\nImage Dr. Walker in 1998.

He also held a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester. (The Crozer seminary in Pennsylvania had merged with Colgate Rochester in 1970.)\n\nAn authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. His photography was also the subject of exhibits.\n\nOrdained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.\n\nIn Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nDr. Walker worked for the S.C.L.C. in Atlanta for four years before moving to Harlem, in 1965, when he was named pulpit minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church.\n\nTwo years later, he became pastor and chief executive of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, a post he held until a series of strokes forced him to retire in 2004. He then moved to Virginia to be closer to relatives.\n\nThe Official Tony Brown's Journal -- Rev. Wyatt T Walker Credit Video by Tony Brown\n\nDr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.\n\nDuring his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.\n\nIn 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.\n\nFor Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations. It was tough to frighten me, because I was so convinced that God would take care of me.\u201d\n\nCorrection : An earlier version of this obituary misstated the location of Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, where Dr. Walker was the pastor for many years. It is at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue in Harlem \u2014 not at 115th Street between St. Nicholas and Lenox Avenues. William McDonald and Daniel E.
