She was the only woman and person of color to graduate from her University of Virginia Medical School\u2019s Class of 1967, and most notably, she went on to become the director of the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health at the National Institutes of Health, a position she retired from in 2011.\n\n\u201cAnd to then think,\u201d Pinn continued, \u201cthat more than 50 years later, I\u2019d come back here [Charlottesville, Va.] to see a major building with my name on it is pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2017, UVA renamed the medical education and research building (formerly known as Jordan Hall) Pinn Hall (schedule conflicts delayed the change that was initially planned for 2016).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s amazing indeed, given the past and present context of race relations in Charlottesville. Just one month earlier, torch-toting racists, Klansmen and Confederate sympathizers marched on the University of Virginia\u2019s campus there during a deadly weekend of protests around the removal of a Confederate monument. Three people died before that rally ended.\n\nThe built environment is so much more than shelter, urban planning and architecture\u2014it reflects our very commitment to democracy. Our statues are monuments to the state of our democracy as much as they honor our beloved. Our willingness to take down racist traitors also signifies.\n\nTo be clear, Confederate monuments are a myopic aggrandizement of a warped historical narrative\u2014a storyline that rationalizes past and present oppression. White House chief of staff John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, no less, perpetuated the Confederate fable in an interview last week by saying that Robert E. Lee, the traitor who fought against the Union and whose statue was at the center of the protest in Charlottesville, was an \u201chonorable man\u201d and that the Civil War was brought about by a \u201clack of an ability to compromise.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUVA has come a long way in honoring Pinn, but the calamities that transpired a month earlier in Charlottesville show how much further our democracy has to go.\n\n\u201cI hope the image of my name on a building is not seen as a representation of my personal accomplishment,\u201d said Pinn. \u201cI hope it represents inspiration for black women who face similar battles today to what I dealt with in the past.\u201d\n\nShe knows that her success, while important, cannot substitute for social change that goes beyond individual acceptance and assimilation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a black woman, Pinn navigated a white, male-dominated field to serve her country by literally healing victims of physical and social ailments at the NIH.\n\nIt\u2019s more than a notion to think that racism and sexism kill more people than diabetes. Middle-class, educated black women exhibit worse health outcomes than their white peers. Black women can\u2019t educate or buy their way to better health outcomes, because racism and sexism are like airborne pollutants, affecting everyone who comes in contact with them.\n\nWe have to change the social, political and, yes, the built environment that reflects our world, to improve conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUVA, a public university, rightly showed gratitude to Pinn and democracy by naming a building after an authentic hero.\n\nPinn trained hundreds of physicians in her academic appointments at Howard University College of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Tufts University. As a director at NIH, she mentored researchers and advanced policies that would improve outcomes for women. As past president of the National Medical Association, a nonprofit professional organization representing black doctors and their patients, she projected the voice of disenfranchised communities.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how much worse off women would be without Pinn\u2019s life\u2019s work, which gets us closer to a more perfect union. We need that UVA hall to bear Pinn\u2019s name, to remind us of the values we should honor and celebrate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fight around monuments is an extension of blacks\u2019 perpetual struggle with claiming space\u2014our existential battle for control and representation. From our resistance against highways being built on top of black communities to shuttle whites into suburbs to whites gentrifying formerly redlined districts, the fight to claim space and democracy goes well beyond which monuments are taken down.\n\n\n\nTake \u2019Em Down NOLA, a group instrumental in the removal of four Confederate monuments in New Orleans, also demands that the city of New Orleans \u201cdevelop a community-driven process [emphasis our own] for the removal of the monuments and the choosing of their replacements,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacing death threats and other acts of intimidation, such activists should be considered modern-day heroes worthy of more than a page in the history books. It\u2019s past time we made room in public spaces for people who actually deserve our respect. The removal of Confederate monuments from public spaces isn\u2019t about erasing history; it\u2019s about honoring the people who make it.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["pinn", "democracy", "uva", "honors", "university", "women", "confederate", "removal", "past", "vivian", "magic", "replacing", "fables", "medical", "monuments", "black", "blackgirl"], "polarity": 0.09348519388413003, "subjectivity": 0.3459384882257224},

About 5,360 people participated in the large-sample poll.\n\nRespondents were asked to express varying levels of agreement or disagreement with different prompts. They also had the option of selecting a neutral answer, \u201cNeither agree nor disagree,\u201d as well as \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAttacks on White People\n\nA central tenet of white nationalism is the belief that white people are under attack in this country, whether it be by losing their status as a majority group (this is the basis of so-called white genocide) or by perceived \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, 39 percent of respondents agreed to some extent that white people were currently \u201cunder attack\u201d in the U.S. Only 29 percent of white people disagreed with the statement, compared with more than half of nonwhites (54 percent).\n\nNearly a third of total respondents (31 percent) agreed that the country needs to \u201cprotect and preserve its White European heritage.\u201d The percentage of people who disagreed was only slightly higher at 34 percent.\n\nThere was also a clear partisan divide.\n\nA strong majority of Republicans agreed to some extent that white people are under attack in this country (63 percent), which isn\u2019t altogether surprising given the racially charged\u2014and just outright racist\u2014rhetoric the GOP has employed through the years. But while the rate of Democrats who agreed that whites are under attack was comparatively low, at 21 percent, that still indicates that a fifth of \u201cprogressive\u201d respondents subscribe to one of the so-called alt-right\u2019s core beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport for Black Lives Matter\n\nMost of the survey\u2019s respondents felt that \u201call races should be treated equally\u201d (89 percent) and that people of different races should be allowed to live wherever they choose (70 percent).\n\nBut survey participants didn\u2019t express that same positivity toward Black Lives Matter, a group that advocates for the fair and equal treatment of black people under the law. Less than a third of respondents said they supported the organization\u2014an additional 24 percent said they had neutral feelings about the group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the percentage of people who opposed Black Lives Matter (37 percent) was similar to those who opposed anti-fascists, or antifa (39 percent).\n\nKeeping Confederate Monuments in Place\n\nConfederate monuments throughout the U.S. have become a cultural flashpoint. As for white supremacists, preserving these statues is central to their drive to \u201cprotect and preserve\u201d white European heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe majority of total respondents\u2014three-fifths\u2014expressed that Confederate monuments should remain in public spaces, compared with a quarter who said they should be removed.\n\nMore than half of black Americans said that the statues should be taken down (54 percent), but a greater portion of white people (67 percent) indicated that the monuments should stay in place.\n\n\u201cNeutral in the Face of Oppression\u201d\n\n\n\nThe UVA report notes that the amount of \u201cmiddling\u201d answers\u2014that is, respondents who neither agreed nor disagreed with statements\u2014was striking, especially given today\u2019s polarized political climate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the Ipso pollsters, Julia Clark, noted that neutrality isn\u2019t quite what it appears on first glance. Clark said that this particular group was more likely to lean \u201ctoward intolerance than away from it.\u201d\n\nFor example, she said, neutral respondents were \u201cfar less likely to condemn statements against interracial marriage and in favor of preserving white heritage.\u201d They were also \u201cnotably less likely\u201d to express that people of color were under attack, or that all races should be treated equally.\n\n\u201cIn both cases, and others,\u201d said Clark, \u201cthis makes their viewpoints more congruous with extremist, anti-equality views than more-progressive views.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more, including the report and its full results and methodology, at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.", "keywords": ["total", "agreed", "monuments", "white", "sharing", "respondents", "black", "races", "neutral", "poll", "finds", "supremacistseven", "views", "attack", "oppose", "majority", "supremacist"], "polarity": 0.07276106453321644, "subjectivity": 0.355552815679398},

No one gets any work done anyway, he said, so why not just give everyone those two days off? This was not the first and will not be the last time I'll hear someone make a similar joke. March Madness will have such a grip on our country in the next couple of weeks that, while it'll never, ever, ever happen, it's not completely illogical to give everyone a few days off of work. The joke is also accidentally apropos. What better, more American way to honor this annual celebration of athletes working for free than to not work and still get paid?\n\nAh yes. You knew it was coming. Just as the NCAA tournament receives our national focus, this is also the time of the year where the discussion about student-athletes getting paid reaches a critical mass. It often goes the same way. A smart take on the NCAA will publish on The Atlantic or Grantland or Deadspin. The ridiculous amount of money made from the NCAA tournament (not sure of the exact amount, but I think it's roughly $17 trillion an hour) will get cited, as well as all the people making millions (the schools, the coaches, the school administrations, etc) off of the labor of the athletes who see none of that cash. Sure, the piece will also note, athletes get a free college education. But then it'll also include the fact that saying \"Hey, we gave you something that's worth $40,000 for free!\" while cashing a $17 trillion dollar check is like, I don't know, someone saying \"A tsunami is about to hit our island. Can you help?\" and someone else saying \"Well, here's an umbrella.\" Also, the piece will cite the numerous academic scandals at high profile universities as more proof that many of these trillion dollar check cashing schools have no interest in making sure their athletes actually receive an education. It might even mention that \"four year scholarships\" are actually one year renewable. Meaning that an athlete's scholarship can get revoked after one year for any reason. And, if it mentions that, it might cite example of athletes dropped from their scholarships because of injury or because the coach just needed an extra scholarship to give to someone else.\n\nSome people will listen to this conversation and agree that this is an injustice. They'll concede that student-athletes are being exploited and should be allowed to receive some sort of compensation for their work. We'll call these people Group A. Today, as these types of conversations about the NCAA seem to be more prevalent, Group A seems to be growing. I don't have any numbers in front of me, but it feels like there are more people in 2015 in favor of student-athletes receiving compensation than there would have been in 1995.\n\nHowever, three groups still remain strong.\n\nGroup B: The people who agree that student-athletes are being exploited, but just don't give a fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGroup C: The people who do not agree that student-athletes are being exploited, and believe that a free college education is acceptable compensation. They also don't give a fuck, but their don't-give-a-fuckness is principle-driven.\n\nGroup D: The people who stand to profit from the NCAA's current economic model, and do not want any change.\n\nOf these, Group D is both the most hypocritical and the most understandable. If your income is directly tied to other's lack of income, it makes perfect sense why you'd be invested in the status quo. Group B and Group C, however, make less sense. Especially when considering that these are often otherwise intelligent and thoughtful people who recognize inequality and injustice in other ways but, for whatever reason, have a blind spot when it comes to college athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it makes less logical sense. Emotional sense, however, is different. And this is where the blind spot comes from.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of NCAA sports, football and men's basketball are the ones at the center of this conversation. NCAA football and men's basketball teams are filled with 18 to 22 year old young men. Many of whom are Black, some of whom would not be anywhere close to a college campus if not for sports, and all of whom were stars in high school and are likely among the preferred class of students in college. Being part of the preferred class of college students means they receive lots of perks; some social (women, automatic elevated social status, etc) and some academic (free books, better meal plans, first dibs with class and dorm selections, etc). And, on top of that, they go to school for free! Basically, their lives seem to be much better than the lives of 99% of college students. And, because their lives seem to be much better than the lives of 99% of college students, some people \u2014 often people who were part of that 99% \u2014 have a very difficult time conjuring much sympathy for any type of \"injustice\" they might be facing.\n\nWhen you think about this, it makes sense why some of these same people could refuse to buy Nikes or shop at Walmart because of how they treat their workforce, but have no fucks left to give about college athletes getting exploited. It's the exact same concept, the only difference being that the Walmart workers and the people in the Nike sweatshops are presumed to be poor and powerless while supporting NCAA reform means you're basically saying that you're in favor of this 6'3, 220 pound superstar athlete with free classes, free tutors, free food, free pussy, and free social status also getting paid. But, that only difference is a huge fucking difference. Maybe not logically. But emotionally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the bright side, March is already halfway over. Which means we're all a couple weeks away from giving absolutely no fucks about this conversation for another 11 months. In the mean time, fill out those brackets.

We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, Anil Dash already said that Wednesday night. It looks as if all Twitter did was take Dash\u2019s tweet, reword it and send it out to make it look as if the platform has had some deep and profound epiphany. It hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAlso verification is still deliberately being used to conflate \u2018this person is who they say they are\u2019 with \u2018this person has higher status,\u2019\u201d Dash wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is the key. Twitter has used the verification system as described purposely. There\u2019s a reason people\u2014folks with legitimate reasons to be verified\u2014have to go through hell and high water to get that blue check mark. Twitter has wielded verification like a weapon and held it over people\u2019s heads as something they should aspire to or go to great lengths to achieve. This has been purposeful and intentional, and everyone knows it.\n\nSo when Twitter then tries to come back and act as if it is just realizing this is a problem, it is disingenuous at best, and a purposeful deflection from the real issue at worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact remains that, verified or not, Jason Kessler should not have an account at all, considering the Confederate-flag (hate symbol) imagery in his header, but I\u2019ll come back to that.\n\nJack Dorsey added on to the Twitter Support tweet and said, \u201cWe should\u2019ve communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered. And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Jack.\n\nYes, the verification system is \u201cbroken.\u201d And yes, it needs to be fixed, but there is a greater issue here.\n\nYou promised us weeks ago that the platform was going to take a more aggressive stance against hate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just about Jason Kessler being verified. This is about Jason Kessler having an account that is clearly violating the rules that you claimed were going to be enforced more strictly, and about that account going through a verification process that actually puts human eyes at your company on his account\u2014and those human eyes saying, \u201cYes, let\u2019s elevate his platform with this blue checkmark.\u201d\n\nYour company admittedly created this verification pecking order, and your company has done everything to keep it in place.\n\nIt does not go unnoticed that your responses Thursday come after many, many people retweeted my post and my tweet thread and added you to the thread to draw your attention to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou were able to easily ignore the pieces written by other outlets, but you could not ignore mine because it got a lot of traction on social media, and your hand was forced.\n\nSo you come out with this fake-ass \u201cmea culpa,\u201d and we are all supposed to applaud your supposed epiphany, but here\u2019s the thing: You guys say this about everything you get called out on. You said it on Oct. 13 when you got called out on the harassment-and-abuse issue. Your promised big changes.\n\nNothing has changed. It\u2019s business as usual on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou guys pussyfoot around every single issue that is brought to your attention, pretend to be contrite, then ultimately do nothing. This is the Twitter way.\n\nThe other day, I called your attention to someone who was harassing me on Twitter. I blocked the original account from which the person tweeted to me, and the person used a second account to continue the harassment. This is something I brought up in the post I wrote about the harassment problem.\n\nI openly asked for your help, and you ignored that call to duty.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t ignore this one, though.\n\nAnd you won\u2019t be able to ignore any further callouts because this is real.\n\nYou have created a monster, and it is time for you to either tame the beast or slay it altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour move, my guy.\n\nEarlier:\n\nI\u2019ve decided it\u2019s going to be my personal and public crusade to air out Twitter every time it does something that runs counter to what it claims to be about. The platform\u2019s made a big deal recently about how much stricter it\u2019s going to be about enforcing its rules of terms of service, and we\u2019ve all seen Twitter do everything but that. This latest example is no exception.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the \u201cnew\u201d rules Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey outlined in his Oct. 13 tweet thread was a more aggressive stance against \u201chate symbols\u201d and \u201cviolent groups.\u201d How is it, then, that Twitter verified the account of the white nationalist who organized the rally in Charlottesville, Va.\u2014especially when said white nationalist has as his header photo the No. 1 image associated with white racism and hate: the Confederate flag?\n\nJason Kessler tweets under the handle @TheMadDimension. His bio says he is a freelance writer who has written for GotNews, Daily Caller and VDARE. He also identifies himself as the organizer of the Unite the Right rally, aka the Charlottesville riot that ended with the death of Heather Heyer, a counterprotester who was killed when one of Kessler\u2019s many followers plowed a vehicle into a crowd of people who had beliefs that differed from his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKessler bragged on Twitter on Tuesday that his account had \u201cfinally\u201d been verified, which indicates that he applied for the privilege, and someone at Twitter reviewed his account and his credentials and determined that, yes, he should be given the credibility of a blue check mark by his name.\n\n\u201cLooks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter,\u201d Kessler wrote. \u201cI must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center lists Kessler as an \u201cextremist\u201d with a white nationalist ideology; he is included on the SPLC Hatewatch website.\n\nAccording to SPLC, Kessler attempted to unseat Charlottesville\u2019s only black city councilman\u2014Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy\u2014and served as a bridge between a Virginia gubernatorial candidate and the \u201calt-right.\u201d He is described as \u201crelying on the familiar tropes of \u2018white genocide\u2019 and \u2018demographic displacement.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere is an especially interesting tidbit from SPLC\u2019s dossier on Kessler:\n\nRumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler\u2019s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama. At one recent speech in favor of Charlottesville\u2019s status as a sanctuary city, Kessler live-streamed himself as an attendee questioned him and apologized for an undisclosed spat during Kessler\u2019s apparent involvement with Occupy. Kessler appeared visibly perturbed by the woman\u2019s presence and reminders of their past association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKessler claims that he was radicalized after public relations exec Justine Sacco was fired for making an extremely tasteless and racist joke about AIDS in Africa in late 2013. (Sidenote: Remember the #HasJustineLandedYet hashtag? Good. Fucking. Times. That was really the golden age of Twitter, I swear.)\n\nKessler said of the Sacco incident, \u201c ... so it was a little racist joke, nothing that big of a deal, she didn\u2019t have that many followers, she probably didn\u2019t think anybody was going to see it.\u201d\n\nIn December 2016, Kessler wrote a post titled, \u201cThe End of Identity Politics: To Ensure Peace, Prepare for War,\u201d in which he said:\n\nBut make no mistake, the age of innocence is over for whites politically. We are becoming a displaced minority in our own country thanks to Democrat policies. They tax the hell out of middle class families who might want to have more children while paying for welfare queens to have 5 or 6 babies they can\u2019t support. They provide sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants who flood in from south of the border and import Islamists from the most dangerous countries on Earth. The time for supplication is over. We need to fight back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter just validated everything this man has to say by giving him that blue check mark after his name.\n\nBut Twitter is taking a more aggressive stance against hate and violence, right?\n\nRight.\n\nTwitter is directly enabling white supremacy and white nationalist ideology.\n\nTwitter is full of shit.", "keywords": ["verify", "account", "accidentally", "broken", "support", "white", "oops", "verification", "person", "fix", "kessler", "itsoon", "verified", "nationalist", "system", "twitter", "going"], "polarity": 0.04275498891352549, "subjectivity": 0.41693203815155033},

Stephen Upman, a Charlottesville police spokesman, said that the disorderly conduct charge is related to the makeshift flamethrower Long was seen using in the photo, and the assault and battery charge is related to a separate skirmish during the rally.\n\nLong is the second black counterprotester to be arrested in connection with the Charlottesville melee. The Los Angeles Times reports that Charlottesville police investigators arrested Long, 23, of Culpeper, Va., on Friday. A second man, DeAndre Harris, who had his head beaten in by white supremacists, was arrested a day before on charges of \u201cunlawful wounding,\u201d as previously reported by The Root.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Root shortly after the rally, Long said that he acted in self-defense and was protecting an old man sitting next to him, who was being attacked by scores of white supremacists. As The Root reported:\n\n\u201cAt first it was peaceful protest,\u201d Long said softly as he spoke. \u201cUntil someone pointed a gun at my head. Then the same person pointed it at my foot and shot the ground.\u201d Long said the only weapon he had was a can of spray paint that a white supremacist had thrown at him earlier, so he took a lighter to the spray paint and turned it into a flamethrower. And a photographer snapped the photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police, he said, did nothing.\n\nThere is also another photograph of that moment that clearly shows a white supremacist marcher holding a gun and pointing it in Long\u2019s direction. That man, Richard Wilson Preston, 52, was arrested in August and charged with discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school, according to the Times, but only after a video provided by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia was given to the FBI. Preston faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong was released on an unsecured bond Friday and referred all questions to his attorney, Malik Zulu Shabazz, national president of the Black Lawyers for Justice and former national chairman of the New Black Panther Party.\n\nThe Times reports that in August, two of Harris\u2019 alleged attackers\u2014Alex Michael Ramos, 33, and Daniel Borden, 18\u2014were arrested after they were identified by activists through video and social media, and earlier this week, a third man, Jacob Goodwin, 22, was also arrested in Harris\u2019 attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, for those keeping score, two black counterprotesters\u2014who clearly, in the eyes of most sane people, were acting in self-defense\u2014have been arrested in Virginia, and four white supremacists have been, too.\n\nThe fifth white supremacist arrested, of course, was James Alex Fields Jr., who is charged with driving a car through a crowd of counterprotesters and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others.\n\nGuess Virginia police are taking the Trumpian stance of blaming \u201cboth sides.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Los Angeles Times.", "keywords": ["man", "arrested", "supremacists", "times", "white", "black", "flamethrower", "corey", "charlottesville", "protect", "long", "wielding", "va", "supremacist", "virginia"], "polarity": 0.023915626856803325, "subjectivity": 0.3005793226381462},

However, the material in the dossier was said to have been shown to both Trump and Obama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors write that Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, had encouraged James Clapper, director of national intelligence, during the daily intelligence briefing to tell Obama about the \u201cgolden showers\u201d allegation.\n\n\u201cObama turned to Rice and said, \u2018Why am I hearing this?\u2019 He was incredulous,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write. \u201c \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 he asked. Rice said the intelligence community had no idea if this story was true but that Obama needed to be aware the allegation was circulating. \u2018You don\u2019t really expect to hear the term \u201cgolden showers\u201d in the President [cq] Daily Brief,\u2019 a participant in this meeting later said, \u2018or that the guy who is going to become president may be a Manchurian candidate.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe reporters also write, \u201cWhen [Vice President Joseph P.] Biden was briefed about intelligence reports on the connections between various players in the Trump orbit and the Kremlin, he had a visceral reaction. \u2018If this is true,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018it\u2019s treason.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d has a larger focus than Obama and race, as Steven Lee Myers wrote in a review published Wednesday by the New York Times. Myers notes that its \u201csubtitle promises to reveal \u2018the inside story of Putin\u2019s war on America and the election of Donald Trump,\u2019 but adds, \u201cAlas, it does not \u2014 at least so far as offering foolproof evidence of Putin\u2019s involvement, or his motives.\u201d\n\nStill, an excerpt published in Mother Jones touches on Trump\u2019s posture toward women of color. The setting is a 2013 visit to Moscow to support the Miss Universe pageant, which he owned.\n\n\u201cFrequently, Trump would toss out finalists and replace them with others he preferred. \u2018If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,\u2019 a Miss Universe staffer later noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnother Miss Universe staffer recalled, \u2018He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.\u201d On occasion, according to this staffer, Trump would reject a woman \u2018who had snubbed his advances.\u2019\n\n\u201cOnce in a while,\u201d Paula Shugart, the president of the Miss Universe Organization, \u201c would politely challenge Trump\u2019s choices. Sometimes she would win the argument, sometimes not. \u2018If he didn\u2019t like a woman because she looked too ethnic, you could sometimes persuade him by telling him she was a princess and married to a football player,\u2019 a staffer later explained. . . .\u201d\n\nPhilip Bump, Washington Post: 4.4 million 2012 Obama voters stayed home in 2016 \u2014 more than a third of them black\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Corn and Michael Isikoff, Mother Jones: \u201cWhy the Hell Are We Standing Down?\u201d (book excerpt)\n\n\n\nDavid Corn and Michael Isikoff, Mother Jones: What Happened in Moscow: The Inside Story of How Trump\u2019s Obsession With Putin Began (book excerpt)\n\n\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: Steve Scalise\u2019s bizarre claim that Donald Trump\u2019s been tough on Russia\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Jacoby, Boston Globe: Deval Patrick for president?

Then came a loud pop as a bullet went right through Courtlin\u2019s heart, ending her life way too short of adulthood.\n\n\u2018 \u2018The last thing I told them was \u201cI love you\u201d and have a blessed day at school,\u2019 Courtlin\u2019s mom, Tynesha Tatum, who has another son and daughter in the same high school, told the Birmingham News. \u2018That was at 7:45 a.m\u2026At 3:45 p.m., I got a call that my baby got shot.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, Courtlin\u2019s schoolmates \u2014 her murder still ringing in their ears \u2014 are planning to walk out of school and protest the lack of safety for teenagers trying to grow up in the most gun-crazed nation on the planet.

No, Courtlin Arrington was killed by a handgun inside Huffman High School in Birmingham, Ala., in the kind of struggling urban district where kids have grown all too accustomed to hardship, even to violence.\n\n\u201cEven so, it was somewhat shocking that a shooting inside a school classroom received virtually no national coverage . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOf course, one death may seem less impactful than one of the 10 largest mass shootings in U.S. history, but tell that to Courtlin\u2019s classmates who will be traumatized by the sound of that fatal gunshot for the rest of their lives. There\u2019s no definitive way to know how much of the ignoring of her story was simply fatigue, in a nation where gun deaths remain off the charts, and how much is because both Courtlin and her alleged killer are African-Americans. . . .\u201d\n\nJenice Armstrong, Philadelphia Daily News: We must all support Wednesday\u2019s student walkout to toughen gun laws\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: New Orleans students to demand gun control in National School Walkout\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Baltimore Sun: Student walkout: Protest has a price\n\n\n\nEditorial, Buffalo News: In support of the student walkout\n\n\n\nEditorial, Chicago Sun-Times: In Chicago, 79 dead of guns so far this year.

Robert W. Lee IV, a direct descendant of the Civil War general whose name has become synonymous with the Confederacy, appeared on television and spoke out against racism and the riots in Charlottesville, Va., that happened during protests about the removal of a statue of his famous ancestor. Now Lee says that appearance has caused him to be forced out of his own church.\n\nAs previously reported on The Root, Lee appeared on the Aug. 27 telecast of the MTV Video Music Awards and spoke out against racism and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHe told The Telegraph that his appearance on the awards show and his denunciation of statues dedicated to his ancestor have led to him being forced out of Bethany United Church of Christ in Winston-Salem, N.C., where he has been ministering since April.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lee said that he does not regret speaking out against white supremacists even though it has cost him his job.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you speak out against injustice, the cost can be great,\u201d he told The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the awards show, Lee had called for statues of his Confederate ancestor to be removed.\n\n\u201cWe have made my ancestor an idol of white supremacy, racism and hate,\u201d Lee said in his speech. \u201cAs a pastor, it is my moral duty to speak out against racism, America\u2019s original sin. Today I call on all of us with privilege and power to answer God\u2019s call, to confront racism and white supremacy head-on.\n\n\u201cWe can find inspiration in the Black Lives Matter movement, the women who marched in the Women\u2019s March in January and, especially, Heather Heyer, who died fighting for her beliefs,\u201d he continued before introducing Heyer\u2019s mother, Susan Bro, to the audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeyer was killed during the Charlottesville riot when a white supremacist rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, Lee\u2019s speech put the spotlight on him and his tiny congregation. It was a spotlight that some members did not want.\n\n\u201cThere was a small faction of the church that came to me and said they were not comfortable with me speaking about these issues, and the media attention,\u201d Lee told The Telegraph. \u201cSo I felt it was incumbent on me to resign.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResigning has not changed his stance on the issues, however.\n\n\u201cWe have to speak up against these issues, and say them as they are,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBlack lives do matter.

I think it\u2019s a dangerous narrative being told in that part of the U.S. who say that Black Lives Matter are terrorists, and I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n\nLee said that on Tuesday he received a call of support from the Rev. John Dorhauer, who is the national president of the United Church of Christ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while the church has not made a comment on his resignation, at least one member of the congregation has spoken on the issue. Brenda Jones, the church organist and choir director, told a local newspaper that she was shocked to learn of Lee\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cIt just breaks my heart,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat is all I have to say about it.\u201d", "keywords": ["racism", "church", "white", "supporting", "matter", "told", "quits", "telegraph", "lives", "spoke", "lee", "descendant", "robert", "criticized", "black", "ancestor"], "polarity": -0.06861111111111112, "subjectivity": 0.44166666666666676},

One weapon Putin described as a \u201clow-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile ... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defense and air defense,\u201d the BBC reports.\n\nIn true Putin fashion, he didn\u2019t actually show the weapons, which all sound like the nuclear equivalent of a shark carrying an alligator on its back. According to Putin, who lies about as much as the current U.S. president, Russia has crafted undetectable weapons that can do all kinds of amazing destruction, and America better pay attention!\n\nHere\u2019s how Business Insider described the Russian unveiling of mass destruction:\n\nA computer-generated animation accompanied each weapon announcement, perhaps illustrating that they exist mainly in a conceptual state. First, Putin mentioned a new intercontinental ballistic, which he claimed had unlimited range and could get past all US missile defenses. An animation showed the missile taking two trajectories toward the West. Without showing much real video of the product, Putin said \u201cour defense companies have launched mass production of this new system.\u201d Next, Putin announced what he called a \u201cglobal cruise missile,\u201d which he claimed had unlimited range and was nuclear-propelled. An animation showed the missile fired from Russia\u2019s north, flying north of Europe into the Atlantic, weaving through US air-defense zones, and then inexplicably traveling south the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean before wrapping around Argentina and ending up near Chile. Then, Putin seemed to confirm a long-feared \u201cdoomsday\u201d weapon: an unmanned, undersea vehicle capable of carrying a nuclear weapon across oceans at high speeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it may have only been computer-generated destruction of the West, it proves that Russia is not our friend, so it may be time for President Donald Trump to stop emailing Putin about which workout classes he\u2019s taking and how he makes his three-bean chili dip, and start treating Russia like the threat it has always been.\n\n\u201cThey kept ignoring us,\u201d Putin said of the West, to a standing ovation, Business Insider reports. \u201cNobody wanted to listen to us, so listen to us now.\u201d", "keywords": ["president", "claimed", "putin", "nuclear", "defense", "trump", "missile", "vladimir", "west", "come", "claims", "cant", "weapon", "intercepted", "weapons", "russia"], "polarity": 0.1048030303030303, "subjectivity": 0.40401010101010104},

But the news cycle that seems to find Russia under every rock has become too repetitive and overwhelming for me to bear any longer.\n\nWithout question, it\u2019s clear that Moscow tried to exploit Americans\u2019 political views through social media during the 2016 presidential election. Not only have America\u2019s intelligence communities determined as much, but the heads of the social media platforms that Russian-backed entities exploited concur. Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2014be it his former national security adviser Mike Flynn or ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2014have ties to Moscow that point to possible collusion.\n\nJulia Ioffe of The Atlantic recently reported that Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks via private messages on Twitter concerning damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Hope Hicks may have tried to hide emails concerning a mysterious meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians tied to the Kremlin. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News that the Russian government breached U.S. voting systems.\n\nThese stories are revealing but are few and far between. When we aren\u2019t hearing groundbreaking news on the Russian investigation, which is not common, we\u2019re inundated with talking heads discussing how shady Trump and his cronies are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYawn. We know already.\n\nMy problem with the news cycle is that it is ignoring white America\u2019s complicity in the Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the first place. If Russian bots can undo in one election cycle what it took centuries to build, does America have a democracy at all? And if we are to believe that disinformation campaigns turned the outcome for Trump (there is no evidence of that), why didn\u2019t most voters of color cast ballots for him?\n\nA lack of a self-reflective discourse in mainstream media\u2019s coverage essentially scapegoats Russia for the debacle that is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. It\u2019s one thing to cover the Russia investigation. It\u2019s another to ignore or downplay why white people voted for a man who refused to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, even when America\u2019s top intelligence agencies confirmed Putin\u2019s role in attempting to undermine the U.S. political process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia coverage devoid of this angle ignores the social chasms that compel white people to choose their race over allegiance to their country. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s challenging for me to watch and read news of Russia\u2019s threat to democracy when America is doing a great job of destroying it all by itself.\n\n\n\nMy cynicism is rooted in the knowledge of America\u2019s barbaric resolve to strip black people of their rights to fully experience the democracy that, coincidentally, did not come under attack until Russia unleashed a legion of Twitter trolls.\n\n\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t afford me the luxury of binary analysis. I can\u2019t just look at the Kremlin\u2019s threats against America without recognizing the internal threats that Moscow actively attempted to exploit\u2014threats that have a personal impact on my life as a black person. I don\u2019t enjoy the full spectrum of citizenship; nor does the rest of black America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve endured more than 200 years of slavery, decades of Jim Crow, mob violence and voter suppression. These horrendous periods still haunt America. The Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voter Rights Act in 2013. GOP-led state legislatures actively passed voter-ID laws that make voting harder. America\u2019s police state kills black people at disproportionate rates, and governments at the federal and state levels are actively undermining health care access.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t flow with the \u201cRussia is attacking our democracy\u201d angle because America is doing a better job of it. Of course, we can admit that Russian meddling isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019d be more inclined to engage media that explores Americans\u2019 complicity in it. I know what\u2019s wrong with this country, and it isn\u2019t Russia. It\u2019s racist white Trump supporters. If they had followed the conscience of people of color (especially black women), American democracy wouldn\u2019t be under the threat it\u2019s currently in.\n\nTo see countless white men (former ambassadors, think tank types, legislators and the running chorus of talking heads) appear on network television extolling the virtues of America\u2019s so-called democracy that Russia wants to undermine annoys me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs journalists, it is our job to report the facts. That racism both fueled Trump\u2019s victory and has consequently made us more susceptible to foreign attack only makes the stakes of the Russia investigation even higher. But major networks and print outlets will not lead with stories exploring white America\u2019s obsession with racism. That would upset too many advertisers\u2014and white viewers. But it would be the beginning of the type of intersectional Russia coverage that could help an audience better understand Russia and America\u2019s imperial aims and how election meddling plays a role in it.\n\nAs soon as Trump is arrested or forced to resign, I fear interest in Russia will fade, and that would be a pity. There has rarely been a better time than now to learn about the complexities of Russian imperialism and the lessons it can teach us about America\u2019s shortcomings at home and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth nations actively vie for world supremacy through a range of tactics, including political interference in some cases and through military force in others. Our media can play a vital role of explaining U.S.-Russia relations within this context. Such deep dives require media outlets and the white men who run them to understand how white supremacy and empire work.\n\n\n\nAnother problem with our media\u2019s fixation on Russia-gate is that other important news stories are getting little to no attention. Trump is belligerently calling for a nuclear arms race. As late as the mid-1980s, there were some 75,000 nuclear weapons in the world, mostly between Russia and the United States. Calm-headed diplomacy between Moscow and Washington, D.C., over the decades cut that figure down to around 15,000.\n\nThe new Nuclear Posture Review clearly shows that America isn\u2019t interested in cutting anymore nukes; nor is Trump interested in using his alleged good relationship with Putin to convince the Russian leader to reverse his own lust for nukes. All eyes are on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but Trump\u2019s love for nuclear weapons may very well convince Russia that there is no need to scale back its arsenal, making the world a less safe place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while politics between Russia and America on Earth are frayed, their relationship in space is strong. Roscosmos, Russia\u2019s space agency, and NASA announced the Deep Space Getaway program last year, part of a larger project to send humans to the moon. It is one of the few areas in which both nations must get along. Exploring why Moscow and Washington are cooperating in space would reveal that the two nations aren\u2019t always at odds and that they do need each other.\n\nAnd as much as the media love to cover Putin as an authoritarian the Russian people foolishly support, it is important to consider that most of white America supported Trump, who seemingly envies his Russian counterpart\u2019s anti-democratic ways. Indeed, Putin and Trump supporters may have a lot in common.\n\nSimply viewing Russia as an attacker of American values without investigating how Americans are destroying them in far worse ways isn\u2019t good Russia reporting. It simply blames Russia for Trump. That is insulting to the Russian people and Americans who know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil mainstream newsrooms make proper paradigm shifts in how they report the complexities of why Russia is doing what it is doing and why Americans are susceptible to it, we\u2019ll continue to suffer through one-sided reporting that indirectly weakens the democracy that American media strive to defend.\n\n", "keywords": ["moscow", "russian", "media", "democracy", "boring", "white", "nuclear", "america", "trump", "americas", "russia"], "polarity": 0.06519909237300542, "subjectivity": 0.3877371018675368},

This All Lives Matter revolution in response to his presidency\u2014and the hoodless Klanspeople and White Citizens\u2019 Councillors it has emboldened\u2014is born of the realization that more white people will die. More white people will be collateral damage in a war on poor and working-class black and brown people that has decimated communities and families for generations.

This America has been nurtured, massaged and shaped brick by brick by a whiteness that is rotten to its core. To paraphrase James Baldwin from his 1970 letter to Angela Davis, black people in this country have long warned so-called good white folks that if they stood down while the badge-wearing lynchers, the U.S.-military-uniform-wearing fascists, the black-robe-wearing white supremacists and the domestic terrorists next door came for us in the morning, then they would surely come for them at night.\n\n\n\nThis I know to be true: There would be no widespread calls to \u201cresist,\u201d no insistence that this is \u201cour revolution,\u201d no catchy chants of \u201cHey, hey, ho-ho, white supremacy has got to go\u201d if that had not come to pass.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen so-called good white people slow-dance with devils\u2014when the vile rhythm of racism, its crescendo and crash, is the embedded soundtrack of this wretched nation\u2014they should not be surprised when they wake up in hell.\n\nThe state-sanctioned executions of little black boys and girls have been marginalized, considered too \u201cpoliticized\u201d a cause to pledge allegiance to openly and without reservation, but this political fight that has led to the spilling of white blood is supposed to be an American one by default.\n\n\n\nNo. I will not pretend that this is a new America for some false sense of unity.

They are indicative of the sentiment of white people throughout this country who thought a subhuman species good for nothing but work and servitude might ruin America with their crime, poverty and interbreeding with white women. They were not referring to Africans, Mexicans or Muslims.\n\nThey were talking about the Irish.\n\nFirst, we should get this out of the way: One of the favorite recurring themes of racists in America is the idea that the Irish came to America as slaves and had it as bad as, or worse than, Africans. According to these \u201cracialists,\u201d the European blood in the Irish made them pull themselves up by their bootstraps and integrate themselves into the opening arms of American liberty. They never bitched and moaned about their situation, so ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is wrong. In fact, it is too stupid to give space, credence or words, so read where it is debunked here and here.\n\nBut as we celebrate the first St. Patrick\u2019s Day of the Trumpian era, we should remember when America passed laws against another group of immigrants. We should recall when this country tried to ban another group of people based on their religion. We should never forget that both \u201cAmerican\u201d and whiteness are sociopolitical constructs that have evolved over a long period of time, always seeking exclusion and supremacy, and it was not so long ago that Irish Americans were on the outside looking in.\n\nIn his book The Renegade History of the United States, Thaddeus Russell explains that the first large wave of Irish immigrants worked low-paying jobs\u2014mostly building the canals along the Canadian border\u2014that other Americans wouldn\u2019t do. Like finding out a song you thought was new is actually a 100-year-old remake, the Irish were simultaneously accused of stealing all the good jobs and branded as \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cshiftless.\u201d They were also thought to be the nonwhite \u201cmissing link\u201d between the superior European and the savage African based on stereotypes from the early American media, according to the Boston Globe:\n\nIn the popular press, the Irish were depicted as subhuman. They were carriers of disease. They were drawn as lazy, clannish, unclean, drunken brawlers who wallowed in crime and bred like rats. Most disturbingly, the Irish were Roman Catholics coming to an overwhelmingly Protestant nation and their devotion to the pope made their allegiance to the United States suspect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1798, Congress passed three \u201cAlien Acts\u201d based mainly on fears of Irish-Catholic, anti-immigrant sentiment. These new laws gave the president the power to stop immigration from any country at war with the U.S. and the right to deport any immigrant, and made it harder for immigrants to vote. Then, again in the late 1840s, a nationalist political group called the Know-Nothings sprang from a populist movement of poor whites who were dissatisfied with the two-party system and started the American Party, intent on preserving America\u2019s culture by restricting immigration, especially from Catholic countries\u2014including by Irish Catholics. They managed to get candidates elected into the highest political offices in America, including a president.\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nSo how did the Irish become white?\n\nRussell suggests they did it by coalescing their political power while simultaneously assimilating into the American mainstream, specifically with jobs in civil service (which is why most cities\u2019 St. Patrick Day parades are ostensibly celebrations of police and fire departments):\n\nIn 1840, at the beginning of the great wave of Irish immigration, there was only a handful of Irish police officers on the force. ... By the end of the year, Irish made up more than one-quarter of the New York City police, and by the end of the century, more than half the city\u2019s police and more than 75 percent of its firefighters were Irish Americans. In addition, Irish were disproportionately represented among prosecutors, judges and prison guards. Soon, the Irish cop was a stock figure in American culture. Once known as apelike barbarians, the Irish were now able to show themselves as the most selfless and patriotic civil servants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his book How the Irish Became White, author Noel Ignatiev notes, \u201cWhile the white skin made the Irish eligible for membership in the white race, it did not guarantee their admission; they had to earn it.\u201d Ignatiev and other scholars argue that the sons of Ireland gained their white status by joining the fight against abolition and uniting in the suppression of blacks\u2014embracing the oldest American tradition of them all: racism.\n\n\u201cWhile Irish American repealers maintained a pride and love for their homeland, they acted unabashedly American in the way they dealt with the slavery controversy.\u201d\u2014Angela F. Murphy in American Slavery, Irish Freedom: Abolition, Immigrant Citizenship, and the Transatlantic Movement for Irish Repeal\n\nBut there is a simpler, less complex explanation for how this country eventually came to view the Irish as regular, good, American white people:\n\nThey just did it.\n\n\u201cWhiteness\u201d isn\u2019t real. Ultimately, race is a social construct, and \u201cwhite\u201d is just some dumb shit that people made up a long time ago to build a fence around their idea of self-supremacy. The Irish didn\u2019t suddenly calm down, put down the Guinness, put their noses to the grindstone and work their way into an exclusive club. They had the same historical trajectory in America as the Polish, Italians and Jewish people. Their melanin-less skin just afforded them an opportunity to blend in that black people will never get.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cgreat white race\u201d is as real as a mermaid riding a unicorn on the back of a dragon while listening to dope lyrics from Lil Uzi, and that\u2019s why white supremacy is so stupid. People who perpetuate that bullshit should be paid the same attention as alt-right advocates, Hoteps, flat-earthers and anyone who owns an Iggy Azalea album.\n\nSo later tonight, as you\u2019re kneeling by the toilet blowing chunks of corned beef and green beer, if you start thinking about how poorly we treat immigrants and how we live in a new era of intolerance and hate, just remember how the Irish became white. Because just like St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations, whiteness and racism itself\u2014it\u2019s an American tradition that has existed for a long time.", "keywords": ["irish", "american", "white", "america", "way", "country", "thought", "long", "immigrants", "werent", "race"], "polarity": 0.020402938111271442, "subjectivity": 0.3099209625251292},

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["republican", "gop", "president", "weak", "russian", "obama", "hawks", "trumps", "russias", "ukraine", "fake", "trump", "look", "russia", "making"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

While he has complimented many strongmen around the world, three stand out the most.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Supports police brutality, uses crude language, has no filter.\n\nAnalysis: Like Trump, Duterte encourages police brutality, but the Philippines leader takes it to an extreme. Trump has gone on record telling police officers to rough up people taken into custody and has considered sending the feds to Chicago, which essentially would make them an occupying force that does nothing to reduce crime. Back in the mid-1980s, he ran ads in major New York City papers calling for five black men to be executed after they were wrongly arrested for raping a white woman in Central Park. Of course, racism was a driving force behind all of this, but it also fuels his desire to use over-the-top government policing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother quality Trump shares with Duterte is his lack of a filter. Duterte once compared himself to Hitler. He later apologized. In October of last year, Duterte told then-President Barack Obama to \u201cgo to hell,\u201d just as the United States and the Philippines began joint military exercises. The following month, Duterte called Obama a \u201cson of a whore.\u201d Of course, since Russia and China are closer geographically, it would make sense for the Philippines to forge strong ties with them, but the United States and the Philippines share a defense treaty that states they would protect each other if attacked by an external force.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a smart idea to piss off the world\u2019s most powerful military that could protect you when the time calls for it. But Duterte isn\u2019t one to think through things. Neither is his buddy Trump.\n\nBut Trump apparently likes Duterte\u2019s ability to do and say as he pleases. Duterte is not a dictator per se, and he enjoys widespread support, despite his abuse of police power. Trump probably wishes he could abuse his powers and have widespread support, too, but U.S. rule of law would not allow it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess Trump has to admire those who can.\n\nVladimir Putin, President of Russia\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Authoritarian, leads a kleptocracy, answers to no one.\n\nAnalysis: The obvious reason for this is probably the fact that the U.S. intelligence community believes that the Kremlin worked to get Trump elected. Not to mention Russia\u2019s alleged ties to WikiLeaks, which, according to a recent report in The Atlantic, was in contact with Donald Trump Jr. But there are personality reasons why Trump would find Vladimir Putin to be an aspirational leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor one, Russia is a kleptocracy. That\u2019s a fancy political science term that means those in power use the state primarily to steal resources from the state. Or, more directly, rule by thieves. Putin\u2019s estimated net worth is in the billions of dollars. PBS\u2019s Frontline aired a documentary in which Putin is accused of using his political position in the early 1990s to steal land from the Russian state and sell it for personal gain.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House very much functions as a kleptocracy. He has openly acknowledged that his resorts and golf courses have generated tens of millions of dollars since he took office in January. His properties Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, and Bedminster, in New Jersey, have gotten free advertising during his estimated 58 visits so far as president. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser who takes on major foreign policy roles, even though he has no foreign policy experience. In her role as White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway once promoted Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing on live television in what some considered a violation of federal ethics rules. Ivanka also received lucrative Chinese patents the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. The list goes on and on.\n\nAnother reason Trump may find Putin appealing is his suppression of freedom of expression. Artists, film directors and journalists have all felt the strain (and, in some cases, been killed) under Putin\u2019s restrictive regime. Trump cannot control media here and has long referred to the press as \u201cfake news\u201d because of its fair reporting of his administration. In October he even threatened to challenge media organizations\u2019 licenses. He really can\u2019t do that, but Trump\u2019s desire to do so is the stuff of authoritarian states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump wants to be a strongman, but because the United States is a functioning democracy, he can\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from adoring men like Putin who can be.\n\nKim Jong Un, Leader of North Korea\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Unpredictable, runs a totalitarian state.\n\nAnalysis: Given that Kim Jong Un has consistently vowed to wipe the United States off the map, it really doesn\u2019t make sense for Trump to find the North Korean leader likable. But this is Trump, and nothing makes sense in his world. Back in May, he complimented Kim for, apparently, taking out his adversaries to assume power of Pyongyang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of people, I\u2019m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he was able to do it. So obviously, he\u2019s a pretty smart cookie.\u201d\n\nDuring a campaign rally last early year, Trump made similar remarks, according to ABC News:\n\n\u201cHow many young guys\u2014he was like 26 or 25 when his father died\u2014take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden ... he goes in, he takes over, and he\u2019s the boss,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn\u2019t play games. And we can\u2019t play games with him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Trump has called Kim \u201cRocket Man\u201d and the North Korean leader has returned the insults. But Trump\u2019s complimentary remarks toward Kim do reflect the president\u2019s perverted understanding of strength. North Korea is a totalitarian state, meaning that the people are completely submissive to the rule of the dictator and the state. This is actually worse than either Putin\u2019s Russia or Duterte\u2019s Philippines because at least people in those nations can protest, albeit with limitations, in the case of Russia.\n\nBut perhaps Kim\u2019s appeal to Trump has to do with the North Korean people\u2019s worship of their leader. Official events in the country often show people expressing such adulation for Kim and its past leaders that they are left in tears. While many analysts argue that these celebrations are forced, one could say that Trump\u2019s own healthy ego yearns for such attention\u2014even if it is not sincere.\n\nHere in the United States, Trump gets nothing like the public support that Kim, Putin and Duterte receive in their own nations. None of those nations, though, are model democracies, and all lack certain degrees of the rule of law. What is troubling is Trump\u2019s desire to erode the rule of law in his own country. Whether it\u2019s his frustration over not being able to unleash the Justice Department on Hillary Clinton or how the media operates, Trump has no real appreciation for democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes sense, though. He doesn\u2019t truly believe in it anyway. And neither do his buddies in Russia, North Korea and the Philippines.\n\n", "keywords": ["president", "putin", "trumps", "guide", "strongmen", "kim", "trump", "rule", "love", "states", "duterte", "north", "donald", "philippines"], "polarity": 0.08955911372578039, "subjectivity": 0.4314021472354806},

It\u2019s pretty basic: If you\u2019re willing to throw your people under the bus in order to promote your selfish ambitions and cuddle up with the (white) man, you\u2019re a sellout.\n\nWhile I have strived to divorce myself from using such language for the sake of productive dialogue, I cannot help exploring the cases of Donald Trump and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, both of whom sold out their respective countries for closer proximity to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe main link between these two sellouts: Paul Manafort.\n\nIt makes sense that Manafort, who spent 10 years in Ukraine advising Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions, would eventually take the helm of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. To be sure, Yanukovych is very much like Trump. His only interests in Ukraine were to get rich and maintain power, according to John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2004 to 2006. Likewise, Trump cares little about policy and more about ratcheting up racial anxiety among his base to maintain his hold on the Oval Office\u2014not to mention he\u2019s also using it as a cash cow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYanukovych, who was convicted of robbery and assault as a younger man, was widely considered a corrupt politician as an adult, and his Party of Regions has long been believed to have Mafia ties. Manafort cleaned up Yanukovych\u2019s image, teaching him how to deliver a speech even though the American spoke no Russian or Ukrainian. Manafort instructed him on how to expand his base beyond the Russian-speaking minorities who backed him in the eastern part of the country. In 2004, Yanukovych ran for president and won, but the election was rife with voter fraud, leading to mass protests and, eventually, a do-over that was won by his pro-Western opponent, Viktor Yushchenko.\n\nThough Yanukovych lost, Manafort earned a role as a top adviser to the Party of Regions and would plot for the next election in 2010, which Yanukovych would eventually win in a very close race. One of the first controversial moves Yanukovych made was to extend the lease of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, set to expire in 2017, to at least 2042. For many Ukrainians who feared Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions for Ukraine, Yanukovych\u2019s move was a clear sign that Kiev would be under Moscow\u2019s thumb for decades to come.\n\nDuring his time in office, Yanukovych would eventually run the country into the ground and steal billions of dollars from its coffers, according to Ukrainian officials. Manafort was allegedly paid more than $28 million for his work over the period he was in Ukraine. For his part, Manafort insists that he wanted to coach the Party of Regions and Yanukovych to become more Westernized and less corrupt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final straw for Ukrainians tired of Yanukovych came in 2013, when he reneged on signing the European Union Association Agreement that many Ukrainians supported at the time and felt would pull the country closer to better economic opportunities in the West. Putin was against the deal and threatened Yanukovych politically if he went through with it.\n\nYanukovych caved, and again, in less than 10 years, people stormed the streets, this time calling for Yanukovych\u2019s resignation. He responded by allegedly ordering the nation\u2019s security services to fire into crowds of protesters, killing dozens of them. Snipers were even used to terrorize protesters, Ukrainian officials allege. And, to add insult to injury, Yanukovych called on Russia to use force to put down his own people\u2019s protests because he lacked the leadership to look them in the eye after falling out of their favor.\n\nIf calling on another nation\u2019s military to suppress protests in your own country isn\u2019t a sellout move, I really do not know what is. Yanukovych eventually fled and is in hiding in Russia under the care of Putin, who would eventually annex Crimea, a region in east Ukraine, and back rebels in eastern Ukraine who are waging war against Kiev. Yep, Yanukovych is chillin\u2019 in Russia with folks who do not really want Ukraine to be its own nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, folks, was the man Manafort backed for 10 years. A pure sellout to his people and his country.\n\nSo when Manafort left Ukraine in 2014, it would make sense for him to eventually see an opportunity in backing Trump, a man who is as much a sellout as Yanukovych. We didn\u2019t know in the beginning of Trump\u2019s campaign, but his top aides were allegedly forming very suspect alliances with Russians who reportedly have ties to the Kremlin. Carter Page, Mike Flynn, Manafort himself and others would eventually have to leave the Trump campaign because of those suspicious ties.\n\nTrump, curiously, has yet to say anything negative about Putin despite criticizing former President Barack Obama for allowing Russia to invade Ukraine. Trump said nothing as it became clear that Putin was meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which U.S. intelligence officials believe was done to support Trump. To this day, he has yet to condemn Russia for its actions. To the contrary, he has created a voter-fraud commission that will likely lead to voter suppression of black and brown Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you remember, Trump encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, a pure sellout thing to do. Manafort would not stay on to lead Trump to his November victory, but Manafort\u2019s efforts to put a Kremlin puppet in the White House reveal how willing he is to help world leaders sell out their countries for access to Russia.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Robert Mueller is in the thick of his investigation, so we are still learning the details of Manafort\u2019s ties to Russia and any possible ties to the Trump campaign. But one thing is very clear: Manafort is tied to two world leaders who sold out their countries at the expense of risking their sovereignty to an expansionist Kremlin.\n\nThe thing about sellouts is that they are ostracized and shunned by their people. Or at least they should be. Ukrainians did the right thing and revolted against Yanukovych, sending him to Russia, where he belongs. Americans should get Trump and his ilk one-way tickets to Moscow as well. But unlike Ukrainians, many white folks here actually support Trump being a sellout to Putin. So that leaves us to depend on Mueller, who is expected to force Trump\u2019s inner circle to account for what appears to be collusion with Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManafort was charged with 12 counts on Monday, including conspiracy against the United States, but there was one missing: being the adviser of sellouts.", "keywords": ["ukrainian", "putin", "ukrainians", "ukraine", "sellout", "trump", "sellouts", "paul", "yanukovych", "eventually", "adviser", "russia", "manafort"], "polarity": 0.04486935972891029, "subjectivity": 0.4223961120028535},

Police sources are now confirming that Hernandez\u2019s closeted sexuality is being investigated as a possible motive in the murder of his friend Odin Lloyd.\n\nNewsweek reports that an intimate relationship Hernandez had with a male former high school classmate was at the center of the investigation into Lloyd\u2019s murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErnest Wallace, who was a co-defendant in the Lloyd murder case, reportedly told detectives that Lloyd had called Hernandez a \u201cschmoocher,\u201d which Hernandez and his companions took as a gay slur, and according to Newsweek, Wallace was also recorded during a jailhouse visit telling Hernandez\u2019s cousin Tanya Singleton that he would not have helped Hernandez get rid of the murder weapon if he had known that Hernandez was a \u201climp wrist.\u201d\n\nFrom Newsweek:\n\nHernandez\u2019s alleged longtime male lover, the high school friend, was interviewed extensively by authorities after Lloyd\u2019s murder, and was forced to testify in front of a grand jury. Law enforcement officials also say Hernandez moved a large amount of money into three accounts shortly before his arrest for the Lloyd killing: one account was for his fianc\u00e9e; a second was for his daughter; the third, where the most money was moved, was for that friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Hernandez carried on this thug image in order to hide his sexuality, then this story is even more tragic than initially thought because it means that America, and all the toxic masculinity and male fragility that it perpetuates, is at least partially complicit in these crimes.\n\nWe live in a society where men are not allowed to be viewed as less than manly for fear of being ostracized, or, worse yet, are persecuted for who they are and who they love.\n\nIf Hernandez was indeed trapped in the closet, the ending of his story is even sadder than we imagined.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nThe rumor mill surrounding former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez\u2019s suicide continues to whirl, and the stories are getting wilder and wilder.

One was addressed to his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez; one was addressed to their 4-year-old daughter, Avielle; and the third was addressed to an unnamed gay jailhouse lover who is reportedly now on an \u201ceyeball to eyeball\u201d suicide watch, according to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lover is allegedly the last person to speak to Hernandez before he took his own life, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe notes were reportedly found next to a Bible opened to John 3:16, the same Scripture that Hernandez is said to have had written on his forehead in marker and that reads: \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Hernandez had been planning his suicide for weeks and had even given away most of his personal belongings to other inmates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the report claims that Hernandez covered the floor of his cell in soap so that \u201cif he lost his nerve he wouldn\u2019t be able to save himself as he would slip around and not be able to land firmly on his feet.\u201d\n\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\n\u201cChief Medical Examiner Dr. Henry N. Nields performed an autopsy on Mr. Hernandez on Wednesday and concluded today that the manner of death was suicide and the cause asphyxia by hanging,\u201d stated Massachusetts District Attorney Joseph D. Early, Jr. in a statement on Thursday. \u201cAn investigation into the death by the State Police Detectives assigned to the District Attorney\u2019s Office and Department of Correction investigators found cardboard jammed into the door tracks of his single-inmate cell to impede entry into the cell.\u201d The report went on to state: \u201cThere were no signs of a struggle, and investigators determined that Mr. Hernandez was alone at the time of the hanging.\u201d \u201cMr. Hernandez was locked in his cell about 8 p.m. and no one entered the cell until a correction officer observed him at 3:03 a.m. and forced his way through the impeded door to render aid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported on The Root, Hernandez was acquitted of a double murder charge on April 14. He was already serving time after being convicted of the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd and was in the process of appealing that conviction when he took his own life sometime late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning.\n\nAccording to a statement issued Wednesday from Christopher Fallon, the assistant deputy commissioner of communications for the Massachusetts Department of Correction, Hernandez attempted to block his cell door from the inside by \u201cjamming the door with various items.\u201d\n\nThere has been no official word from prison officials on the alleged suicide notes, but the Daily Mail claims to have a source \u201cclose to the investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can take this report with a grain of salt, but if there is any validity to it and some other prisoner was distraught enough after Hernandez\u2019s death to be put on a suicide watch, it\u2019s safe to say that person could have been a lover.\n\nI love all of my friends dearly, and if any of them suddenly committed suicide, I would be sad, but I wouldn\u2019t be considering following in their footsteps.\n\nThat\u2019s something only a lover would consider doing.\n\nBut again, this is the Daily Mail we\u2019re talking about, so take this information as you will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Daily Mail.", "keywords": ["closeted", "suicide", "hernandez", "sources", "mail", "daily", "case", "addressed", "aaron", "cell", "report", "hernandezs", "lover", "sexuality", "motive", "murder"], "polarity": 0.05085674015906574, "subjectivity": 0.37389283197422746},

I want you all to think clearly about this: While the sharks of Russian collusion are closing in, the president of the United States of NASCAR lovers can\u2019t stop cozying up to the man whose country was involved in the hacking of America\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014the president of the people who shop at Abercrombie & Fitch can\u2019t stop following the Russian president around the club like an obsessive dude who purchased Putin a drink and now believes that they go together.\n\nHe.

It.\n\nAll of the intelligence services in the actual United States believe that Russia hacked America\u2019s election, and this man wants to break bread with the man who leads Russia.

And while all of America, including the press he adores, is baffled by his behavior, he won\u2019t stop.\n\nWhen The Root staff learned that Trump had, in fact, had a second undisclosed meeting with Putin, Deputy Editor Genetta Adams noted that there was one thing, and one thing only, that must be driving Trump\u2019s insistent need to swipe right for Russia: pee-pee tapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think she\u2019s right. Initially I thought the rumors that Trump paid Russian prostitutes to urinate on the bed in which former President Barack Obama had reportedly slept was funny. Now I think it\u2019s true. Putin must have something over Trump that is fueling this obsessive attraction to the leader of a country we don\u2019t fuck with. Historically, the United States and Russia have rarely been friends, which this president doesn\u2019t seem to understand. In fact, Trump isn\u2019t even trying to hide his love for Putin, and at this point, he just needs to come out and say it.\n\nTrump admitting that he has a thing for Putin would probably be less groundbreaking than the slow trickle of reports that amount to learning that Trump has stolen Papa Bannon\u2019s car so that he could sit in front of Putin\u2019s house to talk with him about love and stuff. They are together, and at this point, who are we to stop them?

The former New England Patriots star and convicted murderer was found dead in his prison cell Wednesday after having apparently hanged himself less than a week after being acquitted of a separate double murder charge in Boston.\n\nAlthough his attorney has launched an investigation into his death, believing that Hernandez may have been killed by either fellow inmates or prison officials, people on social media think perhaps Hernandez made one last game-winning play.\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, because Hernandez died while in the process of appealing his 2014 conviction of the murder of Odin Lloyd, that conviction has been essentially voided.\n\nFrom ProFootballTalk:\n\nHernandez was still in the process of appealing his 2014 conviction of murdering Odin Lloyd, which means a legal principle dating back to English common law called \u201cabatement ab initio\u201d applies to his case. \u201cAb initio\u201d translates to \u201cfrom the beginning\u201d and chief legal counsel to the Massachusetts Bar Association Michael Healy told the Boston Globe that the principle reverts a case to its start if the convicted party dies before the appeals process has concluded. Healy said that civil proceedings in other cases involving the death of the convicted party were complicated because evidence established in the criminal trial cannot be used to make the civil case. \u201cUnfortunately, in the Odin Lloyd matter, for the family, there won\u2019t be any real closure,\u201d Healy said. \u201cAaron Hernandez will go to his death an innocent man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means that Odin Lloyd\u2019s family would not be able to use evidence from the criminal trial in a lawsuit against the Hernandez estate for civil damages. But what about the money from his contract with the Patriots?\n\nA meme that began circulating on social media Thursday suggested that Hernandez killed himself so that his daughter could get the remainder of the $15 million that the Patriots owed him after severing his contract in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theory is that the abatement ab initio principle would also apply to his contract and the money remaining under it.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Boston Globe reports that it is unlikely the Hernandez family will be able to collect any money from the Patriots:\n\nBut the likely answer is simple: No, he is not. Even without a conviction on the books, Hernandez almost certainly was in breach of his contract. And it\u2019s a moot point, anyway. NFL Players Association records show that the Patriots and Hernandez settled a grievance that Hernandez filed in 2014. The settlement gave the Patriots a salary cap credit of $1.184 million, indicating a Patriots win. Additionally, according to Joel Corry\u2014an attorney, salary cap expert, and former NFL agent\u2014grievance settlements almost always tie up all loose ends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then:\n\nHowever, Hernandez will be able to draw an NFL pension. Article 53.6 of the CBA states that for players who began their careers before 2012, only three credited seasons are necessary to be vested in the league\u2019s retirement plan (now it\u2019s five years). Hernandez played three seasons before his arrest, so he will be eligible for the minimum pension payments. It is unclear whom Hernandez named as his beneficiary in case of death.\n\nFact-checking website Snopes goes a bit further, noting that Hernandez\u2019s contract was voided based on \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d and not a conviction:\n\nSpeculation holds that if Hernandez\u2019s conviction were vacated it would posthumously restore his standing with the NFL, thereby entitling his next of kin to the wealth he would have accumulated if he had never been convicted. But that speculation presumes that since the legal doctrine triggered by Hernandez\u2019s suicide could vacate his conviction, the NFL would somehow be bound by that outcome to pay out the contract\u2019s promises to his family. However, the NFL is a business entity and not a court of law, and Hernandez\u2019s contract was voided 90 minutes after his arrest based on \u201cconduct unbecoming,\u201d not on his conviction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only person who can tell us definitively why Hernandez may have taken his own life is no longer walking the earth. It\u2019s uncertain whether his daughter would be able to collect any money from his voided contract, but unlikely.\n\nIt appears her only likely recompense will be his NFL pension, if she is named as the beneficiary.\n\nThe abatement law may protect his estate from being used for criminal evidence in a civil action by the family of his victim, but it in no way guarantees a windfall for his daughter and family.", "keywords": ["taken", "law", "hernandez", "nfl", "contract", "daughter", "care", "patriots", "sure", "conviction", "kill", "odin", "speculation", "aaron", "family", "money", "hernandezs"], "polarity": 0.029692948560873088, "subjectivity": 0.41592479847196834},

This, despite 45 mentioning repeatedly over the span of years that he met Putin. And all week, many anchors, pundits and political reporters asked silly questions about how 45 will engage Putin. Will he bring up Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election? If not, is it a sign of his weakness as a leader? Would such a move further reduce America\u2019s standing in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been like watching a child-left-behind-themed reboot of Ghostwriter. These are not complicated questions, and there is no point pretending otherwise in the name of \u201cobjectivity,\u201d \u201cbalance\u201d or whatever other bullshit phrasing used to convey playing dumb. Why would Sweet Potato Saddam tell Putin before the entire world that the United States will not stand for Russian interference in our sovereignty when he\u2019s made it abundantly clear that he doesn\u2019t care? If anything, 45 hopes they will do it again because, if coupled with voter suppression, surely he can win re-election.\n\n\n\nTrue to form, when asked about it a day prior to meeting his Russian BFF, 45 talked in circles per his usual. You see, Russia probably interfered in the election, but we don\u2019t know for sure because something about the Iraq War; although if they did interfere, it\u2019s former President Barack Obama\u2019s fault for not stopping it because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election. 45 treats Obama\u2019s sac like his personal swing, so it\u2019s only fitting that he once again found a way to fault Obama for Vladimir\u2019s actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is the real answer? The hell if 45 knows or, at the very least, has any will to say. I wonder what could be preventing such an admission. Let me turn on Dave Chappelle\u2019s \u201cPiss on You\u201d and ponder a bit more.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, we know that 45 was never going to cop to Russian meddling on his behalf when he\u2019s still trying to convince the public that he would have won the popular vote if not for 3 million to 5 million illegal voters who exist only inside that forest fire of a brain he has. Why did anyone ever bother to pretend otherwise?\n\nSo now that everyone is caught up, yes, it means that 45 is a weak leader for what many have rightfully referred to as a \u201cdereliction of duty,\u201d and of course, the cowardly act makes America look even smaller on the world stage.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for their meeting, a live adaptation of Pinocchio, look at the glee in 45\u2019s eyes. He looks ready to climax. For those who were hoping for a public scolding: Bless y\u2019all\u2019s hearts. 45 looked ready to ask Putin, \u201cHow do you like your eggs, zaddy?\u201d in Russian.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 45-Putin meeting was scheduled to last only 30 minutes but went well over two hours. What did they talk about? Well, it\u2019s unlikely that 45 or Secretary of State Blanche Devereaux\u2019s Ex-Boyfriend will share any real details, even if it\u2019s easy to take notes while on one\u2019s knees. Putin probably played 45 for the narcissistic simpleton he is as the secretary of state tapped his feet waiting for Russian sanctions to be lifted so that Exxon can cash out. That said, the Russian state-run outlet Sputnik reports that Putin and 45 discussed Ukraine, Syria, the fight against terrorism and cybersecurity.\n\nSo the Ukraine is theirs, Syria will be handled however they see fit, the same goes for terrorism and \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018cybersecurity,\u2019 comrade?\u201d\n\n\n\nPutin has helped installed a mindless reality star and longtime scammer as the head of state of his broke-bitch nation\u2019s greatest adversary, but while it is fair to make him the international bogeyman, the reality is, hordes of white folks voted for 45 for no other reason than that they wanted to feel good about being white. It\u2019s called \u201ccultural anxiety,\u201d but that\u2019s merely business-casual dressing for \u201cracism.\u201d These people wanted to feel so good about being white that they elected a fool with no real love of America and its principles. They continue to be excused although their votes have made it abundantly clear that they love this country far less than the very \u201cothers\u201d they believe are wrecking it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo many of us\u2014including the last U.S. president\u2014have been called unpatriotic for far fewer offenses (or none at all). Yet this bloated orange soda can of a man stood among the world\u2019s richest nations and cowered to Russia\u2019s despot, and he still won\u2019t be called out as the traitor that he is. I suppose I could ask why, but that would be as silly a question as wondering all week how 45 would act when he\u2019s made his plans all too clear.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "russian", "president", "45", "week", "putin", "meeting", "real", "benefactor", "white", "expected", "hes", "political", "yalls", "behaved", "state"], "polarity": 0.09964204545454547, "subjectivity": 0.43950347222222225},

The prison-industrial complex and the various ways it promotes the profiteering of black and brown bodies\u2014coupled with lack of mental and emotional support, sexual violence and shoddy investigations into reported abuses\u2014must be held responsible for its complicity in violence and death.\n\n\n\nJust days after Hernandez was acquitted in a double-murder case, the convicted murderer and former New England Patriots tight end was found hanged in his Massachusetts prison cell. It\u2019s hard to rally around him, since many wouldn\u2019t consider him the perfect victim; and he wasn\u2019t. Hernandez was already incarcerated for the June 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. He was also incredibly smug and had never seemed apologetic for taking someone\u2019s life. But thankfully, social justice doesn\u2019t rest on the ability to speak out only for those who seem perfect. It\u2019s about consistently calling out systems of oppression that abuse power, leading to death and improper investigations.\n\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t even about defending or protecting Hernandez inasmuch as it is about recognizing the complicity of prison systems in promoting violence, particularly when suicides, murders and cover-ups are involved.\n\n\n\nIn her 2016 book, Freedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement, Angela Davis discusses that globally, in order to solve problems, the judicial system merely sends people to prison\u2014and then does nothing else. No focus on upbringing, employment, redistribution of resources or wealth, or promoting restorative justice. Davis notes: \u201c[I]n prison, they find themselves within a violent institution that reproduces violence. In many ways you can say that the institution feeds on that violence and reproduces it so that when the person is released he or she is probably worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s start there.\n\n\n\nThe prison system doesn\u2019t attempt to solve problems because that would entail looking at cause and effect; so, instead, prisons exacerbate them. Prisons have always been in a state of reform, in part because the focus is never on looking for root causes of why people commit crimes\u2014including lack of social services, racism, unavailability of mental-illness prevention and treatment, unemployment, poverty, homelessness; instead, prosecutors quickly charge, and judges and juries swiftly lock people up, to solve a perceived problem.\n\n\n\nPrisons are violent. We know this, but that fact is rarely taken into account before defendants are sentenced to long sentences that will cost taxpayers billions of dollars. We also know that prisons are intentionally designed to dehumanize and demoralize human beings, often going beyond punishment. Try as I might, it rarely shocks me when I hear of prison suicides (other than Bland\u2019s, because her mistreatment\u2014from stop to arrest to custody\u2014was unconstitutional from law enforcement\u2019s initial interaction). Given that the American prison system is violent in itself, it is no longer shocking that a person would attempt to escape.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrisons and jails are obligated to safeguard inmates from harm, but the chances of that happening are slim when the prisons are the institutions causing harm. State prisons and local jails are so violent that data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics not only shows an uptick in deaths but also underscores that in 2015, local jails were the leading cause of death for U.S. inmates. It\u2019s clear that these are not spaces where those experiencing incarceration can return and be productive members of society. What\u2019s worse, because we have already decided that they shouldn\u2019t receive proper treatment, many of us ignore how marginalized people outside of prisons receive double the harsh treatment inside them.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s critical because if prison systems can lead to the death of people like Hernandez, then it really means death for system-oppressed people, such as black and brown women and LGBTQ folks. What I\u2019m not saying is that society must start paying attention to the problems of prison systems because of what recently occurred with Hernandez; my arc of justice will never bend toward straight, wealthy men who never center black queer and transgender people.\n\n\n\nI am, however, saying that our history has tended to value straight men more than women, LGBTQ individuals and those outside the margins. That leaves me wondering: If we haven\u2019t recognized the problem when it has affected straight men, will we ever notice it for less marginalized populations? Likely not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis makes even more sense when we think about the widespread sexual violence that LGBTQ people experience in prison. In 2011 the book Queer (In)justice: The Criminalization of LGBT People in the United States, one of the first reports to underscore gender and sexual minorities\u2019 prison experiences, highlighted that although sexual abuse is a common prison experience for many inmates, it is LGBTQ inmates who are disproportionately targeted. We also know that transgender inmates suffer violence at the hands of staff and fellow inmates. Not only are many denied hormone therapy, but many are placed in housing counter to how they identify, already a form of violence.\n\n\n\nFive years ago, I thought that reform was possible for all prisons. I have since learned that before reform, there must be the understanding of why change is even required. We are not yet there. Prisons are violent; they reproduce violence; they are homophobic; and rape occurs. Prisons and jails are a microcosm of the toxicity that we see outside of prisons; we must scrutinize the need for them\u2014regardless of inmates and their offenses.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what happened to Hernandez on Wednesday night. Could he have committed suicide? Certainly. Could it be part of the same scheme designed by global capitalism, with prisons (and staff) being its highest bidder? Yes. But it\u2019s critical to realize that these two questions are not mutually exclusive because, regardless, prisons\u2019 complicity in violence leads to the same answer every time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreston Mitchum is a Washington, D.C.-based writer, activist and policy nerd.

Oh, and apparently \u201cmany in the Kremlin believed that Trump viewed the presidency as a business.\u201d\n\nI wonder whether this dossier\u2014compiled by retired diplomats and Putin staff members\u2014also tells us the color of the sky.\n\n\n\nIts intent, it is said, is to properly prep Putin for his first meeting with 45. However, considering the growing evidence that 45 is the mutt he helped housebreak into the White House, you would think he would already be quite familiar with a man who literally is inescapable within media.

That is Jones, and much like Jones, 45 enjoys being loud, wrong and crazy.\n\n\n\nWe live in a free country until the Colby-Jack F\u00fchrer declares otherwise, but Vladimir, you can\u2019t trust anyone that stupid to do anything for you, no matter how much piss-stained footage you may or may not have on him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is Politico\u2019s \u201cHow Trump\u2019s Campaign Staffers Tried to Keep Him Off Twitter,\u201d which deep-dives into how those poor, unfortunate, soulless individuals often tried in vain to keep their then-candidate from live-tweeting the presidential election to often disastrous results.\n\n\n\nFormer Communications Director Sam Nunberg explained:\n\n\n\nIf candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable. The same media that our base digests and prefers is going to be the base for his support. I would assume the president would like to see positive and preferential treatment from those outlets and that would help the operation overall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, Put-Put (if I can call you that, Vlad), if you want to stay on 45\u2019s good side, always retweet him. Hell, favorite his tweets, too. Make him feel special. That should help. Well, temporarily, anyway. He\u2019s going to turn on you anyway. Ask Ivana Trump. Or Marla Maples. Or Melania Trump when her pussy-grabbing husband isn\u2019t hovering over her.

I don\u2019t believe in the adage \u201cTrust no bitch,\u201d but Put-Put, don\u2019t trust that bitch. Not to get anything done, anyway\u2014particularly when his approval ratings are lower than the Grammy Awards are with black women, gay black men and people with taste.\n\nIt seems that part of this dossier is rooted in just such growing concern. NBC reports:\n\nPutin\u2019s government is growing increasingly concerned about Trump\u2019s battles in Washington, according to Fedorov and former lawmaker Sergei Markov, who remains well-connected at the Kremlin. It is worried the president will not have the political power to improve relations with Russia, as he has indicated he might try to do, and even, perhaps, lift some U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut-Put is beginning to worry that Honeysuckle Lenin won\u2019t be able to do much in the way of boosting Russia\u2019s raggedy ass on the global stage. That explains why the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is accusing various mainstream media outlets of spreading fake news about Muva Russia.\n\nVia CNN:\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the project was aimed at countering an \u201cinformation campaign aimed against Russia\u201d by exposing false statements from leading foreign media outlets and officials. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Zakharova said stories about Moscow\u2019s attempts to hack foreign elections and Russian submarines operating in northern Europe were examples of such fake news.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Russia\u2019s little intel operation seeking to influence elections in Western elections is starting to backfire.

Kimmel then asked if she signed the denial letter, to which Daniels evasively replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, did I? Doesn\u2019t look like my signature, does it?\u201d\n\nKimmel then asked if she knew where the letter came from and if she had authorized its release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt came from the internet.\u201d\n\nNice.

But he pressed on, trying to get Daniels to give him something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play \u2018Never have I ever,\u2019\u201d Kimmel told Daniels. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask a few questions about various things.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe quickly responded, \u201cThis feels like an \u2018SVU\u2019 episode [of Law & Order].\u201d\n\nDaniels kept playing dodgeball. She didn\u2019t answer anything; the whole episode was a wash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStormy, one last thing,\u201d Kimmel said, wrapping up the telecast. \u201cHave you ever made love to anyone whose name rhymes with \u2018Ronald Rump\u2019?\u201d\n\n\n\nDaniels smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you whatever you want me to, baby.\u201d\n\nUggghhhh.

It has from the beginning, and two of the major offenses have been the administration\u2019s obvious ties to Cousin Putin and lying. The entire campaign and presidency up to this point have had to answer questions about both, so it seems a little disingenuous that national security adviser Michael Flynn would resign from his post for lying about Russia.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, reports began swirling that Flynn lied to officials about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. It was also noted that Flynn may have been in danger of being blackmailed by the Russians, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cI inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,\u201d Flynn wrote in his resignation letter, obtained by CNN.\n\n\n\nBut here is the thing: Everyone in this administration, including President Pee-Pee, is vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians because this isn\u2019t even real life anymore; it\u2019s a bad episode of House of Cards, and the actors in this drama are a lot less appealing.\n\nSo it\u2019s all coming out in the wash as Flynn takes one for the team. Did he talk with Russia about lifting sanctions imposed by then-President Barack Obama (pour a little out) for Russia\u2019s involvement in the presidential election?

Lots and lots of pain. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be like a Betty Wright track in which said pain will yield some gain. It will just hurt.\n\n\n\nThere will also be plenty of stupidity because if the confirmation hearings are any indication, we will be beset by inept buffoons, who, much like the 45th president of the United States, have absolutely no business doing the jobs with which they have been tasked.\n\nOf course, there will be loads of corruption because when you elect a con man to the highest office in the land, he\u2019s going to give you your money\u2019s worth.\n\nHowever, of all the nuisances that await us, one that\u2019s increasingly sticking out to me is that we will be embarking on having the political Ike and Tina Turner in Mango Zedong (Donald Trump) and Vladimir Putin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor quite some time now, Frack and Fuck-Up have been whispering sweet nothings to each other in the public space, reminding me of a Drake song in which he is oh so smitten, only to end up vexed over the fact that she has dared to have a life aside from him.\n\nIf previous comments are any indication, these two will very much behave like a celebrity couple desperately trying to sway you into giving a damn about their union. Recently, Geppetto (Putin) took up for his new boo thang (Mango Zedong) by addressing the now infamous dossier in which a former MI6 British intelligence agent claims that the Russian government has compromising information about the new U.S. president. During a press conference Tuesday, Putin said, \u201cThese things that have been alleged are clearly false information.\u201d\n\n(Because if you want truth, you turn to a man trained in the art of lying like hell for the advancement of specific agents.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the various forms of malarkey the lying head of state presented to a forced audience, though, this portion was particularly comical: \u201cDid Trump really come and meet with Moscow prostitutes? Firstly, he is an adult, and secondly, he is a person who for many years has organized a beauty pageant, socialized with the most beautiful women in the world. It is hard to believe that he ran to a hotel to meet with our girls of a low social class, although they are the best in the world.\u201d\n\nThis is not how prostitution works, but it\u2019s clearly a sign of someone standing by his man. I suppose if the former KGB agent allegedly put in all that effort to housebreak his new pet, it would make sense for him to go above and beyond to protect him. You know, even if that means saying with a straight face that loads of women want to smash a man who looks like a pot of lasagna made from old slices of Kraft cheese.\n\nStill, it was already stomach-churning to watch an American campaigning to be president laud an authoritarian figure from a hostile foreign government, but now we have to spend maybe four years living with this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the crowds in Washington, D.C., were thin-crust pizza for the inauguration, it was apparently a lituation over in Moscow. Indeed, The Independent reported that supporters of Putin held an all-night party in celebration of the U.S. president who U.S. intelligence agencies all agree benefited from the assistance of the Russian government in winning the presidential election.\n\nAdam Lusher wrote: \u201cOne of the organizers, Konstantin Rykov, who has served as a Russian MP affiliated to Putin\u2019s United Russia Party and has also been described as a \u2018Kremlin web propagandist,\u2019 invited his Facebook followers to the event with the comment: \u2018See you in the evening. Washington will be ours.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite the new administration\u2019s claims to the contrary, we undoubtedly will soon have to bear the sight of Mango Zedong and Putin standing side-by-side in jubilee like they\u2019re Ja Rule and Ashanti about to perform \u201cAlways on Time.\u201d While there is a special shade of irony in the guy who promised to \u201cMake America great again\u201d being so clingy to the de facto dictator of Russia, it is not enough to gloss over how infuriating it is to see such a low-level ruse happen in real time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor far too long, black folks have had their patriotism questioned. This would include the first black president of the United States, who has shown far greater faith in this nation than it arguably deserves. Yet this wealthy, spoiled white man has had everything handed to him in life (or he swindled it from people without serious repercussions), and still he refuses to criticize someone who has shown nothing but contempt for the country he\u2019s been elected to run.

Now a new report raises questions as to whether there is more to Trump\u2019s history with Daniels than just a one-time encounter.\n\nJacob Weisberg reports on Slate that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told him that she\u2019d had an affair with Trump that began after she met him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2006. The sexual relationship continued for nearly a year, according to her account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring her conversations with Weisberg\u2014which took place between August and October 2016\u2014Daniels said that she could describe things about Trump that only someone who had seen him naked would know, and contrary to what Marla Maples is supposed to have said, Trump was not that great in bed.\n\nTrump allegedly made several unkept promises to Daniels, telling her that he would buy her a condo in Tampa, Fla., and that he would feature her in a season of Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels told Weisberg that she had proof of the affair. She had the phone numbers of Trump\u2019s longtime personal assistant Rhonda Graff and his bodyguard Keith Schiller, who helped her arrange rendezvous with Trump.\n\nFrom Slate:\n\nGiven what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didn\u2019t think an extramarital affair would be a highly significant story. What interested me more was Daniels\u2019 allegation that Trump had negotiated to buy her silence. Daniels said that, through intermediaries, she and Trump had worked out an agreement for the presidential candidate to pay her a six-figure sum to keep quiet. More specifically, she said her lawyer Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hills\u2013based attorney who specializes in claims against celebrities, had worked out the terms with Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time Daniels spoke with Weisberg, she indicated that she believed Trump was stalling on the agreement to pay her the $130,000.\n\nA week after the 2016 election, she stopped returning calls, and a friend of hers told Weisberg that she had, in fact, taken the money from Trump.\n\nSounds messy, but it also sounds just like Trump.

The newspaper also noted that the adult-film star had been in talks with Good Morning America and that the National Enquirer had agreed to pay Clifford for a story about her relationship with Trump. However, the tabloid newspaper didn\u2019t publish the story and says that the company paid Clifford to write fitness columns and appear on magazine covers, the Journal reports.\n\nClifford didn\u2019t respond to multiple emails from the Journal seeking comment, but Cohen emailed the Journal back a response using an all-caps subject line\u2014TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN\u2014and signed by \u201cStormy Daniels,\u201d denying that she had a \u201csexual and/or romantic affair\u201d with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople with knowledge of the agreement told the Journal that Clifford actually considered ending the deal because her payment was taking too long.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Journal describes the transaction:\n\nThe payment was made to Ms. Clifford through her lawyer in the matter, Keith Davidson, with funds sent to Mr. Davidson\u2019s client-trust account at City National Bank in Los Angeles, according to the people. \u201cI previously represented Ms. Daniels,\u201d Mr. Davidson said, referring to Ms. Clifford\u2019s stage name. \u201cAttorney-client privilege prohibits me from commenting on my clients\u2019 legal matters.\u201d A spokeswoman for City National Bank declined to comment.

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad.

Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["solved", "didnt", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "article", "dont", "person", "think", "mailbag", "black", "better"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh ....

Also, your previous letter calling staff writer Monique Judge \u201cone of the most racist bitches to ever breath [sic]\u201d was in all capital letters. Your embrace of lowercase letters shows growth (we\u2019re still working on the ellipses, but that\u2019s a lesson you learn in sixth-grade grammar; you\u2019ll get there), but what I\u2019d like to know is:\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nWho hurt you, j40? Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it. She will do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, about ... something:\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nFrom: David\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Repent Michael you are a person of the baser sort who is so full of hatred and ungodliness that you cannot even think clearly. Your articles are so vile and disgusting and you are so full of yourself that you cannot even have any other thoughts than the ones you deceive yourself into thinking you are always right. You will have your judgement day and, as you kneel before the Lord Jesus Christ on that day, you will realize how foolish you were. It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb. I know it probably doesn\u2019t say \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d my Lord, and I know there\u2019s something about false prophets, but Imma ride with the \u201cno bigot\u201d thing for the rest of this prayer, Jesus.\n\nYour Highness, I thank you for saving me from choking when he talked about how great Trump is and said Barack Obama did \u201cterrible and corrupt things.\u201d\n\nLord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to erase the notion that almost every time someone says they\u2019re not racist, then brings up Chicago, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and transgender bathrooms, they always turn out to be racist, Lord. But not David, sweet Jesus. He is your servant! He has shown me the love of Jesus, precious Father!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, I pray.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd for our positive mail, I will give you a few pieces of mail I have featuring one recurring theme that we often receive: suggestions for names to call white people:\n\nFrom: Milkshakedave\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Two things: Dear Mr. Harriot, In your March 2 Clapback Mailbag, I read the following: \u201c...they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\u201d Your assertion has been the only one I\u2019ve read that has come remotely close to explaining what I\u2019ve felt for the last couple of years is at the centre of the Trumpling mindset. (As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot.

When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump.

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["solved", "didnt", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "article", "dont", "person", "think", "mailbag", "black", "better"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis. But Obama\u2019s simple existence pulled down America\u2019s pants and exposed its flaccid inferiority complex to the world.\n\nBut Joe, it\u2019s not your fault that you were born that way.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["racist", "clapback", "obama", "roots", "blame", "white", "know", "mike", "way", "dont", "world", "mailbag", "mama", "black", "race"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh .... Goof Grief! Oh ...... good grief....... the little girl looking at the so called portrait of Michelle Obutthole was just trying to figure out who the hell it was ....as the portrait looks NOTHING like Michelle Obutthole! Give us a break.... will you???? We are tired of hearing about the Obuttholes. ... worst damn administration to EVER darken the door of the Whitehouse. Really, Toots, you little millennial cupcakes are the scurge upon this great country! TRY TO GROW THE HELL UP!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nj40oaks:\n\nFirst, I want to congratulate you on becoming the first person to have a repeat appearance in the mailbag. Also, your previous letter calling staff writer Monique Judge \u201cone of the most racist bitches to ever breath [sic]\u201d was in all capital letters. Your embrace of lowercase letters shows growth (we\u2019re still working on the ellipses, but that\u2019s a lesson you learn in sixth-grade grammar; you\u2019ll get there), but what I\u2019d like to know is:\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nWho hurt you, j40? Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it. She will do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, about ... something:\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nFrom: David\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Repent Michael you are a person of the baser sort who is so full of hatred and ungodliness that you cannot even think clearly. Your articles are so vile and disgusting and you are so full of yourself that you cannot even have any other thoughts than the ones you deceive yourself into thinking you are always right. You will have your judgement day and, as you kneel before the Lord Jesus Christ on that day, you will realize how foolish you were. It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb. I know it probably doesn\u2019t say \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d my Lord, and I know there\u2019s something about false prophets, but Imma ride with the \u201cno bigot\u201d thing for the rest of this prayer, Jesus.\n\nYour Highness, I thank you for saving me from choking when he talked about how great Trump is and said Barack Obama did \u201cterrible and corrupt things.\u201d\n\nLord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to erase the notion that almost every time someone says they\u2019re not racist, then brings up Chicago, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and transgender bathrooms, they always turn out to be racist, Lord. But not David, sweet Jesus. He is your servant! He has shown me the love of Jesus, precious Father!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, I pray.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd for our positive mail, I will give you a few pieces of mail I have featuring one recurring theme that we often receive: suggestions for names to call white people:\n\nFrom: Milkshakedave\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Two things: Dear Mr. Harriot, In your March 2 Clapback Mailbag, I read the following: \u201c...they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\u201d Your assertion has been the only one I\u2019ve read that has come remotely close to explaining what I\u2019ve felt for the last couple of years is at the centre of the Trumpling mindset. (As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot. I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump.

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["solved", "didnt", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "article", "dont", "person", "think", "mailbag", "black", "better"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

We\u2019re not all racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe: But it literally says in the title that I\u2019m not referring to all white people. Only the ones who ...\n\nWypipo: Racist!\n\nMe: [Sigh.]\n\nWypipo: Why are you so quiet? It is because you\u2019re racist?\n\nSo today we thought we\u2019d have a very special episode of the Clapback Mailbag and present to you a cross section of emails, tweets, messages and comments about one article, and there will only be one clapback at the very end. Some of them are unhinged, so buckle your seat belts:\n\nFrom: utterback7125\n\nTo: The Root\n\nSubject: Fuck You You\u2019re the fucking problem with America today. You cause nothing but more racial division. You all make many Americans fucking sick to their stomachs, and we wish you\u2019d crash and burn. You\u2019re the fucking racist fascists.\n\nName Zachary A.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject Black Panther post Message I\u2019m not sure why you wrote this, but the reluctancy should have kept, because you sound like a racist idiot. I\u2019m not sure that your rant was much better than Ben Shapiro\u2019s, because you both spew shit from your cloudy and skewed perspectives. Also Gal Gadot is not \u201cBrazilian or something\u201d, that\u2019s a derogatory thing to say and shows your true ignorance. So fuck you, and I hope your writing career ends soon. (not that you have any real articles anyway)\n\nFrom: Jason\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Plea I came across your \u201copen letter\u201d via my Google feed. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people. I have common sense. I don\u2019t lump all people of color based on lack of common Sense of the few. Famous or vocal does not equal common sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the coup de grace:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: I\u2019m NOT THE RACIST. SEEMS YOU ARE Slept w& fell in love w/an African American and had a child. Did I give up on that child cause at that particular time, 30,some ought years ago that was not so very much liked? I lived &STILL live in that same neighborhood. Yes, it\u2019s a weathly neighborhood, buy I could care less about that. Thankfully, most of those people who said that to ME about MY child, have now passed on. R.I.P TO THEM CAUSE THEY\u2019LL NEED IT WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER JESUS CHRIST. U HAVE TO GO THROUGH JESUS CHRIST TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW THAT, DID YOU? I know for a fact that I and my now HANDSOME WEALTHY WHITE HUSBAND are NOT RACIST. VERY FAR FROM IT. FROM WHAT I read in that 1 article,that just popped up on my phone, I simply found YOU JUST HATING WHITE PEOPLE. The white people I & My husband know are SO FAR AWAY FROM BEING RACIST, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN LAUGHABLE. But for YOU to call ME a RACIST IS SO BEYOND FUNNY, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN FUNNY. Unfortunately, by YOU CALLING ME A RACIST, MAKES YOU ONE. If you really want to GO FOR it, DO YOU GET TO HANG OUT WITH THE ROLLING STONES? BET YOU DON\u2019T. AND YES,MY HUSBAND &I HAVE BEEN ON THEIR PRIVATE JET. I HAVE LITERAL PICTURES. Darryl Jones is one of the most kind gentlemen I\u2019ve ever met. I care 4u cause I feel so sad for you. I\u2019ll bet money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST? Right? Yes,and my husband and I are the HOLLOWAYS. AND YES WE DO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, CAUSE IT\u2019S THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. WHAT\u2019S GOING TO COME OUT YOUR RACIST MOUTH NOW? I can only wonder? THE HOLLOWAYS.....And YES I\u2019ll bet I have MORE money than you do. NOT that it matters, but I\u2019ll bet IT does to YOU? Right?Again.....The HOLLOWAYS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I didn\u2019t answer, she wrote back:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael harriot\n\nSubject: I just reported you for calling me A RACIST. NO ONE CALLS ME A RACIST! I Will bet you money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST. I can practically guarantee you know nothing about JESUS CHRIST/GOD.Do u know how to get into HEAVEN?I guarantee you do not. I will pray for you,cause I already feel & know YOU need help extremely badly. I already know that you will not send me back a comment. Right? Mrs.HOLLOWAY. AND how DARE you call the HOLLOWAYS -BITCH? We ARE a Famous family that you will NEVER hear of. We are quite people. PERIOD.\n\nOK, guys, as one of the world\u2019s foremost reverse racists, I would never diminish your pain. Although I would chop off my left pinky toe for the privilege of scanning the landscape of everything that offends me and black people and deciding that the biggest act of racism is an article about a movie about a fictional character in a fictional country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nBut I\u2019ll be honest with you guys: I\u2019m not tired of you. Your words affect me in no way, and there is a very good reason why:\n\nEven though I think the fragility of Caucasians and their unwillingness to dismantle or accept their part in creating and upholding a worldwide system of evil, oppression and hate is hilarious, it is not overwhelming. The Root receives far more positive correspondences from people\u2014both black and white\u2014who appreciate the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you that I will not be clapping back this week. Instead, I have outsourced this week\u2019s clapback to these three individuals:\n\nFrom: Susie\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thank You Michael, I just want to send my thanks to you because I have learned so much by reading your articles. I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["feel", "secondhand", "racist", "michael", "writing", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "im", "article", "dont", "clapbacks", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes?

I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly.

He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike.

Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["racist", "clapback", "obama", "roots", "blame", "white", "know", "mike", "way", "dont", "world", "mailbag", "mama", "black", "race"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh .... Goof Grief! Oh ...... good grief....... the little girl looking at the so called portrait of Michelle Obutthole was just trying to figure out who the hell it was ....as the portrait looks NOTHING like Michelle Obutthole! Give us a break.... will you???? We are tired of hearing about the Obuttholes. ... worst damn administration to EVER darken the door of the Whitehouse. Really, Toots, you little millennial cupcakes are the scurge upon this great country! TRY TO GROW THE HELL UP!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nj40oaks:\n\nFirst, I want to congratulate you on becoming the first person to have a repeat appearance in the mailbag. Also, your previous letter calling staff writer Monique Judge \u201cone of the most racist bitches to ever breath [sic]\u201d was in all capital letters. Your embrace of lowercase letters shows growth (we\u2019re still working on the ellipses, but that\u2019s a lesson you learn in sixth-grade grammar; you\u2019ll get there), but what I\u2019d like to know is:\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nWho hurt you, j40? Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it. She will do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, about ... something:\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nFrom: David\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Repent Michael you are a person of the baser sort who is so full of hatred and ungodliness that you cannot even think clearly. Your articles are so vile and disgusting and you are so full of yourself that you cannot even have any other thoughts than the ones you deceive yourself into thinking you are always right. You will have your judgement day and, as you kneel before the Lord Jesus Christ on that day, you will realize how foolish you were. It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb. I know it probably doesn\u2019t say \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d my Lord, and I know there\u2019s something about false prophets, but Imma ride with the \u201cno bigot\u201d thing for the rest of this prayer, Jesus.\n\nYour Highness, I thank you for saving me from choking when he talked about how great Trump is and said Barack Obama did \u201cterrible and corrupt things.\u201d\n\nLord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to erase the notion that almost every time someone says they\u2019re not racist, then brings up Chicago, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and transgender bathrooms, they always turn out to be racist, Lord. But not David, sweet Jesus. He is your servant! He has shown me the love of Jesus, precious Father!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, I pray.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd for our positive mail, I will give you a few pieces of mail I have featuring one recurring theme that we often receive: suggestions for names to call white people:\n\nFrom: Milkshakedave\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Two things: Dear Mr. Harriot, In your March 2 Clapback Mailbag, I read the following: \u201c...they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\u201d Your assertion has been the only one I\u2019ve read that has come remotely close to explaining what I\u2019ve felt for the last couple of years is at the centre of the Trumpling mindset. (As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot. I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump.

This week\u2019s roundup of emails, comments, tweets and direct messages comes from white people who aren\u2019t racist; they just want the writers at The Root to stick to facts.\n\nFor insight, we collected a few of the people who set aside their disdain for our obvious lack of intelligence so that they could educate us on the truth. We wanted to highlight these unseen contributors as a way of thanking them for their continued support. Without you, where would we be?\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail.\n\nOur first set of correspondence doesn\u2019t relate to any particular post. In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "white", "racism", "crime", "lincoln", "facts", "mailbag", "black", "stop"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

It started with the election of President Barack Obama, who invented racism in a Kenyan laboratory with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Saul Alinsky and that terrorist dude from the Weather Underground. (I know his name is Bill Ayers. I\u2019m just using his white-people name.)\n\nEver since Obama released this terrible plague into our society, people much smarter than I have been trying to solve the racism riddle and banish it from the planet. They\u2019ve tried sensitivity training, revising history to make the Civil War about states\u2019 rights and\u2014most notably\u2014developing an antidote called \u201creverse racism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the scientists here at The Root have finally figured out a cure. Our researchers ran our most racist emails, tweets, comments and direct messages through our proprietary software and analyzed the results. They detected a pattern that shows racism is inversely proportional to the ability to spell, capitalize and punctuate.\n\nYes, the cure for racism is grammar lessons.\n\nToday we share our peer-reviewed study. (Although, to be fair, Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan does not consider me her peer.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Wait .. I thought you said \u2018pear.\u2019 No, I don\u2019t consider you my pear. \u2014Yesha]\n\n(Sidenote: Instead of including our positive emails at the end, this week they will be used as control subjects for our data comparisons.)\n\nHere are our results:\n\nIn our first test case, we examined the responses to our article on O.J. Simpson:\n\nFrom: Connor\n\nTo: Michael Harriot you are such a smug racist spewing piece of shit. Don\u2019t hate white people of this generation you fuck; we did\u2019nt do shit to you or your race. stop spewing hate. the fact you celebrated OJ\u2019s acquittal shows how dumb you are. karmas a bitch. really hope someone doesn\u2019t murder someone close to you. imagine that feeling you narcissistic fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an example of our typical racist reader. Notice the lack of capitalization at the beginning of each sentence, something most people learn in their early elementary school years. While I am thankful for his hope that someone close to me isn\u2019t murdered, I question his use of a semicolon instead of a period. It could be a mistake, but when I combine that oversight with the fact that he misplaced an apostrophe in \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and just eliminated the one in \u201ckarma\u2019s,\u201d it shows how grammar has affected his mind state.\n\nNone of this indicates that the reader is dumb because\u2014wonder of wonders\u2014he didn\u2019t misspell \u201cnarcissistic.\u201d Plus, unlike some of our most racist readers, he didn\u2019t sprinkle ellipses throughout his message.\n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at a thread from a Twitter user who doesn\u2019t appear to be racist:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Sarah, in her egalitarian white feminism, simply wanted to inject her narrative into an article that had nothing to do with her. She wanted to discuss sexism in an article that was specifically about police brutality and black lives. She wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist. She was exemplifying the white privilege that seeks to change every conversation and divert it to a subject she wants to talk about. As such, her only mistake (other than a comma instead of a semicolon after \u201cI understand you\u201d) was spelling \u201csay\u201d as \u201cday.\u201d\n\nSee ... not as racist, better grammar.\n\nAnd, finally, this:\n\nFrom: Edith\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I really enjoyed your article on OJ. I guess I\u2019m one of the few white Americans who really thought he was innocent. I recorded but haven\u2019t watched the Fox News interview but I will now very soon. I like to think that everyone judges people by their character and not the color of their skin but I know I\u2019m wrong. At 67 it is hard to understand why in this day and age color is still so harsh a feeling by some people. I grew up while the civil rights movement was in full force and saw the injustices that were going on in Selma. I guess I have spent my life wearing those 60\u2019s \u201cRose Colored Glasses\u201d but it was easier than reality.\n\nWe now have a man in the Oval Office (I refuse to call him President) who does nothing but preach hate belittles people. He is doing everything in his power to destroy all the good things that President Obama accomplished. I voted for President Obama twice and would have voted for him a third time if I could have had that privilege. I\u2019m praying constantly for impeachment but I\u2019m not sure it will happen.\n\nI work with black women that are some of the greatest women I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of knowing. We are all nurses and they are great. How anyone can judge a person by their color instead of their character is beyond my school of thought. Throughout my career as a nurse I have had the honor of taking care of many people of color that were amazing. I have heard of the difficulties of being black from the 1930\u2019s and onward. Some stories were absolutely fascinating while others just ripped your heart out. I can\u2019t imagine how black people felt with the way they were treated.\n\nI\u2019m also very proud that I have never treated anyone the way blacks have been treated. I think my parents had a great deal to do with that. I know you probably won\u2019t read all of this and I can\u2019t say I\u2019d blame you if you didn\u2019t but I wanted you to know there are some people out here who grew up in your parents or grandparents day that didn\u2019t grow up thinking they were better than people of color. My daddy use to tell my brother and me that \u201cthere was not one person in the world better than we were and there isn\u2019t one person in the world that we are better than anyone\u201d. I just know that if we remove our skin we all look the same.\n\nYou, Mr. Harriot, have managed to be the person that I elected to send my rants and raves at because of that dummy in the Oval Office, he is the one person that we are all better than. I get so angry at his actions I find myself hoping he will meet his Lee Harvey Oswald soon and I know that\u2019s not right.\n\nPlease know that believe it or not I don\u2019t write people like this but your writing was really great. I know you have probably turned blue at the length of some of my sentences but that\u2019s ok, you\u2019re right. Keep up the good work and please pray for a Democrat win EVERYWHERE.\n\nThanks for listening. God Bless.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nEdith\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not trying to grammar-shame anyone, but this is from a white woman. Notice that\u2014instead of saying that she doesn\u2019t see color\u2014she acknowledges the fact that she can actually tell the difference between black women and everyone else!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot racist. Better grammar.\n\nGood looking out, Edith.\n\nThis week, News Editor Breanna Edwards rankled a legion of white people when she wrote an article about the sentient colostomy bag who smeared her bodily fluids all over her roommate\u2019s belongings and got off Scott-free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI honestly can\u2019t explain why they were upset ... they just were. They weren\u2019t just mad ... they were big mad. Take this comment, for example:\n\nFrom: LT1990\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Dont even have to read the article to know that it is written by a racist bitch. Just because that nasty bitch got off with little more than a warning, it doesn\u2019t mean it had anything to do with her race. STOP RACE BAITING!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s kinda racist. You will notice that the only egregious error is the lack of an apostrophe in \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d But it gets worse:\n\nFrom: FUCKTHEOBAMAS\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Author is a RACIST. CUNT AND A SLAG.\n\nSee how\u2014as he or she upped the racism ante\u2014the number of capital letters increased? And what\u2019s with the random period?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to point out that, for black people, \u201ccunt\u201d is not really a thing. I understand that it\u2019s one of the worst white insults, ranking second only to \u201cwhite people.\u201d Also, what is a slag? I\u2019m sure I could look it up, but I don\u2019t know if I want to know.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think I want that in my Google search history.\n\nHere\u2019s another one:\n\nFrom: SNOWFLAKE\n\nTo: Breanna Edwards Just goes to show you your BL DON\u2019T MATTER any more than anyone elses. Your still 2nd class. Better yet NO CLASS THATS WHY YOU LIVE IN GHETTOS ITS WERE YOU BELONG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCase closed.\n\nAnd finally, this series of comments on the article about cultural appropriation and Bruno Mars:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: borgohugis\n\nTo: Michael Harriot One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it. It\u2019s demeaning when money is made from Black music but doesn\u2019t go to Black people. It\u2019s demeaning when Black music is used to gain influence and power to a person that is not Black. It\u2019s making fun of Black people when a non-Black person pretends and is a mockery of Black music, dance and culture. It diminishes the Black legacy because Black artists aren\u2019t getting awards for the Black music they create. This deprives us of historical records and credit. Michael, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but a pattern is emerging. A black woman broke this shit down and you said \u201cnope\u201d. When Mo\u2019Nique broke the shit down, you said \u201cnope\u201d. Why is your response \u201cnope\u201d when your argument is as weak as \u201cOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars\u201d. Wut?? You see fit to use your aunties as proof of Blackness but you are never here supporting the words of Black women. This shit is fucked up and you need to start thinking about what and who you are trying to support. If it isn\u2019t the words of Black women then I don\u2019t even know why you see fit to write anything especially something as weak as this. Bills must be paid and clicks must be had but damn do you really have to do it at the expense of Black women who are speaking truth?\n\nFrom: Kalx\n\nTo: borgohugis Thank you for saying this. I\u2019ve been noticing that I disagree with Michael\u2019s takes 87% of the time. It\u2019s mind numbing at this point. He\u2019s a lot like Charlemagne the Charlatan.\n\nFrom: borgohugis To: Kalx When he round about defended Charlemagne was egregious enough. Also the writing is so weak. He tries to wrap up the header in the last paragraph with the flimsiest reason after spending half the article giving evidence that goes against his argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest borgohugis and Kalx,\n\nI could tell you that I am the least sexist person I know and that I don\u2019t see gender. I could easily dismiss your criticism by saying that some of my best friends are black women (actually, just three; but three count as \u201csome,\u201d right?).\n\nInstead of rejecting your comments out of hand, I did what I wish some white readers would do. I examined myself and what you call \u201ca pattern\u201d that is emerging in my work. I didn\u2019t just examine myself; I examined my content. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nIn 2018, I have written 148 stories for The Root. Twenty-five of those stories were about, or had something to do with, black women. Here is the list of black women I said \u201cnope\u201d to:\n\nSeren Sensai: Although I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation.\n\n\n\nAlthough I disagree with you on characterizing what I said as \u201cnope.\u201d I specifically said she \u201cmakes a convincing argument breaking down why Mars is a derivative artist,\u201d and that \u201cEvery single word Sensei said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\u201d If you disagree on my interpretation, that is fine, but you should know that this article was sparked by my hearing the argument from men and women about cultural appropriation. Omarosa Manigault Newman: I admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nI admit that I wholeheartedly disagree with almost everything she does. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Priyanka Banks : A reality-TV star actress who sued her sorority for kicking her out of Delta Sigma Theta.\n\nA reality-TV actress who sued her sorority for kicking her out of Delta Sigma Theta. Karima Garner: A black woman whose actions I vehemently disagreed with ... only because she killed another woman by injecting her booty with Home Depot silicone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the list.\n\nNotice that list does not include Mo\u2019Nique because when the \u201cboycott Netflix\u201d debate emerged, I was one of the first writers not only to defend her position but also to attempt to dissect it using the history and economics of Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the article you pointed out, I concluded:\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable. Mo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t object to your characterization of my argument, even if you feel like I sided with \u201cCharlemagne the Charlatan\u201d or didn\u2019t castigate him enough. Maybe I didn\u2019t write it well enough or left it open to interpretation. Perhaps I was too evenhanded. I can accept that. I find it interesting that you think I dismissed Mo\u2019Nique while other readers thought I sided with Mo\u2019Nique too much.\n\nIn fact, one particular reader disliked my initial commentary so much that he called to explain his viewpoint as soon as the article appeared. I can\u2019t reveal our conversation, but let\u2019s just say he is a high-ranking executive for a company that rhymes with \u201cMetflix.\u201d\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t dismiss your criticism. If either of you feels that I am dismissive of black women or that I am wrong 87 percent of the time, I invite you to skip my byline. I can\u2019t imagine reading someone whose writing was \u201cso weak\u201d and was so wrong so often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is my job to examine and critique race and culture. I try not to be too thin-skinned to accept the backlash or to ignore those who are critical of me. But Kalyx and borgohugis, I must admit that your comments made me rethink a lot of my prejudices for one reason:\n\nYour grammar was impeccable.", "keywords": ["solved", "didnt", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "article", "dont", "person", "think", "mailbag", "black", "better"], "polarity": 0.03708051930708181, "subjectivity": 0.49681022102897116},

I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people.

Your words affect me in no way, and there is a very good reason why:\n\nEven though I think the fragility of Caucasians and their unwillingness to dismantle or accept their part in creating and upholding a worldwide system of evil, oppression and hate is hilarious, it is not overwhelming.

While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["feel", "secondhand", "racist", "michael", "writing", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "im", "article", "dont", "clapbacks", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis. But Obama\u2019s simple existence pulled down America\u2019s pants and exposed its flaccid inferiority complex to the world.\n\nBut Joe, it\u2019s not your fault that you were born that way. And it\u2019s not Obama\u2019s fault that America is this way.\n\nAlso, sorry about your penis.\n\nI blame Obama.\n\nFrom: Dominic\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: How did you get on my mobile Please remove your dumb ass news source from my phone immediately.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["racist", "clapback", "obama", "roots", "blame", "white", "know", "mike", "way", "dont", "world", "mailbag", "mama", "black", "race"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

But because of my dedication to the readers of The Root, I crawled out of bed to respond to a few emails, tweets, comments and direct messages we receive during the week. (And because, when I told my editor, Yesha Callahan, about my sickness, she sympathetically said, \u201cSooo ... you gonna do the mailbag or nah?\u201d)\n\nIf the flu kills me and I die at this keyboard, know that I made this sacrifice for you. Tell my grandchildren about how I used to clap back. Avenge my death!

Remember I loved you all!*\n\n* (Unless Yesha\u2019s reading this.)\n\nThis first item is meant to address one of the most frequent complaints received by The Root. I have been emailed by numerous white women arguing the same point, which is the most white-womanish point ever:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom L. Greenbow\n\nSubject: Your hate for white women I am numb to your treatment of white women because you want to throw stones at them so much that people don\u2019t pay attention to it anymore. What bothers me it when you keep pushing the narrative that 53% of white women voted for Trump. That is not the case. 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. Most white women did not vote for him because only a small porecetage one the population votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is another comment from a reader named \u201cGet some Dak Sausage,\u201d who posted about it multiple times in a post that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, white women or even politics. They complained about Senior Editor Stephen Crockett\u2019s use of the stat in several comments:\n\nYes. I\u2019m saying that factually roughly 25% of white women voted for Trump. That\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m not talking about how complicit everyone feels the roughly half of white women that didn\u2019t vote are.\n\nDear L and Get:\n\nI apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. When I wrote that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, I made a mistake. In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck.

You have the title.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this to others before, but you get the championship trophy as the most racist white person ever. I\u2019ve seen hate before, but ... damn.

THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET.

BUT THUS FAR ONLY THE WHITE COUNTRIES ARE GENEROUS AND KNOW THE WAY OF GIVE NOT GET.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Adolph Crackerjack\n\nSubject: The difference between white men and everyone else White men live their lives. They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal.

If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["whites", "say", "men", "clapback", "horribles", "roots", "know", "white", "women", "im", "trump", "mailbag", "voted", "black", "basket"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

I was entertained by your writing and found myself laughing out loud a few times. I genuinely like your style of writing and will continue to read your pieces. But, as I read further into this piece I found myself getting more and more confused by your message. There was some obvious hate directed towards white people. I am a \u201cChad.\u201d I\u2019m about as Chad as they get. Like you, a Jamal, I had only one friend who was not like me. My one black friend, Tim, was the only black kid in our school. I can vividly recall the first time I knew he was different. It\u2019s when my Dad saw him and asked if there were other black kids at my school. That one question changed everything. It made me aware that Tim was supposedly different. Parents teach their kids when they don\u2019t even know it. As someone who considers themselves not racist, I teach my kids how to not be racist, prejudice, or an asshole by not acknowledging the difference in someone who is not white, heterosexual, or different in any way. If I were to point out their differences, it would be, at the very least, condescending. And I\u2019d be doing the same thing my Dad did to me, perpetuating prejudice. Its very frustrating to read about a generalization about white people and how they feel about black people. Why can\u2019t I read your column and just be entertained? Why do I have be lumped into a small group of people or made to feel ashamed or embarrassed to be white? I hate being hated for no reason. I realize that is exactly how you must feel. And that is how you very subtlely came accross. I\u2019m aware enough to know I\u2019m missing something. I\u2019m interested in hearing your take on this because I feel like you can honestly enlighten me as to why you feel the way you do about white people. And why you feel it\u2019s okay to generalize and lump us altogether. I challenge you to respond without bringing up what our shitty forefather\u2019s did, what previous generations did, or what you\u2019ve been told to believe. I want to hear what you have personally seen and experienced that makes you so comfortable in perpetuating prejudices. Thanks, Greg\n\nDearest Greg:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely let you know that I am sorry that you are ashamed or embarrassed about your race. Unlike you, I honestly believe it\u2019s OK to be white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a \u201cJamaal\u201d (you spelled it wrong, but that\u2019s OK), I also want to congratulate you for having one black friend way back in elementary school. On behalf of our entire Jamaal population, I offer our collective thanks for your charitable willingness to befriend someone who is black and to be so accepting of diversity that you remember the one black guy you rescued from the wild so many years ago. It moves me to tears every time I hear a heartwarming story like yours about how you were willing to adopt a Jamaal during your youth.\n\nAs for your challenge for me to respond without bringing up something your shitty forefathers did (again, you spelled it wrong; there was no need for that random apostrophe), I need some clarification on the matter.\n\nWould your dad be considered a \u201cforefather\u201d when he pointed out the race of your pet Tim? Because if parents teach their kids without even knowing it, as you claim, then it is obvious that yours taught you well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is what I am trying to get at, Greg/Chad.\n\nYou cannot write me letters insinuating that I perpetuate racism against white people that permeates society and infects future generations while simultaneously asking why I am lumping you in with the fucked-up people who came before you. If one Jamaal like me can somehow make black people hate white people, then imagine the effect of an entire nation of Jamaals.\n\nImagine if, instead of writing on the internet, we Jamaals did this for the next four centuries: passing our hate down to our children. Imagine if we had Jamaal-only neighborhoods and caged the Chads into certain areas with underfunded schools and endemic poverty. Imagine if we threw job applications into the trash if they had the name Chad or Becky on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only that, but what if every person named Jamaal benefited from the simple happenstance that they were named Jamaal? What if anyone named Jamaal could live anywhere they wanted, do whatever they wished and didn\u2019t have to worry about the random pitfalls of society because their name provided them immunity and privilege?\n\n\n\nAnd then one day, one of them overheard someone named Tim ...\n\nOr Chad ...\n\nOr Michael Harriot, telling people about the Jamaals.\n\nAnd after benefiting from being named Jamaal for a quadruple century, Jamaal sat down at his desk and typed a letter explaining how he lived in such privileged isolation from everyone else that he remembered the exact motherfucking day, time and year when he first encountered one of those poor, non-Jamaal savages, and took it in like a pet hamster, finally realizing that he lived in a Jamaal-based society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, if you will, after all of that, this douchebag had stored up so much entitlement that he had the Jamaal-dacity to say to someone ... anyone:\n\n\u201cI heard what you said and I\u2019m offended. Now explain why you feel like that without mentioning anyone named Jamaal.\u201d\n\nJamaal, please.\n\nThis next letter is regarding the little girl who saw former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait and thought she was a queen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: j40oaks\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Oh .... Goof Grief! Oh ...... good grief....... the little girl looking at the so called portrait of Michelle Obutthole was just trying to figure out who the hell it was ....as the portrait looks NOTHING like Michelle Obutthole! Give us a break.... will you???? We are tired of hearing about the Obuttholes. ... worst damn administration to EVER darken the door of the Whitehouse. Really, Toots, you little millennial cupcakes are the scurge upon this great country! TRY TO GROW THE HELL UP!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nj40oaks:\n\nFirst, I want to congratulate you on becoming the first person to have a repeat appearance in the mailbag. Also, your previous letter calling staff writer Monique Judge \u201cone of the most racist bitches to ever breath [sic]\u201d was in all capital letters. Your embrace of lowercase letters shows growth (we\u2019re still working on the ellipses, but that\u2019s a lesson you learn in sixth-grade grammar; you\u2019ll get there), but what I\u2019d like to know is:\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nWho hurt you, j40? Did a black guy steal your college sweetheart? Were you cut from your middle school basketball team and replaced by a Negro with a superior vertical leap?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI want to applaud you for your candor, and for the fact that you embrace your racism. The majority of our hate mail includes the caveat \u201cI\u2019m not racist,\u201d but not yours, j40. I appreciate the fact that despite your obviously low IQ, your inability to dribble and being saddled with the gut-wrenching memory of watching Amber pose for prom pictures with DeMarcus, you know who you are: an unapologetic bigot.\n\nI recognize your hate for Michelle Obama. I know she didn\u2019t sign a single piece of legislation, have any role in governing or affect your life in any measurable way. I understand that it is her blackness that offends you (what else could it be?). The fact that a little girl could admire someone black must really eat away at your nerves.\n\nI have instructed Anne to stop destroying our country with this bullshit because\u2014even though the \u201cmillennial cupcakes\u201d appreciate positive stories\u2014I see now that you can\u2019t handle it. She will do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, about ... something:\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nFrom: David\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Repent Michael you are a person of the baser sort who is so full of hatred and ungodliness that you cannot even think clearly. Your articles are so vile and disgusting and you are so full of yourself that you cannot even have any other thoughts than the ones you deceive yourself into thinking you are always right. You will have your judgement day and, as you kneel before the Lord Jesus Christ on that day, you will realize how foolish you were. It is not to late to repent, but I think you will only mock me and what I have written to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I thanked him for his letter, he wrote back:\n\nI got to you I see and I am glad. You need to repent Michael and all those Lily white liberals who are falling all over themselves to praise you also need to repent. You have a lot of people who are so in love with you or else they feel so guilty about their deep seated prejudices towards black people that they are so afraid of offending you else they fear they may be found our. It is sickening to read all of these fawners and you eat it up with a spoon. I speak truth to you Michael and I am no bigot. I have lived around all kinds of people all if my life and I can spot a phony when I see one, of which you are. You have deep seated hatred in your heart for white folks and you don\u2019t sound as though you really know any. You disparage President Trump without even knowing what he is trying to do, and yet you give a pass to the last one who was in office and did nothing good for the black Americans who live in the inner cities. Eight years and he only did terrible corrupt things. He was more concerned about men being able to go into girls bathrooms. Ask the black Americans who live in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore and other inner cities and ask them what he did for them. Nothing at all. Bring in anyone from any country and support them, but turn your back on our citizens. That is what he did. Hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson he loves. Also terrorists are his friends, but not Americans. Our new president is trying to put Americans first, or can\u2019t you see that Michael? You need to seek the truth because the truth is the only thing that will set you free. Jesus said that.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease allow me to pray with you.\n\n\n\nDear White Jesus:\n\nI come to you, Lord, not only on my behalf, but on behalf of all my people who don\u2019t know how President Trump is saving this country. We ask you right now for your forgiveness, Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive us for offending David, precious Caucasian savior. I know you said \u201cthe truth will set you free,\u201d which is why we are probably in this predicament right now, untanned Father. But now I finally see the light of your brave prophets, like David, who are out here fighting the good fight, alabaster Jesus. I trust him when he says he\u2019s \u201cno bigot,\u201d because I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something in your word about trusting motherfuckers who say they\u2019re not racist, precious lamb. I know it probably doesn\u2019t say \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d my Lord, and I know there\u2019s something about false prophets, but Imma ride with the \u201cno bigot\u201d thing for the rest of this prayer, Jesus.\n\nYour Highness, I thank you for saving me from choking when he talked about how great Trump is and said Barack Obama did \u201cterrible and corrupt things.\u201d\n\nLord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to erase the notion that almost every time someone says they\u2019re not racist, then brings up Chicago, Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and transgender bathrooms, they always turn out to be racist, Lord. But not David, sweet Jesus. He is your servant! He has shown me the love of Jesus, precious Father!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, I pray.\n\nAmen\n\nAnd for our positive mail, I will give you a few pieces of mail I have featuring one recurring theme that we often receive: suggestions for names to call white people:\n\nFrom: Milkshakedave\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Two things: Dear Mr. Harriot, In your March 2 Clapback Mailbag, I read the following: \u201c...they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\u201d Your assertion has been the only one I\u2019ve read that has come remotely close to explaining what I\u2019ve felt for the last couple of years is at the centre of the Trumpling mindset. (As an aside, I\u2019m very disappointed my \u2018Trumpling\u2019 insult/nickname hasn\u2019t stuck. Rhymes with \u2018dumpling\u2019. The boiled ball of dough served in gravy? Works on so many levels. Maybe it\u2019s not a thing in US cuisine.) This attitude that you expressed and I maintain is found all too frequently in domestic violence where the jilted ex pursues a murder-suicide solution by thinking \u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one can\u201d. In this case, the Trumplings as a collective, who because they feel threatened not being able to adapt to and cannot see themselves in a changed America, are saying: \u201cIf I can\u2019t have my America, then no one can\u201d... For what reason do Trumplings turn a blind eye to the innumerable contradictions, lies, and hypocrisy; to the unethical, unprincipled, and unlawful behaviour of Trump and the Republicans when the slightest whiff of such under Obama would have brought apoplectic screeches of outrage? Because, as you know, they do not want America to be for anyone other than themselves.\n\nFrom: Fakey McFake\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: none Hello, Mr. Harriot. I enjoy your writing on the Root. I had a stray thought that I share with you, only half jokingly. I do not feel there is an injurious-enough slur for white people. I am white. When I hear \u201chonky\u201d or \u201ccracker,\u201d I feel no insult. I do not care what a \u201chonky\u201d is, and \u201ccracker\u201d is just funny. However, if someone were to call me a \u201cTrump,\u201d I would lose my mind and turn red with anger. Perhaps one could start a campaign to install \u201cTrump\u201d as the worst possible slur one use for a white person, so that the name of this piece of human garbage will live infamy. Kind of like what the gay community did with Rick Santorum. This is probably a weird, terrible, divisive idea. In any case, keep up the great work. Don\u2019t ever call me a Trump.

This week\u2019s roundup of emails, comments, tweets and direct messages comes from white people who aren\u2019t racist; they just want the writers at The Root to stick to facts.\n\nFor insight, we collected a few of the people who set aside their disdain for our obvious lack of intelligence so that they could educate us on the truth. We wanted to highlight these unseen contributors as a way of thanking them for their continued support. Without you, where would we be?\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail.\n\nOur first set of correspondence doesn\u2019t relate to any particular post. In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "white", "racism", "crime", "lincoln", "facts", "mailbag", "black", "stop"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

You cause nothing but more racial division. You all make many Americans fucking sick to their stomachs, and we wish you\u2019d crash and burn. You\u2019re the fucking racist fascists.\n\nName Zachary A.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject Black Panther post Message I\u2019m not sure why you wrote this, but the reluctancy should have kept, because you sound like a racist idiot. I\u2019m not sure that your rant was much better than Ben Shapiro\u2019s, because you both spew shit from your cloudy and skewed perspectives. Also Gal Gadot is not \u201cBrazilian or something\u201d, that\u2019s a derogatory thing to say and shows your true ignorance. So fuck you, and I hope your writing career ends soon. (not that you have any real articles anyway)\n\nFrom: Jason\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Plea I came across your \u201copen letter\u201d via my Google feed. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time. Michael\n\nBut of all the people who were angry, the people who believed the letter was addressed directly to them were the funniest:\n\nFrom: Tina To: Michael Don\u2019t lump. me in with white people. I have common sense. I don\u2019t lump all people of color based on lack of common Sense of the few. Famous or vocal does not equal common sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the coup de grace:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: I\u2019m NOT THE RACIST. SEEMS YOU ARE Slept w& fell in love w/an African American and had a child. Did I give up on that child cause at that particular time, 30,some ought years ago that was not so very much liked? I lived &STILL live in that same neighborhood. Yes, it\u2019s a weathly neighborhood, buy I could care less about that. Thankfully, most of those people who said that to ME about MY child, have now passed on. R.I.P TO THEM CAUSE THEY\u2019LL NEED IT WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER JESUS CHRIST. U HAVE TO GO THROUGH JESUS CHRIST TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. BET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW THAT, DID YOU? I know for a fact that I and my now HANDSOME WEALTHY WHITE HUSBAND are NOT RACIST. VERY FAR FROM IT. FROM WHAT I read in that 1 article,that just popped up on my phone, I simply found YOU JUST HATING WHITE PEOPLE. The white people I & My husband know are SO FAR AWAY FROM BEING RACIST, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN LAUGHABLE. But for YOU to call ME a RACIST IS SO BEYOND FUNNY, IT\u2019S NOT EVEN FUNNY. Unfortunately, by YOU CALLING ME A RACIST, MAKES YOU ONE. If you really want to GO FOR it, DO YOU GET TO HANG OUT WITH THE ROLLING STONES? BET YOU DON\u2019T. AND YES,MY HUSBAND &I HAVE BEEN ON THEIR PRIVATE JET. I HAVE LITERAL PICTURES. Darryl Jones is one of the most kind gentlemen I\u2019ve ever met. I care 4u cause I feel so sad for you. I\u2019ll bet money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST? Right? Yes,and my husband and I are the HOLLOWAYS. AND YES WE DO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, CAUSE IT\u2019S THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO HIS FATHER, GOD. WHAT\u2019S GOING TO COME OUT YOUR RACIST MOUTH NOW? I can only wonder? THE HOLLOWAYS.....And YES I\u2019ll bet I have MORE money than you do. NOT that it matters, but I\u2019ll bet IT does to YOU? Right?Again.....The HOLLOWAYS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I didn\u2019t answer, she wrote back:\n\nFrom: Starlene\n\nTo: Michael harriot\n\nSubject: I just reported you for calling me A RACIST. NO ONE CALLS ME A RACIST! I Will bet you money that you do not believe in JESUS CHRIST. I can practically guarantee you know nothing about JESUS CHRIST/GOD.Do u know how to get into HEAVEN?I guarantee you do not. I will pray for you,cause I already feel & know YOU need help extremely badly. I already know that you will not send me back a comment. Right? Mrs.HOLLOWAY. AND how DARE you call the HOLLOWAYS -BITCH? We ARE a Famous family that you will NEVER hear of. We are quite people. PERIOD.\n\nOK, guys, as one of the world\u2019s foremost reverse racists, I would never diminish your pain. Although I would chop off my left pinky toe for the privilege of scanning the landscape of everything that offends me and black people and deciding that the biggest act of racism is an article about a movie about a fictional character in a fictional country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nBut I\u2019ll be honest with you guys: I\u2019m not tired of you. Your words affect me in no way, and there is a very good reason why:\n\nEven though I think the fragility of Caucasians and their unwillingness to dismantle or accept their part in creating and upholding a worldwide system of evil, oppression and hate is hilarious, it is not overwhelming. The Root receives far more positive correspondences from people\u2014both black and white\u2014who appreciate the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you that I will not be clapping back this week. Instead, I have outsourced this week\u2019s clapback to these three individuals:\n\nFrom: Susie\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thank You Michael, I just want to send my thanks to you because I have learned so much by reading your articles. I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["feel", "secondhand", "racist", "michael", "writing", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "im", "article", "dont", "clapbacks", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

Monique Judge for the record, Black Men have consistently explained the Gay Agenda, and if you like we can have a discussion about it. You and the other coon, Michael Harriot at root.com need to fall back from attacking Confident heterosexual Black Men. Before you call me a Hotep, save it for the person that fit the description. I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner.

How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women. She ended this discussion with a quote by Audre Lorde:\n\n", "keywords": ["sparked", "say", "poor", "fought", "favela", "suffer", "women", "marielle", "franco", "murder", "rio", "politician", "death", "woman", "black", "protests", "killed", "brazil"], "polarity": 0.031206597222222222, "subjectivity": 0.406125992063492},

You act like every white man hates every black man. Let me tell you something, you don\u2019t understand how not all white people are racist, just like not all germs are harmful or bad for you. So do you want to give me a better explanation about how Obama improved race relations than me just sitting through an article about uninformed statements about white people waving confederate flags and whispering racist jokes? Joe\n\nLike you, I also believe that former President Barack Obama ruined race relations in America. I have a theory that I like to call the \u201cObama effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween my sophomore and junior years in college, I had a job at a paper factory. I was the only black guy in the department where these huge paper tubes were made. I didn\u2019t know shit about paper or pulp, but I have always been pretty swift when it comes to figuring shit out.\n\nThe white guys, who had been working in the plant for years, saw me as an interloper and privileged dude who had never worked a hard job in his life. They even nicknamed me \u201cWorm\u201d because I was so skinny that my knees buckled the first time I had to lift one of those tubes.\n\nBut after a while, they also noticed that whenever there was a problem, I could help solve it pretty quickly. Soon they made me a \u201crover\u201d\u2014someone who basically wandered around the floor and helped fix shit. Whenever anything went wrong, they would call for \u201cthe Worm.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept for one guy.\n\nOne guy couldn\u2019t stand to ask for help from me. I suspect it was because he was so racist that he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that a black guy could figure out a problem that he couldn\u2019t. He would ask anyone for help except me, but they would always tell him to \u201cask Worm.\u201d This motherfucker was so resistant that he started losing his production bonus rather than ask me for help. He would rather be broke.\n\nThat\u2019s the Obama effect.\n\nI believe that much of the hate Obama received had nothing to do with politics. It was because these people had never had a black guy telling them what to do, and despite the fact that he fixed the economy, killed America\u2019s greatest enemy and gave millions of Americans health care, they would rather fuck up themselves and the country than admit that he was a decent president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Obama ruined race relations. For white people like you, Joe, racism was this country\u2019s secret shame, like a man with a small penis. But Obama\u2019s simple existence pulled down America\u2019s pants and exposed its flaccid inferiority complex to the world.\n\nBut Joe, it\u2019s not your fault that you were born that way.

Your hatrid for whites exudes from every pore. It is quite entertaining to watch, but I feel embarassed for you mostly. You are clearly a sociopath with narcisstic tendencies that thinks the entire world evolves around the struggles of the American black person. Are you struggling Mike? Really? You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. But you like to throw around those old tired words such as inequality, oppressed and racist. Yawn. There are people in today\u2019s world and historically that truly experienced those things, but not you Mike. You don\u2019t know struggle Mike. The reason you will never attain any respect or credibility is because you only think that you exist. Your selfish and self centered behavior refuses to allow you to notice the hundreds of other races in the world besides your own Mike. But you cannot see it and probably do not care. So, don\u2019t ask yourself why I don\u2019t care it either. You remind me of the person that Booker T. Washington was describing when he said: \u201cThere is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs \u2014 partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.\u201d This is you Mike. You make a living off of preaching hate and fueling the fire of division. Without it, you would be forced to find a new source of income, therefore, you choose to maximize the opportunity. Without this you offer nothing to the world. Is that what scares you Mike? All the skills you posses is being a race baiter? Come on man. You are better than that right? Get over yourself Mike. You will never win until you get out of the hole you have decided to live in. There are more races than just black and white Mike. You may want to pull your head out of your rear and notice how the hispanic race is blowing by you ever so quietly with wrecklace abandon, while you whine and complain. Best, Jorge\n\nWhen Jorge received no reply, he sent another message:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Jorge\n\nSubject: Hi Mike\n\n\n\nSILENCE...exactly.\n\nAnd this Twitter DM came from Brent:\n\nFrom: Brent Hello, I read one of your stories today and loved the way you over exaggerated it to make the readers feel your hatred. Yes some white people are definitely messed up and horribly racist but the only way the world will change for the better is to stop trying to create sides. I\u2019ve seen messed up stories made up by both sides. Don\u2019t be that guy. Your better then that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Jorge and Brent:\n\nI would like to fill you in on how I came to hate the whites:\n\nIt has been mentioned a few times in the comments sections that I was homeschooled until the age of 11. I was raised by a mother who was a combination of flower power hippie and Black Panther (not the T\u2019Challa one; the other kind). I lived in a black neighborhood. I had black friends. Although she taught me a lot about black people through osmosis and the huge collection of books in our home (I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X at age 7, and after reading the science fiction novel Soul of the Robot, I figured that Eldridge Cleaver\u2019s Soul on Ice couldn\u2019t be much different), she never really talked about white people at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I finally went to public school, I was supposed to be placed in the fifth grade but was skipped to the seventh. For the rest of my academic career, I was surrounded by white kids.\n\nAlthough white supremacy is inescapable in America, unlike most people, I had never spent any significant time around the whites. I was a black person who had never held any reverence, fear or respect for white people. Even after joining them in a scholastic setting, from high school through college, I never really met any white people who were especially smart or gifted. Being raised in a Caucasian-free bubble allowed me to view white people objectively, even more so than an immigrant would.\n\nBecause of this, I had many white friends, many of whom I am still close to. In fact, I\u2019d probably say I have more white friends than the average black person. Some of them are probably reading this right now. Almost all of them will tell you that I sometimes speak about race, politics and our differences without a filter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI say all of that to say this:\n\nWhen you read some of the things that I write, I know that my commentary often comes off as angry or belligerent, and I even understand why it seems that way:\n\nWhite people aren\u2019t used to anyone talking to them that way.\n\nMost people fashion conversations about anything in such a manner that they will be effective at changing the person\u2019s mind and get him or her to understand their viewpoint. As such, most conversations about race are tailored to appease white sensibilities. In a land built and sustained by white supremacy, the default setting is to discuss race in a way that caters to the sensibilities of the majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately\u2014or, in your case, unfortunately\u2014my upbringing was not entrenched in that way of thinking. I do not hate white people. I am simply unencumbered by the need to sidestep their sensibilities to make my point. White people are not my enemy. White people are not my friends. White people are not special to me. They are just people.\n\nSo when I write in this unapologetic, unfiltered way, it often offends the whites because they are not accustomed to being spoken to in such a manner. Because most of them are used to people\u2014especially minorities\u2014tiptoeing around their sensitivities to make a point, they interpret truth as anger.\n\nThat is white privilege.\n\nYes, I write about race. It\u2019s my job. Aside from that, I don\u2019t really think about white people that much. Sorry to burst your bubble, but I am not obsessed with race, any more than a carpenter is obsessed with wood. If you\u2019d like to believe that I walk around with a chip on my shoulder looking for ways to be offended by racism, I apologize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJorge, I enjoyed your quote from Booker T. Washington. For most of his career, he was at odds with W.E.B. Du Bois on how they viewed America\u2019s race problem. Du Bois said of Washington, regarding the passage that you previously quoted:\n\nHis doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro\u2019s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nIn all of your diatribe, you neglected to point out that racism does exist. If, by chance, it disappeared from the face of the earth, I would be happy to lose my job. I would even be delighted if racism withered away to a microscopic speck of bigotry undetectable to the human eye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hypothetical, tiny little bit of bigotry is also the size of the fuck I give about what you think of me.\n\nI get it from my mama.\n\nBe well.\n\nAnd finally, as promised, a bit of positive mail to end this week\u2019s mailbag:", "keywords": ["racist", "clapback", "obama", "roots", "blame", "white", "know", "mike", "way", "dont", "world", "mailbag", "mama", "black", "race"], "polarity": 0.04071927915148254, "subjectivity": 0.4846882464679076},

Reads like a joke from The Onion. All written on white man\u2019s technology, while you\u2019re safe under the roof designed by white men, built by white men, and you crawl back to your sad little existence, carrying that sad little excuse for a paycheck, signed by a white man. You want to experience all of the wonders and technology of a culture who\u2019s biggest contribution to the world was using their own as cattle? Knock yourself out, boy. I hear Liberia is LOVELY this time of year. What better place to enjoy the hard work and innovation of black people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, from Midland:\n\n\u201cMansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.\u201d As long as you are incapable of seeing great civilisations except by how they compare to Europe, you are still caught in the eurocentric trap. Also as you are not European, that is not self deprecation on your part, but weirdly aggressive xenophobia. If a European boastfully remarked at how much of a shithole xy or z non-European country was compared to a contemporary European country, you would rightfully note that person to be an idiot, so why do you ruin a very informative article by boorishly doing the same? \u201cInstead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation\u201d Because the violent conquering had already taken place and annexation is not a peaceful act anyway. Why do you feel the need to sanitise a powerful empire? Imperialism is not universally bad in all situations, it has been the human way for millenia. \u201cWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali.\u201d You sound almost gleeful. Western Europe also had universities, grand cathedrals and great market centres at this time. One of the reasons famine broke out was because countries like England had boomed since 1200 and by 1300 had a population estimated at between 5-6 million with more land cultivated than even in 1900. The Mali Empire\u2019s achievements at that time were clearly superior, but there is no need to denigrate other civilisations in a typically American fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow clap.\n\nJust when I thought I\u2019d seen the complete spectrum of white fragility, you come up with an entirely new category. I can only applaud your brilliance at the creative ways you find to be butt-hurt. To find a way to be offended about 14th-century historical facts is trailblazing. I honor you, sirs.\n\nI love when anyone, including Rev, refers to anything as \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d because it is indicative of the overarching intercontinental Caucasian pillaging mindset that has weaved its way through history. You motherfuckers will colonize anything! This may be presumptuous of me, but I\u2019m willing to bet all the money in my white man\u2019s paycheck that\u2014aside from his method of associating himself with Steve Jobs\u2019 computers and Al Gore\u2019s internet\u2014Rev hasn\u2019t invented a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know what I\u2019m gonna do, Rev? I\u2019m going to concede your point. If I am using the white man\u2019s technology and you are a white man, I\u2019m going to allow you to share credit for it. Using the transitive property, I\u2019m also going to give you shared credit for all white things. So Rev is responsible for Taylor Swift songs, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rape of Africa, the presidency of Donald Trump and the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWhich leads me to Midland.\n\nMidland, if you feel that I disparaged European countries, I apologize. But as you can see, it\u2019s not my fault. I know you are probably somewhere wrapped in a blanket, quietly weeping at how I denigrated your ancestral home team, but now you see: I be using the white man\u2019s things sometimes. According to Rev, it\u2019s your fault. Why don\u2019t you people take responsibility for your actions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for my part in this, I am willing to share in some of the blame. I recognize that since my people invented math, science, astronomy and agriculture before your people came over to Africa to study, steal and use it for atomic bomb-making, genocide and ravaging the earth, I am partially responsible for your salty, fuckboy tears of sorrow.\n\nI apologize.\n\nThe two recent articles on Boyce Watkins stirred up a lot of controversy about a lot of things. Two things, in particular, made their way to the mailbag. The first is from some of Watkins\u2019 adherents:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past year, I have come to understand a valuable truth about myself and one of my greatest weaknesses. Some may even call it an obsession. It is this:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see anyone take advantage of black people.\n\nIt makes me genuinely upset, and sometimes in my furor, I attack people. When I berate white people for their participation in white supremacy, some of the people who age like buttermilk left in the back seat of a Buick on a summer day (see ... there I go again) believe that it means I hate all white people. When I call out preachers who use the Bible as a means of spreading white people\u2019s messaging while stuffing their pockets with black people\u2019s hard-earned money, some Jesus worshippers view it as an attack on Christianity.\n\nAnd, yes, when I impugn the characters of people like Umar Johnson and Boyce Watkins for using the plight of black people to enrich themselves by duping people who have fallen prey to their cult of personality, as well as to trade in homophobia, misogyny and transphobia, some see it as an attack on black people, Pan-Africanism and cultural knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am fine with that.\n\nI realize that some white people believe in whiteness like some Christians believe in their pastors, like some black people believe in anyone who feeds them a fetishized bullshit narrative. Those people have faith. I will never change their minds because they believe in the people, not the ideas.\n\nBut I won\u2019t stop trying.\n\nBecause\u2014even when they\u2019re black\u2014those people are using blackness as a way to target my people. Johnson and Watkins are no different from Creflo Dollar or the Democratic Party. They mean us no good. They just want power and money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the entire time I\u2019ve written for The Root, I have never had a white person tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t write. In fact, aside from the directive from my black editors that I couldn\u2019t call Ray Lewis a \u201ccoon\u201d that one time, I have never been told by anyone what I couldn\u2019t say at The Root. No, we are not black-owned. But we are operated and run by black people and use our platform for black people. But I\u2019m sure that when you\u2019re typing your comments on white-owned Facebook\u2019s platform, Mark Zuckerberg sends you a private message telling you what you can and can\u2019t say.\n\nSo while you think you are dissing me for calling out charlatans, con men and people who scream about white supremacy only because they want the opportunity to get rich and control women, gays and transgender people, I actually take it as a compliment.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nAnd, finally, Boyce Watkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore last week, I had never followed Boyce Watkins and was only marginally aware of him. It was members of the Black Business School who pointed out this story to The Root and gave us the specifics, which means that if he feels attacked, he should confront his own customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Watkins is upset with The Root. He is pretending to be upset because his stream of revenue has been threatened. Who else is he going to attack\u2014the white guy and Asian guy who called him a \u201ccharacter\u201d whom they use to sell \u201chope and emotion\u201d as a \u201creligion\u201d to black people? They\u2019re his business partners. They created and control the \u201ceducational product\u201d he sells. Except for the email where he called their comments \u201crude and culturally insensitive,\u201d he has not distanced himself from the guys who said publicly, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to educate them.\u201d He remains in bed with people who don\u2019t seem to give a fuck about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during this whole ordeal, I gave Watkins the benefit of the doubt, as did some of the members of his organization who spoke with us. We all believed that he was being duped, too. They figured that he probably had no idea that the medicine he was selling to black people was just a placebo. But now I think differently.\n\nDespite the fact that he has not disproven a single fact in the story and, in fact, confirmed them all, Watkins has defended himself by telling his people that he was not given the opportunity to speak on the record:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is this:\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 2, four days before this story went live, I sent Watkins an email inviting him to speak on the record. I sent a media request to Watkins\u2019 personal page. I sent him a message on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he has continued to publicly say that he was not contacted, despite the fact that we posted his company\u2019s entire email response to the article. When he made these public statements, the petty part of me posted screenshots of my attempts to contact him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly deleted them.\n\nWatkins might not be a con man. He might be serious about helping black people achieve financial freedom. Maybe he believes that working with men who don\u2019t care about black people is the only way he can achieve his goals. But there is one thing you can be sure of:\n\n\n\nBoyce Watkins is a liar.", "keywords": ["mans", "clapback", "roots", "white", "watkins", "fact", "rev", "im", "way", "dont", "mailbag", "apology", "black", "using"], "polarity": 0.02524870962370963, "subjectivity": 0.4430071086321085},

This week\u2019s roundup of emails, comments, tweets and direct messages comes from white people who aren\u2019t racist; they just want the writers at The Root to stick to facts.\n\nFor insight, we collected a few of the people who set aside their disdain for our obvious lack of intelligence so that they could educate us on the truth. We wanted to highlight these unseen contributors as a way of thanking them for their continued support. Without you, where would we be?\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail.\n\nOur first set of correspondence doesn\u2019t relate to any particular post. In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "white", "racism", "crime", "lincoln", "facts", "mailbag", "black", "stop"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

Your claims have been overlooked for too long. They make movies about make-believe stuff like Santa Claus, Bigfoot and Caucasians who can dance, but never took the time to address your fairy tale of reverse racism. Hell, they even made a TV show about the Great Pumpkin and a movie about a sexy rabbit, but nothing about racist writers! How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work.

White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "blacks", "white", "im", "root", "sure", "mailbag", "butthurt", "black", "ok", "wrote"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

The film has been applauded by black people across the world for touching on the complex relationships between Africans and African Americans, for serving up positive images of African culture for global audiences, and for providing a vehicle that allows black people throughout the world to showcase their heritage and their pride.\n\n\n\nAs a recent article from The Intercept explains, this influence has shown up in Brazil in the form of rolezinho pretoi, which roughly translates to \u201cblack stroll,\u201d in which large groups of Afro-Brazilians turn up together to walk about an area. The stroll has a recent history of being a form of protest in Brazil.\n\nIn the Intercept piece, one group of Afro-Brazilians coordinated a rolezinho to watch Black Panther at one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most exclusive high-end shopping malls, Leblon. As the writer notes, Leblon is couched in one of the most affluent areas in Brazil and is also a predominantly white space in a country where the majority of the population now identifies as black or mixed race.\n\nThis made the Black Panther screening as much a political act as a celebration.\n\nFrom The Intercept:\n\nOrganizers would start an event on Facebook and call for everyone to meet at a certain mall at a certain time. Young, mostly dark-skinned residents of the city\u2019s poor and working-class neighborhoods on the urban periphery would take a sometimes one- or two-hour train or bus ride to shopping centers in the bougiest enclaves and just go for a walkabout. In some cases, thousands showed up, much to the horror of Brazil\u2019s white elite, whose ever-present racial and class-based fears were palpable. Malls, including Shopping Leblon, closed down in anticipation of these protests. Others were broken up with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rolezinho for the global blockbuster, then, was a way to celebrate blackness in a highly visible way, to reclaim a highly segregated and exclusive space.\n\nReinaldo Junior, an actor who participated in a recent rolezinho, told The Intercept, \u201cWe wanted to occupy this space today to say, \u2018We are alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe almost never see any of our people in this kind of space. It\u2019s as though this space is only meant for white people,\u201d said Lucin\u00edo Janu\u00e1rio, another actor. \u201cSo when we have a film written by black man, with black actors and black producers, we felt it was our duty to occupy this space so we could serve as an example.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYgor Marinho, a 28-year-old student who participated in the recent rolezinho and watched Black Panther for the first time, said that the movie\u2019s black-majority cast filled him with pride.\n\n\u201cIt makes me want to win. It makes me want to fight. It makes me like myself more, like my own skin tone, like my kind of hair, like the shape of my nose, like the shape of my lips, like myself more,\u201d Marinho told The Intercept, \u201cbecause you start to see people who are like you, and you see how they carry themselves\u2014empowered, happy with themselves\u2014and you start to like yourself better.\u201d", "keywords": ["space", "start", "makes", "white", "shopping", "spaces", "occupy", "intercept", "panther", "inspires", "rolezinho", "recent", "brazilians", "black", "whitedominant"], "polarity": 0.11405685932001719, "subjectivity": 0.4190486316802105},

As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

I\u2019m extremely disappointed that you feel the need to perpetuate the racial divide in this country. Admittedly, I\u2019m a white man. Not a white man of privilege, but a whit man nonetheless. I am a descendant of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and managed to build a lineage if success. It wasn\u2019t immediate and it wasn\u2019t easy. It took generations. I grew up on the east coast in some of the most diverse neighborhoods our nation had at the time. I shared classrooms and meals with people of color. As an adult, my home has always been open to people\u2019s of any origin, race, faith and sexual orientation. My son is gay. I admit that we all have our biases and some in this country have faced prejudices that I never will. That said, I have now read much of your work and can come to only one conclusion.. shame on you. Your work will do NOTHING to bring us together as a people. You clearly embrace the division because it gives you a platform. You are obviously an educated and articulate man. Unfortunately, you have chosen to use those abilities to perpetuate the division you claim to abhor. It is my hope that you see that your writings are not unifying or constructive. You have a platform to drive change.. instead you choose to perpetuate stereotypes.\n\nFrom: Michael G\n\nTo: Michael H.\n\nSubject Open Letter to White People Dear Michael, I find myself writing today in response to your article. I have to say that as a white man I cannot begin to understand the struggles that people of color are still going through. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe that within every individual is the ability to change their circumstances. If someone lives in the inner city and needs to get away, they can. If gangs are part of the equation, again, move. No one said this would be easy or cheap, but for the sake of children, what price? The people keeping the minorities down are the politicians and their rich friends who put just enough money into local schools so they don\u2019t close, and also they do things like dump $$ into Black Lives Matter. They want minorities to stay down. Stay angry. It\u2019s a cash cow for them. I truly wish we could all get along. Black Panther is just another cash cow for more elitist old white guys who conceptualized, bankrolled, cast, wrote, and on ad nauseum. I apologize for the rant, but I don\u2019t think that all whites are cut from the same cloth. But, being angry is usually the beginning of a fight. Thank you for your time.

I am a white woman who does anti-racism work with adults and children (on a multi-racial team). I thought because I did this type of work for a living I was anti-racist and doing my part. Your writing has made me realize that I have so much further to go on my journey to be anti-racist. I have been reading your column for a year now and it has made me a better person. I think of your writing and you when I make that quick decision-Should I say something? Should I show up for that? Now, I always do. Sometimes I fumble through my words and get nervous and don\u2019t always make the point I meant to-but with your words ringing in my ears I never stay silent. As a way of saying thanks, I made a donation to the #BlackPantherChallenge in your honor. I wish I could do more. With gratitude Susie\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Nicholans\n\nTo: Daniele Belton\n\nSubject: Prolly Just another Chad ... But trying not to beHello Ms. Belton,I am writing you today because I have been finding myself on TheRoot.com more and more every day. While at first, I must admit that I felt as though there was a tone of reverse racism in the many articles I have read, especially from Damon Young, and Michael Harriot, I pushed through knowing that further information will conclude that I am simply another Chad who grew up color blind and not knowing I was sitting there oblivious to the atmosphere the black community as a whole is still feeling in this country. Growing up in Southern California through the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, racial tensions are nothing new to me, however, my naivety did have me thinking they had improved. Especially with the election of President Obama, and his rise to prominence being achieved not only through the black community striving to have their voices heard and their votes acknowledged, but also because of those of many other races and backgrounds getting woke by the increasingly obvious racism that has come into further light in recent years due to social media and the internet. Growing up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and a very different cultural environment, when I moved to a new place that was predominantly white, I was finally faced with white privilege, and the obliviousness that I had been so na\u00efve to in my pre-adolescent life. I looked around, and felt very suspicious of every person(read: white) I interacted with. Going back to my old neighborhood from time to time allowed me to take some of my newly learned whiteness with me and help me realize how ignorant I really had been. Yet I continued to do nothing. Nothing to further the voices I was familiar with in a new environment who had so very few. Nothing to bring to light to these people, those who are suffering just a few towns away. I believe this is called White Guilt. Hard to say though, I am white after all, and don\u2019t know all of the terms I would suspect I should know. Fast- forward 20 years, and I find myself living in New England. Rhode Island to be more specific. I am now a software engineer at a non-tech electronics distribution company, allotted with an ample amount of time on the internet. This is where I have had the privilege to find the articles on TheRoot. Being that I have never been so aware of how many people in this country are still such racist pieces of shit, TheRoot has provided me at least some solace that not everyone is like these ignorant, ass-backward, self-proclaiming colonizers who still cling to the idea that the Matflower and its ilk are the only semblance of reality that matters. Frankly, I am pretty sure 90% of these people I meet, outside of the city, have never had a real discussion with any person of color.One article in particular that truly got me thinking, and made me want to further make changes in my life regarding activism, and how to behave as a still not fully woke white dude, was Mr. Harriot\u2019s article from 8-14-17 after the events in Charlottesville titled, \u201cFor Black People Who Have to Deal With White People This Week\u201d. Not only did this article provide me with insight on what NOT to talk about, it also showed me that, just because I am naively color blind, it doesn\u2019t mean it is my place and duty as such to speak of these things. It informed me to just shut my fucking mouth and let my interactions with people of color regarding such a \u201cyuge\u201d topic, talk to me if THEY feel like it and not because I feel in my whiteness that they should talk to me about it because of my empathetic wanting to appear, well, empathetic. This article pointed me in a direction to re-read most of the articles I had read on TheRoot with a newfound vigor to understand, and dismiss my aforementioned view of \u201creverse racist undertones\u201d. Also, it allowed me to understand why I feel the ways I do when I go to other news sites, and read the so-called news about current events that are reported by other non-woke writers who are reporting as only they know how to do at this moment. It showed me a way to prevent my \u201cwhite noseyness\u201d from being my purpose, and figure out WHY I was so enthralled and intrigued to get the information further from those directly affected, and less from those who act as if they are speaking for them. These things mentioned are what allowed me to see even further beyond the reported racial undertones of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d, and how it is not just another MCU comic book movie, and see the words I have always had in my heart and soul personified on screen with some of the most beautiful, well written, and brilliantly portrayed films I have seen in a very long time. I look forward to the day I can show this movie to my children to hopefully help them build a world that exists, as T\u2019Challa so eloquently described in the film, as a place where \u201cmore connects us than separates us\u201d. I feel this goes even one step further than Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d, if only in its more universal presentation to a public that may or may not make the attempt to see \u201cGet Out\u201d. Which in itself is a tragedy as \u201cGet Out\u201d was amazing! All the way up to the end when every single person, who was paying attention, thought the cops pulling up at the end would inevitably result in the now completely demolished, Daniel Kaluuya, being arrested and not saved. Even writing this I get chills and shakes thinking about it and Black Panther. Both films had me in tears multiple times, and had me questioning what one Chad can do to make a difference without acting like another Susan who thinks they are beyond reproach only because they themselves are not \u201cracist\u201d. In conclusion Ms. Belton, I want to know what I can do to help. Beit joining my local black community in protest or purpose, or even using what I innately have as White Privilege to benefit the movement to end segregation and help others wake the fuck up! Thank you for this site, and hopefully for reading this as \u201cfrom a man who wants to further devote himself to change\u201d, and not just another Chad, Becky or Susan who doesn\u2019t realize I am speaking out of place. Sincerest Regards, Nick PS \u2013 to Mr. Young, I do not take offense, nor condemn anything I have read that you or anyone on TheRoot have written. I just want to make that clear since it may not be as apparent in my letter as it is to Mr. Harriot. Thank you.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, this, from Twitter:", "keywords": ["feel", "secondhand", "racist", "michael", "writing", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "im", "article", "dont", "clapbacks", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": 0.030450332311646174, "subjectivity": 0.47322082925185116},

It also gave us an outlet that wasn\u2019t limited to, \u201cCan you believe what this motherfucker just wrote me?\u201d But now that we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, I\u2019ve realized something:\n\nRacists aren\u2019t very original.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t mean to upset the hardworking racist community out there by disparaging their work ethic. I would, in no way, demean you by besmirching the sheer volume of work put in every day by the people whose hearts are filled with what I imagine to be terrible things like black jellybeans, the crotches of Donald Trump\u2019s post-golf tighty-whities and the rag used to clean Harvey Weinstein\u2019s house plant.\n\nThe problem is that along with being not very smart, racism gets boring after a while. It\u2019s not that I am no longer offended\u2014I never really get mad at people calling me \u201cnigger\u201d anonymously; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m no longer entertained. Maybe I have become numb to racism, and every form of it has now become banal. Maybe I\u2019m just jaded like an EMT who can scrape brains off the concrete after a car wreck while eating a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m calling for all you racists out there to inject some thought, originality or at least some common sense into your correspondence. If not, we run the risk of excluding you from the mailbag totally, and no one wants that. The only other solution is, maybe you guys will stop being racist and ...\n\nNah, that\u2019ll never work.\n\nOur first correspondence concerns an article about an Air Force sergeant who went on a racist rant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Gary\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Feedback. ..airforce sergeant under investigation for racist rant How in the hell is this racist? All she said was \u201cblack\u201d...last I checked, saying \u201cblack females \u201c is not a racial slur. Talking about getting over sensitive and over reacting. So unless you\u2019re kissing black people ass, you\u2019re a racist. Thats bullshit. I\u2019ve also ran into quite a few black people with attitude in my life,as have I ran into alot of white people with attitude. ..no difference. ..attitude is attitude. Race dont mean shit when it comes to attitude. But since shes not black...then shes a racist?? Pfft. Ok,then...good luck with that. How about Mr. Chi from SNL... he called Trump a \u201ccracker\u201d tell me, why in the hell is that NOT racist? Cracker IS a racial slur when referring to whites. How about all the blacks that call each other \u201cnigger\u201d...if black people say it, its NOT racist, but anyone else... they\u2019re racist. Fuckin double standard in this country is getting WAAAAAY out of hand. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Is it racist...or \u201ca term of endearment\u201d as Kanye West once said? Make up your minds. Either way...for a black person to call a white person \u201ccracker\u201d or \u201cwonderbread\u201d or any of the other slurs they use, thats racist and makes them fucking Hypocrites too. If we all truely want to end racism, we need to stop getting our pants in a bunch over every little thing that has the slightest possibility of being racist, as well as holding EVERYONE, regardless of race, to the SAME standards. Just an opinion Thank you for your time\n\nHey, Gary:\n\nThere\u2019s a thing you need to know about racism: I don\u2019t say this to be combative. I genuinely hope that you will share it with your friends at the rallies and cross burnings:\n\nNo one gives a fuck what your white ass thinks about racism.\n\nStop thinking you get to decide or have a voice in anything about the subject. White people thinking they get to define racism is the same thing as a person who is accused of sexual assault climbing on the witness stand and presenting this legal defense:\n\n\u201cBut it was just date rape, right? I mean ... she\u2019s given consent to other men, so why should she be so mad at what I did? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Gary, I know you\u2019re dumb, so I\u2019m going to explain to you how white supremacy works:\n\nThe woman in this particular article is an officer in the armed forces\u2014an organization that has a strict hierarchy. She also holds an innate prejudice against black women, as do many others. In her world, her feelings are so uncontroversial and widespread that she was comfortable enough to share them on the internet.\n\nI presume that the airwoman, as a member of the Air Force, will be promoted multiple times. She will undoubtedly have women of color under her command. Those women\u2019s careers and lives will depend on a woman who not only doesn\u2019t give a fuck about them but also lives in a world that confirms her prejudices. Those black women under her command won\u2019t have the same opportunities as a white man or a white woman under the same command\u2014even if the black women are as smart, talented and hardworking as their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t have a long career in the military. Maybe she\u2019ll get out and do one of the jobs most popular with military vets, like becoming a teacher or working in human resources or\u2014better yet\u2014law enforcement. I\u2019m sure her racism won\u2019t matter in those places.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nHere\u2019s another way that it works: A man with the IQ of a three-toed sloth could watch that racist rant and say to himself: \u201cHow in the hell is this racist? In fact, I think I\u2019m going to fire off a sternly worded email about this! And while I\u2019m at it ... why can\u2019t I say nigger?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a direct message from Twitter user Free Radical:\n\nHello Mike! I figure I\u2019ll get right to the point: I\u2019m a sheltered white person (Spokane is white as fuck and I\u2019m an isolated nerd) who has a question, but I\u2019m worried it might be racist to ask. For starters, I know that black people are not a monolith, and I can easily see how the very notion of \u2018asking black people\u2019 could be racist. Still, the question lingers in my head. It\u2019s probably not an original question, but Google has failed me a bit in finding a comprehensive discussion of the subject. I love The Root. I love that it challenges a lot of my notions, and I\u2019m very much a fan of your work, and you\u2019re the first person I thought of that might be able to point me in a direction in which I could educate myself. My question/issue is this: I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018To Pimp a Butterfly\u2019 a lot lately, and the more I listen to it, the more I\u2019m moved by it and the more I fall in love with it. I like to post songs and lyrics on my Facebook page and share them with my friends, and I want to share this album and these songs with my friends. My question pertains to using \u2018the n-word\u2019 when quoting black artists. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to infringe on black ownership of the word. On the other, I don\u2019t want to censor the artist\u2019s work when I\u2019m sharing it. I don\u2019t want to be one of these assholes who goes \u2018hey, if they use it, I can use it,\u2019 so I\u2019m at a bit of an internal impasse. Anyway, do you know of any big articles or videos discussing this specific subject (i.e. quoting lyrics)? Either way, thank you for your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Free:\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I honestly appreciate your question. I say this with no sarcasm intended. I think your heart is in the right place and I hope you will continue to read and learn from The Root. Here is your answer:\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nIntentional or not, your quandary is the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. You are not actively seeking to oppress or demean anyone. In fact, it seems as if you want to do the opposite. But the notion that you are even searching for the answer to this indicates that you mean no harm, but also illustrates how you get to live in a world where you get to raise this question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not accusing you of being a racist, and you seem to want an honest opinion. As a white person in America, you might not be as familiar with this concept as I and many other people of color are, but there is something you need to know:\n\nThere are some things you cannot do, simply because of the color of your skin. Most white people never learn this. Almost every black person has learned this lesson.\n\nYou. Cannot. Use. The. Word. Nigger.\n\nFull stop.\n\nI know, I know. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. But you must think of it this way:\n\nAt worst, you will have to suffer through the horrible possibility that you may have to wade through life under the oppression of never being able to post a Kendrick Lamar lyric on your Facebook page, with the only upside being that you have not inadvertently dredged up the history of lynching, slavery and white supremacy for the simple purpose of showing your internet friends how you totally relate to your favorite rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, on the plus side, you get to keep all your teeth!\n\nFrom: God Bless All Men & Women\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Prayers from white boy I pray that Jesus enters your heart and breaks the stone off of it that He loves all races as should we all. Saying all whites are this or all blacks are this is the same damn thing dont stoop to that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear God:\n\nIs that too informal? Should I call you Mr. or Ms. Women? Imma just stick with \u201cGod\u201d because I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re friends, being that you so lovingly reached out to me and you\u2019re praying for me and everything. After all, you love me. Shouldn\u2019t friends be on a first-name basis?\n\nWhen I refer to you as God, I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as blasphemous, as I do not mean to insinuate that I am talking to the God. I mean, even if I believed in her, I wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d be stupid and illiterate. I\u2019d know that the true and living God wouldn\u2019t just make shit up because she was feeling so injured by the words that one of the lowly creatures that she created wrote on the internet. I\u2019d know that any God who even insinuated such a thing was a false God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what I\u2019d tell that God? I\u2019d say: \u201cStop making shit up, you lying-ass motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019d tell that bullshit God who you just made up in an email to criticize me and make yourself feel good to show me where I said \u201call.\u201d \u201cShow me!\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\nYou know what that stone-heart-breaking Jesus God of yours would do? She\u2019d admit she was wrong and apologize. And then your made-up God and I would keep talking, and I\u2019d ask why, if she loves \u201call races\u201d so much like the email writer says, then why is the floor of the Atlantic Ocean littered with skeletons of black people thrown from slave ships? Why are we always the ones mopping up blood in Audubon Ballrooms or picking up bits of brain and bone on Memphis, Tenn., motel balconies? Were they not praying loud enough when Dylann Roof plopped down on that Charleston, S.C., church pew?\n\nI appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and I do not want to slander or attack any religion ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut your God obviously hates me, and I ain\u2019t letting that motherfucker nowhere near my heart.", "keywords": ["step", "jesus", "racist", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "god", "im", "dont", "racists", "person", "thing", "id", "mailbag", "game", "black", "need"], "polarity": 0.017008326732902996, "subjectivity": 0.48562764291577837},

Christ for a half-eaten bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, in a failed attempt to make a joke, I suggested that I was leaving The Root:\n\n\n\nIt was a joke, but the responses were both overwhelming and clapback-worthy. Some people took it seriously.\n\nOthers took the opportunity to dance on my nonexistent grave and let me know what wypipo think about me.\n\nFrom: Justin T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bye, nigger Good riddance! We are tired of reading your low crying about \u201cwhypipo\u201d every day. Maybe they are tired of you entitled worthless low IQ violent sexually aggressive fucking apes and we refuse to take the blame for your terrible culture and behavior anymore. Fuck you nigger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at least it provided me with an opening for this week\u2019s mailbag. Let us begin.\n\nOur first two pieces of correspondence come from the comments section on the article about Mansa Musa I:\n\nWhen Wakanda Was Real The reason people love superheroes is that, when done correctly, they are the perfect combination\u2026 Read more Read\n\nFrom: Rev Hillarious stuff. Reads like a joke from The Onion. All written on white man\u2019s technology, while you\u2019re safe under the roof designed by white men, built by white men, and you crawl back to your sad little existence, carrying that sad little excuse for a paycheck, signed by a white man. You want to experience all of the wonders and technology of a culture who\u2019s biggest contribution to the world was using their own as cattle? Knock yourself out, boy. I hear Liberia is LOVELY this time of year. What better place to enjoy the hard work and innovation of black people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, from Midland:\n\n\u201cMansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.\u201d As long as you are incapable of seeing great civilisations except by how they compare to Europe, you are still caught in the eurocentric trap. Also as you are not European, that is not self deprecation on your part, but weirdly aggressive xenophobia. If a European boastfully remarked at how much of a shithole xy or z non-European country was compared to a contemporary European country, you would rightfully note that person to be an idiot, so why do you ruin a very informative article by boorishly doing the same? \u201cInstead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation\u201d Because the violent conquering had already taken place and annexation is not a peaceful act anyway. Why do you feel the need to sanitise a powerful empire? Imperialism is not universally bad in all situations, it has been the human way for millenia. \u201cWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali.\u201d You sound almost gleeful. Western Europe also had universities, grand cathedrals and great market centres at this time. One of the reasons famine broke out was because countries like England had boomed since 1200 and by 1300 had a population estimated at between 5-6 million with more land cultivated than even in 1900. The Mali Empire\u2019s achievements at that time were clearly superior, but there is no need to denigrate other civilisations in a typically American fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow clap.\n\nJust when I thought I\u2019d seen the complete spectrum of white fragility, you come up with an entirely new category. I can only applaud your brilliance at the creative ways you find to be butt-hurt. To find a way to be offended about 14th-century historical facts is trailblazing. I honor you, sirs.\n\nI love when anyone, including Rev, refers to anything as \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d because it is indicative of the overarching intercontinental Caucasian pillaging mindset that has weaved its way through history. You motherfuckers will colonize anything! This may be presumptuous of me, but I\u2019m willing to bet all the money in my white man\u2019s paycheck that\u2014aside from his method of associating himself with Steve Jobs\u2019 computers and Al Gore\u2019s internet\u2014Rev hasn\u2019t invented a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know what I\u2019m gonna do, Rev? I\u2019m going to concede your point. If I am using the white man\u2019s technology and you are a white man, I\u2019m going to allow you to share credit for it. Using the transitive property, I\u2019m also going to give you shared credit for all white things. So Rev is responsible for Taylor Swift songs, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rape of Africa, the presidency of Donald Trump and the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWhich leads me to Midland.\n\nMidland, if you feel that I disparaged European countries, I apologize. But as you can see, it\u2019s not my fault. I know you are probably somewhere wrapped in a blanket, quietly weeping at how I denigrated your ancestral home team, but now you see: I be using the white man\u2019s things sometimes. According to Rev, it\u2019s your fault. Why don\u2019t you people take responsibility for your actions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for my part in this, I am willing to share in some of the blame. I recognize that since my people invented math, science, astronomy and agriculture before your people came over to Africa to study, steal and use it for atomic bomb-making, genocide and ravaging the earth, I am partially responsible for your salty, fuckboy tears of sorrow.\n\nI apologize.\n\nThe two recent articles on Boyce Watkins stirred up a lot of controversy about a lot of things. Two things, in particular, made their way to the mailbag. The first is from some of Watkins\u2019 adherents:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past year, I have come to understand a valuable truth about myself and one of my greatest weaknesses. Some may even call it an obsession. It is this:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see anyone take advantage of black people.\n\nIt makes me genuinely upset, and sometimes in my furor, I attack people. When I berate white people for their participation in white supremacy, some of the people who age like buttermilk left in the back seat of a Buick on a summer day (see ... there I go again) believe that it means I hate all white people. When I call out preachers who use the Bible as a means of spreading white people\u2019s messaging while stuffing their pockets with black people\u2019s hard-earned money, some Jesus worshippers view it as an attack on Christianity.\n\nAnd, yes, when I impugn the characters of people like Umar Johnson and Boyce Watkins for using the plight of black people to enrich themselves by duping people who have fallen prey to their cult of personality, as well as to trade in homophobia, misogyny and transphobia, some see it as an attack on black people, Pan-Africanism and cultural knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am fine with that.\n\nI realize that some white people believe in whiteness like some Christians believe in their pastors, like some black people believe in anyone who feeds them a fetishized bullshit narrative. Those people have faith. I will never change their minds because they believe in the people, not the ideas.\n\nBut I won\u2019t stop trying.\n\nBecause\u2014even when they\u2019re black\u2014those people are using blackness as a way to target my people. Johnson and Watkins are no different from Creflo Dollar or the Democratic Party. They mean us no good. They just want power and money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the entire time I\u2019ve written for The Root, I have never had a white person tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t write. In fact, aside from the directive from my black editors that I couldn\u2019t call Ray Lewis a \u201ccoon\u201d that one time, I have never been told by anyone what I couldn\u2019t say at The Root. No, we are not black-owned. But we are operated and run by black people and use our platform for black people. But I\u2019m sure that when you\u2019re typing your comments on white-owned Facebook\u2019s platform, Mark Zuckerberg sends you a private message telling you what you can and can\u2019t say.\n\nSo while you think you are dissing me for calling out charlatans, con men and people who scream about white supremacy only because they want the opportunity to get rich and control women, gays and transgender people, I actually take it as a compliment.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nAnd, finally, Boyce Watkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore last week, I had never followed Boyce Watkins and was only marginally aware of him. It was members of the Black Business School who pointed out this story to The Root and gave us the specifics, which means that if he feels attacked, he should confront his own customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Watkins is upset with The Root. He is pretending to be upset because his stream of revenue has been threatened. Who else is he going to attack\u2014the white guy and Asian guy who called him a \u201ccharacter\u201d whom they use to sell \u201chope and emotion\u201d as a \u201creligion\u201d to black people? They\u2019re his business partners. They created and control the \u201ceducational product\u201d he sells. Except for the email where he called their comments \u201crude and culturally insensitive,\u201d he has not distanced himself from the guys who said publicly, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to educate them.\u201d He remains in bed with people who don\u2019t seem to give a fuck about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during this whole ordeal, I gave Watkins the benefit of the doubt, as did some of the members of his organization who spoke with us. We all believed that he was being duped, too. They figured that he probably had no idea that the medicine he was selling to black people was just a placebo. But now I think differently.\n\nDespite the fact that he has not disproven a single fact in the story and, in fact, confirmed them all, Watkins has defended himself by telling his people that he was not given the opportunity to speak on the record:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is this:\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 2, four days before this story went live, I sent Watkins an email inviting him to speak on the record. I sent a media request to Watkins\u2019 personal page. I sent him a message on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he has continued to publicly say that he was not contacted, despite the fact that we posted his company\u2019s entire email response to the article. When he made these public statements, the petty part of me posted screenshots of my attempts to contact him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly deleted them.\n\nWatkins might not be a con man. He might be serious about helping black people achieve financial freedom. Maybe he believes that working with men who don\u2019t care about black people is the only way he can achieve his goals. But there is one thing you can be sure of:\n\n\n\nBoyce Watkins is a liar.", "keywords": ["mans", "clapback", "roots", "white", "watkins", "fact", "rev", "im", "way", "dont", "mailbag", "apology", "black", "using"], "polarity": 0.02524870962370963, "subjectivity": 0.4430071086321085},

As we close out 2017, we would like to thank our haters because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without you. (Actually, we do know where we\u2019d be without you. We\u2019d be fractionally happier, I\u2019d probably have a better relationship with Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan, and the writers at The Root wouldn\u2019t have a faint sense of dread every time they open an email.)\n\nBut without you, none of this would have been possible. I\u2019d probably have to spend my Friday mornings doing something besides conjuring up the spirit of Ric Flair, so from all of us to all of you, we offer a sincere thumbs-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finger in the middle is the thumb, right?\n\nOur first selection pertains to a piece that serves as a yearly divining rod for white tears: the 2017 Wypipo Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst this comment from Iceseller:\n\nHey look everyone. The racist in chief of this racist blog wrote something racist again! How edgy. Fuck off you racist piece of shit. Maybe 2018 will see you fired and have to be racist somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis email from the cleverly named U. R. Gay:\n\nFrom U.R. Gay\n\nTo: Michael Harriot What If a white person wrote something the 2017 nigger awards you would call them a racist. You are a world-class racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this comment from Kodimah:\n\nImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\n\nDearest Iceseller, Mr. or Ms. Gay, and Kodimah:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Iceseller for pre-emptively naming me to the position of \u201cracist in chief,\u201d but as a firm believer in democracy, I cannot, in good conscience, accept the title without a vote of some kind. While your admiration for me is appreciated, there are candidates far more qualified who could serve in this position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the aforementioned Mr. Gay, for instance (I don\u2019t want to gender-profile anyone, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that U.R. Gay is a guy). He seems like a perfect nominee for the position. He said that I am a \u201cworld-class racist,\u201d which means he has apparently traveled the world ranking them. I would think that he would be a better fit to serve as the king of all racists.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to push this conversation forward by pointing out something that seems obvious to me but has obviously flown over the heads of some of our readers. The Root is a publication that covers black America. Racism against black people is a problem in America. We write about it. We are no more obsessed with race than Deadspin is obsessed with sports, The Takeout is obsessed with food, Jalopnik is obsessed with cars or Jezebel is obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It is literally my job to talk about race.\n\nI think Kodimah put it best when he or she said: \u201cImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain what white privilege is:\n\nImagine living in a building with a sniper waiting outside. Imagine that, every day, the sniper shot someone who was exiting your building. Sometimes the sniper was in full sight, and other days the sniper was hidden, but he kept shooting at the people who lived in the building as they walked out.\n\nWhite privilege is the ability to say, \u201cYeah, but people in other buildings get shot, too.\u201d White privilege is the penchant for residents of safer buildings to ask why you don\u2019t just move out of the building. White privilege is being able to say, \u201cYeah, snipers exist, but you can\u2019t worry about them all the time.\u201d But most of all, white privilege is the oblivious idiocy of standing on the sidewalk and asking someone who could be killed by a sniper at any minute, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with snipers?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine reading a piece of satire written by a resident of the building, making fun of snipers. There is only one reason that I can surmise why anyone would be more angry at the person making jokes about snipers than they were at actual snipers:\n\nBecause they are a sniper, too.\n\nKodimah is right.\n\nIt is sad.\n\nFrom: Stephanie\n\nTo: The Root Staff The Root, I\u2019ve been a supporter for a long time. The fact that Skip Gates is a founder spoke to me about your integrity. Lately, I\u2019ve seen way too much cussing and specifically F bombs in your posts.\n\nIt\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s vulgar and common.\n\nIt\u2019s BENEATH you. As professional journalists and editors, if you must cuss to get your point across, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Tired of it,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie, I get your point. I really do.\n\nMy mother is a wise woman and she, too, was a writer. When I was a kid, she forbade us from using vulgar language, including calling someone a \u201cdog,\u201d a \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d She only had two exceptions:\n\nif we were telling a story and the person in the story said the vulgar word or phrase if we could make a logical case why the word was necessary\n\nThose rules are basically the same rules to which we adhere at The Root. I know I have a foul mouth, and I am often asked by the editors and copy editors if a certain word is necessary. Sometimes they change those words without even asking me. I don\u2019t even have a problem with that because I know I can be hyperbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you are a regular reader of The Root, then you know we use a million creative insults, euphemisms and allusions to replace dirty words. I reject the idea that there are \u201cbad words\u201d or that using vulgar language is a sign of a lack of intelligence, and here is why:\n\nSome people are motherfuckers.\n\nThere is a difference between not giving a darn and not giving a fuck. Knocking the crap out of a person is different from slapping the shit out of someone. Sometimes the words you consider to be boorish are the ones that perfectly describe a situation or thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRacism, homophobia, discrimination and Donald Trump are vulgar. Tamping down the description of those things by playing lexical dodgeball with the vocabulary to preserve the pearls that our readers may clutch is not our job.\n\nA few days ago I wrote a story about a Sacramento, Calif., policeman named John Tennis who had a habit of trying to hit black suspects with his car. He shot multiple black people and killed at least two. Even his fellow police officers said that he often discharged his weapon when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Raheem Hosseini of the Sacramento News and Review wrote a puff piece about him that made him into a sympathetic figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could have called them both colostomy bags filled with racism and prejudice. I could have used flowery language to explain how Tennis exemplified the persistent deadly threat posed by men whose uniforms have become a license to cosplay as executioners. I probably could have blistered Hosseini as an entitled equivocator who uses black lives as a stepladder to get closer to the spotlight while using his pen to blot out the bloodstains of the slaughtered innocent. But no ...\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nWhenever we write about Umar Johnson, we get a lot of email from his followers. Here are three:\n\nA direct Twitter message from Kwesi X:\n\nDear sir, I am from overseas and would like to let you know how sick you make me. Why you\u2019ve spent all your time gunning for Dr umar I\u2019ll never know I just want u to answer, How many kids u council? How many people u visited in jail to do free speaking events? Even if u don\u2019t like umar if u really a journalist of credibility you would have presented a balanced article not a I hate umar hit story. You are a fake black owned company that is simply marketed to black people. But your not really helping are you? Just making money on the drama You should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear sirs,\n\nFirst of all, no one who is originally from outside the country says that he is \u201cfrom overseas.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you. You need more Hotep people.\n\nI admit that I am conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a derogatory term because I know the history of the word, but I will also confess that when I was assigned the Umar story, I thought, \u201cHere come the Hoteppers.\u201d I am also tired of writing about Umar Johnson, but I think it is my responsibility. I don\u2019t hate Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cblack consciousness,\u201d any more than I hate the bullshit of prosperity gospel, except for one fact:\n\nHe steals from black people.\n\nLet me be clear:\n\nI believe that black people should know their history. I believe that our connection to our ancestors is important. I believe that there should be a school for black boys with an African-centered education. I desperately hope that someone builds one. I hope there comes a day when there is one in every city and black children can learn how the great Greek philosophers had to go to Africa to get their knowledge, and how the noble, ancient Europeans were bitch-slapped by the Moors and learned agriculture, irrigation, science and astronomy from dark people. One day someone will come with a plan to build and fund this dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that day comes, there will be people who say, \u201cI would donate, but the last time I gave money to something like this, a charlatan who claimed to be a descendant of Frederick Douglass conned me out of my coins.\u201d They will remember how he answered his phone while it was ringing and puffed up his chest whenever anyone asked him to show his Ph.D. People will recall how he publicly preached about the black family while fucking exotic dancers on the low-low. Some will bring up the fact that the last guy who was going to build a school would never show the receipts for how he spent the money.\n\nUmar Johnson\u2019s antics actually make it harder to build this school. If anyone ever achieves the goal of making this a reality, it will be in spite of Umar Johnson, not because of him.\n\nAnd we are not anti-Umar. When everyone doubted Johnson\u2019s degree, it was The Root that spent money to verify his Ph.D. and end the speculation. I am the one who spent days combing through yearbooks and graduation programs hoping that he was legitimate. When I found the evidence, I admitted that I was wrong. In. The. Headline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also the one who has refused to shade him even as I am constantly contacted by people in and outside the \u201cconscious movement\u201d who claim to have personal knowledge that always turns out to be spurious because they have a beef with Johnson.\n\nNo one here hates Umar Johnson.\n\nWe just like the truth.", "keywords": ["cusswords", "sniper", "racist", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "old", "awards", "obsessed", "root", "dont", "friend", "umar", "word", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": -0.019970001889644755, "subjectivity": 0.5327755247398107},

During this year\u2019s Carnival in Brazil, blackface made an appearance not only on the streets but also in the parades of three samba schools: Mangueira, Salgueiro and Beija Flor.\n\nUnlike the United States, where black men are the main subjects of blackface, black women are the main targets of blackface in Brazil. Nega Maluca is a white man\u2019s interpretation of a black woman. She\u2019s usually represented as a person painted black with an Afro wig, domestic servant\u2019s outfit, large breasts and exaggerated facial features.\n\n\u201cNega Maluca stereotypes and ridicule[s] the black woman, sexualizing her and stereotyping her as a sex object. She has big breasts and large lips,\u201d Eliane Pereira, a lawyer in Rio de Janeiro, tells The Glow Up. \u201cThis comes from the time period of slavery, when we were colonized and the black woman was always seen as an object. This woman does not represent me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe history of the Nega Maluca blackface is closely intertwined with the history of black women in Brazil. The 1950s Carnival song \u201cNega Maluca\u201d tells the story of a black woman who works as a domestic servant and is impregnated by her white boss\u2014something that was common back then. When she demands that the father claim the baby, she is called a \u201cnega maluca\u201d\u2014a crazy black woman.\n\nIn the 75 years after slavery ended in Brazil, the most common form of work for a black woman was working as a domestic servant, often living in her boss\u2019s house. To popularize the song, the composer started to include the image of Nega Maluca, interpreted by a white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis history of Nega Maluca is hidden on the internet, because today, Nega Maluca is also the name of a Brazilian chocolate cake.\n\nLawyer Marina Mar\u00e7al dreamed of parading with the Mangueira samba school\u2014Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most prestigious and traditional samba school. A samba school is a cultural organization created by blacks in Rio de Janeiro 90 years ago to celebrate samba music during Carnival. Since their founding, the groups have evolved into Brazil\u2019s biggest Carnival attraction. Thousands of costumed people parade each year in the biggest schools.\n\nMar\u00e7al joined the Mangueira school as a \u201ccommunity\u201d member\u2014a discounted way to participate in the Carnival parade without having to pay an outrageous fee, and the main way blacks participate in Carnival. One month after she joined the school, she learned that one of the sections would have some people dressed in the Nega Maluca costume.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMar\u00e7al says that she tried to reason with Mangueira\u2019s officials. She explained the racist history of the costume and why it should not be in the school\u2019s parade. But she said that school officials disagreed and kept the costume in the parade because they felt it was art and not racism.\n\n\n\n\u201cRacism is not an opinion but a crime,\u201d said Mar\u00e7al, who will soon receive a master\u2019s degree in race relations. \u201cWhen you are showing a racist persona of a black woman in a section that includes black women who are saying that Nega Maluca is very offensive, those concerns ought to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nMar\u00e7al left the Mangueira samba school, and for the last two months, she has tried to educate as many people as possible about the racist origins of the Nega Maluca costume. Seventeen black women were interviewed for a documentary on its origins titled, Nega Maluca N\u00e3o. And Rio de Janeiro\u2019s women\u2019s law association hosted a forum on Nega Maluca right before Carnival.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven a parade that exalted the history and heritage of black women used blackface.\n\nThe theme for the Salgueiro samba school was \u201cSenhoras do Ventre do Mundo,\u201d which translates to \u201cWomen of the Womb of the World,\u201d meant to celebrate the history of black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe school\u2019s dance group was composed of men dressed as women, with their faces painted black. The costumes of the drum section, consisting of black and white people, were inspired by the images of the 25th dynasty of Nubia, and those performers also had their faces painted black. But while the public loved their celebration of black women, the blackface costumes dominated the social media discussion.\n\nA modern form of blackface also reared its head at this year\u2019s street Carnival festivities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinger Jojo Todynho\u2019s song \u201cQue Tiro Foi Esse (What Are These Gunshots)\u201d is a hit in Brazil. But before her popular funk song brought her national fame, she was well-known on the internet for proudly displaying her triple-G breasts in skimpy Brazilian bikinis. This Carnival, she became a costume, with white women and men wearing large, fake brown breasts and black wigs and sometimes even painting their skin dark.\n\nBut though the tradition continues, there is increasing resistance. In Minas Gerais, the carnival bloco Domesticas de Lixo (Male Domestic Servants of Trash) consists of white men who dress up as black domestic servants as a way to pay homage to the domestic servant. This year, several black YouTube bloggers mounted a campaign against the bloco, which celebrated its 60th anniversary by receiving a key to the city from the mayor. At least a dozen Afro-Brazilians protested the bloco\u2019s parade two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMar\u00e7al says that she thinks blackface in Brazil will end only if Brazilians start listening to Afro-Brazilian women.\n\n\u201cCarnival comes from black culture, but they ignore the opinions of black people,\u201d she says.\n\n", "keywords": ["brazils", "blackface", "women", "carnival", "white", "nega", "2018", "maluca", "samba", "school", "woman", "misogynoir", "black"], "polarity": -0.047854526425955016, "subjectivity": 0.4117739403453689},

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

In fact, we could do a Clapback Mailbag every day if we wanted to post the messages we receive from white people who want to share data about how fucked up black people are. These are only two examples. Warning: The first one is extremely long, but we included it because it is most representative of many of the emails we get regarding this subject.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA direct message from Twitter user @RicciBicci:\n\nAfrican Americans accounted for 52.5% of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008. Black people make up 12.5% of the population. Let that sink in... But go on dodge, duck and use the whatever excuse you want. An no I\u2019m not a racist etc so don\u2019t even use that card. Just think you are terrible for black people.\n\nAnd this:\n\nFrom: Tyler\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Black on Black Crime Michael, Please see my proven statistical response to your roots article on black on black crime. Also, you can see in my pic I am what you would call a black man 1. Data shows that 93 percent of black homicide victims are killed by other blacks. The left\u2019s rebuttal is that that 84 percent of white homicide victims are killed by other whites, but The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley points outthat the white crime rate is \u201cmuch lower than the black rate.\u201d 2. FBI Statistics: \u201cBlacks commit violent crimes at 7 to 10 times the rate that whites do.\u201d Blacks committed 52 percent of homicides between 1980 and 2008, despite composing just 13 percent of the population. Across the same timeframe, whites committed 45 percent of homicides while composing 77% of the population, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Here are some more statistics from the FBI: In 2013, the FBI has black criminals carrying out 38 per cent of murders, compared to 31.1 per cent for whites. The offender\u2019s race was \u201cunknown\u201d in 29.1 per cent of cases. What about violent crime more generally? FBI arrest rates are one way into this. Over the last three years of data \u2013 2011 to 2013 \u2013 38.5 per cent of people arrested for murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault were black. 3. Black crime is even more prevalent in the country\u2019s largest cities and counties. Heather Mac Donald writes in her book The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe that in Chicago, IL, blacks committed 76 percent of all homicides, despite composing 35 percent of the city\u2019s population. Blacks also accounted for 78 percent of all juvenile arrests. Whites, who compose 28 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 4 percent of its homicides and 3.5 percent of its juvenile arrests. Hispanics, who compose 30 percent of the city\u2019s population, committed 19 percent of its homicides and 18 percent of its juvenile arrests. (Another eye-opening fact from Mac Donald\u2019s research is that only 26 percent of murder cases were solved in Chicago.) Blacks are 10 percent of the population in Los Angeles, CA, but commit 42 percent of its robberies and 34 percent of its felonies. Whites make up 29 percent of the city\u2019s population, and commit 5 percent of its robberies and 13 percent of its felonies. In New York City, blacks committed \u201c75 percent of all shootings, 70 percent of all robberies, and 66 percent of all violent crime,\u201d despite only composing 23 percent of the population, said Mac Donald in a Hillsdale speech. Additionally, 2009 Bureau of Justice Statistics numbers show that in 2009, \u201cblacks were charged with 62 percent of robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising roughly 15 percent of the population in these counties.\u201d 4. There were almost 6,000 blacks killed by other blacks in 2015. By contrast, only 258 blacks were killed by police gunfire that year. 5. The percentage of blacks arrested for crimes is consistent with police reports. This is according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, as well as this 1985 study: \u201cEven allowing for the existence of discrimination in the criminal justice system, the higher rates of crime among black Americans cannot be denied,\u201d wrote James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein in their classic 1985 study, \u201cCrime and Human Nature.\u201d \u201cEvery study of crime using official data shows blacks to be overrepresented among persons arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for street crimes.\u201d This was true decades before the authors put it to paper, and it remains the case decades later. \u201cThe overrepresentation of blacks among arrested persons persists throughout the criminal justice system,\u201d wrote Wilson and Herrnstein. \u201cThough prosecutors and judges may well make discriminatory judgments, such decisions do not account for more than a small fraction of the overrepresentation of blacks in prison.\u201d This data disproves the notion that racism is what drives higher rates of arrests among the blacks than among whites or broader America. 6. According to the FBI, \u201cBlack crime rates were lower in the 1940s and 1950s, when black poverty was higher\u201d and \u201cracial discrimination was rampant and legal.\u201d If it\u2019s not racism and poverty that are blame for the high black crime rate, then what is? ***7. According to Mac Donald, \u201cA straight line can be drawn between family breakdown and youth violence.\u201d Hence has nothing to do with white supremacy. As economist Thomas Sowell points out, before the 1960s \u201cmost black children were raised in two-parent families.\u201d In 2013, over 72 percent of blacks were born out of wedlock. In Cook County \u2013which Chicago belongs to \u2013 79 percent of blacks were born to single mothers in 2003, while only 15 percent of whites were born to single mothers. \u201cUntil that gap closes, the crime gap won\u2019t close, either,\u201d writes Mac Donald. When are we as a people from all different color pigment will stop labeling each other as a color which diminishes our self worth and start describing ourselves as Red Blooded Americans who are either male or female that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Ricci and Tyler, I\u2019ll bite. I\u2019m going to accept all of your points before I dismantle them one by one:\n\nYou\u2019re not racist: If you\u2019re not racist, then you couldn\u2019t possibly believe that black people are somehow inherently or genetically more violent than whites. We know study after study shows that crime is a socioeconomic problem, so if blacks commit more violent crimes, could it possibly be that the black population is in a worse socioeconomic position than whites? You\u2019re not racist, remember, so it can\u2019t mean blacks are lazier, less willing to work or dumber, so what accounts for the disparity in income and education?\n\nBlack-on-black crime: Again, I accept your premise that blacks are responsible for black-on-black crime. But I must have missed your follow-up email that shows where black people don\u2019t care about that fact. I missed the part where you acknowledged that there are far more \u201cStop the violence\u201d marches and organizations dedicated to neighborhood violence than there are Black Lives Matter chapters. I probably turned a blind eye to your Twitter DM about anti-gang chapters. The message you sent about news organizations ignoring fraternal organizations, charities and nonprofits in black communities addressing these problems probably went into my spam folder. Strong black families are the cure: I agree with you on this one. In fact, I am working to put an end to all the black churches, black leaders and random influential Negroes who tell black people to keep fucking and stop caring for their kids. I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that, but conservatives and racists often bring it up as if black people don\u2019t care about these things, so it must be true. I\u2019m glad you agree with me on this one. Black people can\u2019t do two things at once: When black people talk about police-brutality and mass-incarceration rates, we ignore the impact that voting, community involvement and personal responsibility can have on our plight. Apparently, you two believe that black people focus on racism instead of concentrating on these other issues, and not in conjunction with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicci and Tyler, my point is this: You bring up these facts as if people who talk about racism aren\u2019t aware of them. As if we ignore them because we\u2019d rather blame everything on the white man. We don\u2019t. We know that part of the reason for the plight of black people in America is that we need to do better. We are trying to help each other do better. But when people like you two regurgitate the Fox News narrative that diminishes the role that white people, racism and the history of white supremacy in America play in black oppression, it is idiotic and tone-deaf.\n\nWhen you present this bullshit to black people as a counterargument to a discussion about police brutality or white supremacy, it means that you are either unaware that black people agree with these things, too, or it means that you are racist.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be racist.\n\nI know this because Ricci said it, and Tyler proved it by sending me this picture of himself:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did a Google Images search for this picture and found it all over the internet, including on the cover of a book. But I\u2019m sure Ty is a male model who just happens to dabble in statistical data that shows how dumb, violent and inferior black people are.\n\nHe\u2019s not a racist, though.\n\nEarlier this week, on the birthday of President Abraham Lincoln, staff writer Monique Judge took the opportunity to remind readers of the historical fact that the president called \u201cthe Great Emancipator\u201d did not free the slaves. Again, that is not her opinion; it is a fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nFrom: Andre Hickman The problem the problem with this article lies in the interpretation of The Human Condition. this false narrative that there are no white people who cared about black people during slavery or anytime before or after is completely dishonest and one sided.\n\nFrom Lincoln Gaffney: Monique, I sincerely do not know what you hope to accomplish with this piece. But assuming you care about equality among humans and this nation/world continuing on the path towards a \u2018more perfect union\u2019, I believe this kind of tone and content undercuts those aims that I care deeply about myself. To say Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t care about black people is simply and factually false. The sad but unavoidable fact is that, in 1860, pretty much all politicians\u2014 even the more enlightened and radical among them like Lincoln, Chase, Seward\u2014 did not believe in overall equality of the \u2018races\u2019 Race is a myth that has been used to oppress and divide people over time; there is but one race, the human race; if you truly care about that idea becoming a reality, I would respectfully suggest not trying to make one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist. Unlike the current Republican President, who actually is and is kinda proud of it. Lincoln was a radical in his time, and you are making him out to be the reactionary. It is unfair and I believe also hurtful to the propagation of equality. Peace, Lincoln Gaffney\n\nDearest Andre and Lincoln:\n\nI write to you from the darkest crevices of blackness, where neither light nor white tears dare approach. It is the two thousand and eighteenth year of our lord and saviors Desus & Mero, and you have taken time out of your busy schedule to inform a black woman that white people actually \u201ccared about black people during slavery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, you point to ... umm ... well, nothing.\n\nLincoln was not against slavery. He was against the expansion of slavery. If he did not believe that blacks were subhuman pieces of property, or shouldn\u2019t be American citizens, he would not have offered to pay reparations to slaveholders and ship black people back to Africa.\n\nSince the beginning of the history of this great country, the overwhelming majority of white people in America have spent every day of their entire lives not shedding a bead of sweat to end slavery, Jim Crow or institutional racism. Lincoln, your \u201crespectful\u201d suggestion that Monique not \u201cmake one of the most heroic and noble leaders ever in the US out to be a racist\u201d simply means that you don\u2019t understand what racism is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine if you lived in a house with a group of bank robbers and shared the spoils of their robberies. You spent the money they stole and lived in the houses they bought with the cash. Not only that, but you knew about the bank robberies and said nothing, even when people asked you to help them stop the bank-robbing crew. You know what you\u2019d be called?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou\u2019re white.\n\nFinally, a comment regarding the following article:\n\nFrom: Dude at a Computer Honest question. At what point will the black population let go of the past? I\u2019m not asking for everyone to forget the past but stop using it as a crutch for societal and economic woes. I understand your points you made in the article but when will it actually end? I think it would help if we (everybody) were able to put a finger on it and say \u201cwhen we get here as a society, we can stop talking about the past (but never forget)\u201c? It does not have to end tomorrow, or next year or next decade. I\u2019m just wondering at what point can/should/will it stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dude,\n\nUnlike the previous morons, you actually pose a salient question. While I cannot give an exact date, I can give you a list of markers that will indicate when black people will ultimately let go of the past and stop using it as a crutch:\n\nwhen black children are afforded the opportunity to attend schools in black neighborhoods that are funded as well as white schools;\n\nwhen the black unemployment rate is equal to the white unemployment rate;\n\nwhen black people with the same education and experience aren\u2019t paid less than their white counterparts;\n\nwhen police don\u2019t shoot black men disproportionately regardless of the crime rate;\n\nwhen employers stop throwing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black-sounding names in the garbage;\n\nwhen white women in parking lots don\u2019t clutch their purses when I walk by;\n\nwhen people like you stop coming to black websites to read about racism and end up butt-hurt;\n\nwhen white people stop telling black people how to react to their oppression;\n\nwhen the history of what white people have done to blacks for 500 years is no longer regarded by whites as inconsequential as they explain away white supremacy by using the Constitution, laws and the legacy of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d;\n\nwhen I, as a black man, can finally believe that my work, my children\u2019s existence and my entire life are totally and completely unaffected by the color of my skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then ...\n\nI\u2019ll see you next week.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "population", "roots", "blacks", "white", "racism", "crime", "lincoln", "facts", "mailbag", "black", "stop"], "polarity": -0.005896180591062515, "subjectivity": 0.4246456834941086},

Let\u2019s just say she might be a deputy managing editor at The Root.) I honestly think I should get disability and one of those parking decals so I can park up front and rush in.\n\nMy late-motherfucker-ness came in handy today because this was a slow week for hate mail.

I thank my Irish side for never being a late Negro. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example of how being a late motherfucker works, our first item is a comment from JC-Sean, who took umbrage with me calling Post Malone a \u201ccultural appropriator\u201d in a post from a few hours ago.\n\n\u201cCultural appropriation\u201d is the very definition of hypocrisy. Our society is a mixing pot of culture, meaning everyone from every background takes some aspects of another previous society and implements them to their needs. I needn\u2019t list off the dozens of things white culture has created that black culture has taken advantage of. If Post doesn\u2019t want to be known as a rapper and simply as a musician, who are you to question him? If society relies on pure feelings as it is, then what makes his claim unjustified in comparison?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear JC-Sean:\n\nI was all set to clap back at your white nonsense about cultural appropriation. It was going to be good, too. I was going to write how you, like many others who present this ignorant argument, have no idea what cultural appropriation actually means. I was going to explain to you like you are 5 years old how cultural appropriation has nothing to do with taking \u201caspects of another previous society\u201d and using them for one\u2019s needs.\n\nDamn, JC, I was going to roast your ass for being so dumb that you think using an art form, invention or technique created by another culture is \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d My best line was going to be, \u201cNigga, I\u2019m not accusing every motherfucker who uses fire or a wheel of stealing from Cro-Magnon man!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I was going to rip apart your kindergarten-slow-class-like logic by explaining that there is a difference between Eminem immersing himself in a culture, respecting it and contributing to the art form and Post Malone using the art form to make millions while simultaneously saying: \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with those niggers. I\u2019m a musician, not a rapper.\u201d Then I was going to explain how he gets to dabble in the stereotype of hip-hop while enjoying the privilege of not having to deal with the consequences.\n\nMy only problem was, I needed an analogy to illustrate my argument. If only there were some incident that could show how Malone\u2019s whiteness means that he isn\u2019t treated like the black artists he emulates with his Caucasian step-and-fetch-it-ery. I desperately needed a way to prove that Malone gets to enjoy the societal privilege of being white and pocket the money from his pseudo-black stereotype. I must admit, JC, that I was stuck.\n\nAnd then this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that is Post Malone, on video in Las Vegas, the recent site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, riding around with a machine gun mounted atop a truck.\n\nPost Malone is not in jail.\n\nPost Malone is still alive.\n\nShut the fuck up, JC.\n\nOur next clapback comes from an accident:\n\n\n\nYesterday, while searching for something on the internet, Producer Danielle Young discovered that there is a whole section of YouTube devoted to black conservatives clapping back at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are two of my favorites:\n\nAnd this dude, who calls himself \u201cUncle Hotep\u201d and spends a lot of time attacking black people in videos:\n\nI must be honest: I thoroughly enjoyed these niggas, in the same way people enjoy watching Bumfights and Jackass. I actually subscribed to their channels after watching a few of their videos because I sometimes need to remind myself what the opposite of \u201cself-aware\u201d is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext week, no one will be talking about the Erykah Badu article or that wig-wearing mop bucket who called April Ryan out of her name, and I can use these videos to help me become a better person.

They love when writers like you promulgate victim hood because it keeps people victims. When the black Fordham law professor wtites an article saying black people are disabled(link below), they cheer. If a person is disabled or a victim, they need help. So yeah, they\u2019ll keep giving those crumbs to the victims....in exchange for votes. They won\u2019t tell the victims they can succeed through hard work and making good decisions.(see Asian and black immigrants) Then they wouldn\u2019t need the Democrat\u2019s loving help. It\u2019s ethereal whiteness that\u2019s holding people back. Hmm, something that can\u2019t be quantified so can never be proven to be ended.

After reading all of this, I sympathized with you because I quickly realized that one of my theories is correct:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nI realized this because Paul-Emile specifically wrote, \u201cBlackness, of course, is not, by itself, an impairment.\u201d Then I realized, after noting that the article explains that she is using the concept of disability law because \u201cit accurately reflects what Black, as a racial designation, is and was designed to be: disabling. Racial categories were created explicitly to serve as a caste system to privilege some and disadvantage others ... ,\u201d that you probably didn\u2019t read that part, because it is in the first sentence!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what white people like you will do.\n\nYou plant the seeds of racism in every square inch of fertile soil, and when the poisonous flowers bloom, you wonder why we\u2019re sick.

You are a scourge of humanity, Dj. You are a monster.

I\u2019ve also ran into quite a few black people with attitude in my life,as have I ran into alot of white people with attitude. ..no difference. ..attitude is attitude. Race dont mean shit when it comes to attitude. But since shes not black...then shes a racist?? Pfft. Ok,then...good luck with that. How about Mr. Chi from SNL... he called Trump a \u201ccracker\u201d tell me, why in the hell is that NOT racist? Cracker IS a racial slur when referring to whites. How about all the blacks that call each other \u201cnigger\u201d...if black people say it, its NOT racist, but anyone else... they\u2019re racist.

She also holds an innate prejudice against black women, as do many others. In her world, her feelings are so uncontroversial and widespread that she was comfortable enough to share them on the internet.\n\nI presume that the airwoman, as a member of the Air Force, will be promoted multiple times. She will undoubtedly have women of color under her command. Those women\u2019s careers and lives will depend on a woman who not only doesn\u2019t give a fuck about them but also lives in a world that confirms her prejudices. Those black women under her command won\u2019t have the same opportunities as a white man or a white woman under the same command\u2014even if the black women are as smart, talented and hardworking as their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t have a long career in the military. Maybe she\u2019ll get out and do one of the jobs most popular with military vets, like becoming a teacher or working in human resources or\u2014better yet\u2014law enforcement. I\u2019m sure her racism won\u2019t matter in those places.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nHere\u2019s another way that it works: A man with the IQ of a three-toed sloth could watch that racist rant and say to himself: \u201cHow in the hell is this racist? In fact, I think I\u2019m going to fire off a sternly worded email about this! And while I\u2019m at it ... why can\u2019t I say nigger?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a direct message from Twitter user Free Radical:\n\nHello Mike! I figure I\u2019ll get right to the point: I\u2019m a sheltered white person (Spokane is white as fuck and I\u2019m an isolated nerd) who has a question, but I\u2019m worried it might be racist to ask. For starters, I know that black people are not a monolith, and I can easily see how the very notion of \u2018asking black people\u2019 could be racist. Still, the question lingers in my head. It\u2019s probably not an original question, but Google has failed me a bit in finding a comprehensive discussion of the subject. I love The Root. I love that it challenges a lot of my notions, and I\u2019m very much a fan of your work, and you\u2019re the first person I thought of that might be able to point me in a direction in which I could educate myself. My question/issue is this: I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018To Pimp a Butterfly\u2019 a lot lately, and the more I listen to it, the more I\u2019m moved by it and the more I fall in love with it. I like to post songs and lyrics on my Facebook page and share them with my friends, and I want to share this album and these songs with my friends. My question pertains to using \u2018the n-word\u2019 when quoting black artists. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to infringe on black ownership of the word. On the other, I don\u2019t want to censor the artist\u2019s work when I\u2019m sharing it. I don\u2019t want to be one of these assholes who goes \u2018hey, if they use it, I can use it,\u2019 so I\u2019m at a bit of an internal impasse. Anyway, do you know of any big articles or videos discussing this specific subject (i.e. quoting lyrics)? Either way, thank you for your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Free:\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I honestly appreciate your question. I say this with no sarcasm intended. I think your heart is in the right place and I hope you will continue to read and learn from The Root. Here is your answer:\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nIntentional or not, your quandary is the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. You are not actively seeking to oppress or demean anyone. In fact, it seems as if you want to do the opposite. But the notion that you are even searching for the answer to this indicates that you mean no harm, but also illustrates how you get to live in a world where you get to raise this question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not accusing you of being a racist, and you seem to want an honest opinion. As a white person in America, you might not be as familiar with this concept as I and many other people of color are, but there is something you need to know:\n\nThere are some things you cannot do, simply because of the color of your skin. Most white people never learn this. Almost every black person has learned this lesson.\n\nYou. Cannot. Use. The. Word. Nigger.\n\nFull stop.\n\nI know, I know. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. But you must think of it this way:\n\nAt worst, you will have to suffer through the horrible possibility that you may have to wade through life under the oppression of never being able to post a Kendrick Lamar lyric on your Facebook page, with the only upside being that you have not inadvertently dredged up the history of lynching, slavery and white supremacy for the simple purpose of showing your internet friends how you totally relate to your favorite rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, on the plus side, you get to keep all your teeth!\n\nFrom: God Bless All Men & Women\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Prayers from white boy I pray that Jesus enters your heart and breaks the stone off of it that He loves all races as should we all. Saying all whites are this or all blacks are this is the same damn thing dont stoop to that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear God:\n\nIs that too informal? Should I call you Mr. or Ms. Women? Imma just stick with \u201cGod\u201d because I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re friends, being that you so lovingly reached out to me and you\u2019re praying for me and everything. After all, you love me. Shouldn\u2019t friends be on a first-name basis?\n\nWhen I refer to you as God, I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as blasphemous, as I do not mean to insinuate that I am talking to the God. I mean, even if I believed in her, I wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d be stupid and illiterate. I\u2019d know that the true and living God wouldn\u2019t just make shit up because she was feeling so injured by the words that one of the lowly creatures that she created wrote on the internet. I\u2019d know that any God who even insinuated such a thing was a false God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what I\u2019d tell that God? I\u2019d say: \u201cStop making shit up, you lying-ass motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019d tell that bullshit God who you just made up in an email to criticize me and make yourself feel good to show me where I said \u201call.\u201d \u201cShow me!\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\nYou know what that stone-heart-breaking Jesus God of yours would do? She\u2019d admit she was wrong and apologize. And then your made-up God and I would keep talking, and I\u2019d ask why, if she loves \u201call races\u201d so much like the email writer says, then why is the floor of the Atlantic Ocean littered with skeletons of black people thrown from slave ships? Why are we always the ones mopping up blood in Audubon Ballrooms or picking up bits of brain and bone on Memphis, Tenn., motel balconies? Were they not praying loud enough when Dylann Roof plopped down on that Charleston, S.C., church pew?\n\nI appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and I do not want to slander or attack any religion ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut your God obviously hates me, and I ain\u2019t letting that motherfucker nowhere near my heart.", "keywords": ["step", "jesus", "racist", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "god", "im", "dont", "racists", "person", "thing", "id", "mailbag", "game", "black", "need"], "polarity": 0.017008326732902996, "subjectivity": 0.48562764291577837},

I\u2019m not working beyond 10 a.m. So what a half-day means 1 p.m.? \u2014Yesha\n\nMerry Christmas, motherfuckers.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a fan of both Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party concerning the article about Doug Jones:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Starr C.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Who sent you? Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ... I\u2019m the one playing \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.", "keywords": ["identity", "insert", "clapback", "roots", "politics", "white", "women", "vote", "title", "wasnt", "told", "clever", "bernie", "mailbag", "voted", "black"], "polarity": 0.0626698244677697, "subjectivity": 0.450799465628233},
{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/say-her-name-marielle-franco-a-brazilian-politician-w-1823812564", "title": "/say-her-name-marielle-franco-a-brazilian-politician-w-", "text": "Photo: Renan Olaz (C\u00e2mara do Rio)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated.\n\nMarielle Franco, 38, a black politician from Rio de Janeiro, died fighting for the rights of women and favela dwellers. As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

She was strong, tall, elegant, gracious, and I saw myself in her. I cried because her beauty was the same type of beauty that I have. It was a relief to see her being celebrated. For many decades in the United States, I was not considered pretty. I was strange. They thought my skin was too dark. My arms and legs were very large.\n\nEvery year, 16 Afro-Brazilian women compete to become the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, an Afro-Bloco carnival group in Salvador, Brazil, that promotes black pride and Afro-Brazilian culture in Brazil. Afro-Brazilians in the neighborhood of Liberdade started Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea in 1975 in resistance to Salvador\u2019s carnival, which at the time excluded blacks. The group derives its heritage from Candombl\u00e9, an Afro-Brazilian religion traditionally led by women. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea has traditionally been a carnival group for dark-skinned black people in Salvador, and the contestants of the Beleza Negra pageant represent this aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal of the Beleza Negra is to represent black women in a way that Brazilian and international media fail to\u2014as strong, spirit-filled and divine. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s theme this year was \u201c100 Years of Madiba: Nelson Mandela\u201d; contestants represented this in their dresses. The winner of the pageant will now reign as the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s carnival, and her responsibilities include representing the Afro-Bloco in and outside Brazil, as well as dancing in carnival during the group\u2019s parade.\n\n\u201cThe Goddess of Ebony contest is a validation of representation,\u201d Neal, 35, told a Brazilian newspaper. \u201cIt is very much needed here, [and] all over the world. To me, it says, \u2018I am here, I am valid, I exist, I have a proud history, I have beautiful cultural narratives and I am not alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal traveled back to Salvador to prepare and compete, thanks to a fundraising campaign she started once she learned that Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea had accepted her application for the pageant. On the day she arrived, she went straight from the airport to her first practice with the other contestants, who ranged in age from 18 to their 40s. All but four came from Salvador.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was dropping a kitten in a bunny cage,\u201d said Neal, who is a director, filmmaker, photographer and writer. \u201cThe other contestants didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me. They didn\u2019t know if I was a novelty or serious competitor. I was fatigued, sweating, and my eyes were bloodshot from all the travel.\u201d\n\nShe made waves in Salvador and was featured on the front page of the local newspaper. The local population supported her participation in the pageant, which has traditionally been seen as a way to promote black women from local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that the overall impact has been positive,\u201d said Adrian Erik McCray, a longtime African-American expat in Salvador. \u201cThe fact that an African American\u2014\u2018an elite,\u2019 in the eyes of Brazil\u2014chose to participate in something that revives the resistance spirit of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea is something positive.\u201d\n\nOnce settled in Salvador, Neal scrambled desperately to find someone who could create the two required dresses\u2014one representing Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and another representing a deity. She then learned a special dance that\u2014more so than beauty\u2014defines the Ebony Goddess.\n\nNeal found a savior in 27-year-old Cec\u00edlia Cadile, an entrepreneur who placed third in last year\u2019s Beleza Negra. Cadile\u2019s involvement in the pageant dates back to when she was a teenager, when her sister competed in the pageant. In the two weeks before the pageant, Cadile worked as Neal\u2019s coach, teaching her the special Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea dance and helping to prepare her two dresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a already precious stone, and she only needed someone to help bring out the shine in her,\u201d Cadile said.\n\nContestants pose with last year\u2019s Deusa de \u00c9bano, Gisele Santos Soares.

Neal had already developed an intimate relationship with Afro-Brazilian culture and music through her participation in a Brazilian drumming group in the U.S., but she did not grow up with the rhythms and dances of Candombl\u00e9, a handicap she overcame within two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese women have been doing this all of their lives as part of their experience in Candomble,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born in Candombl\u00e9.\u201d\n\nWhen the moment came for her to perform her dance, Neal put her heart, soul and even stomach into it:\n\nRight before I was about to go on, we were standing in a narrow, one-window hallway backstage, and it was really uncomfortable. I was hot, I was breathless, I was dizzy, I needed to sit down, I needed to stand up. I needed to eat something, I needed to throw up ... all these contradictions! I perform and I\u2019m fine. As soon as I get offstage, I\u2019m sick again. I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m sleepy, I\u2019m awake ... then I\u2019m fine. I go to where I can see the rest of the contestants, and as they come offstage to the holding area, they\u2019re all going through the same or similar feelings as I am: hot, breathless, crying, shaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal didn\u2019t win the contest. The new Deusa de Ebano is J\u00e9ssica Almeida Nascimento dos Santos, 19, who hails from the Cabula neighborhood in Salvador.\n\n\u201cI felt like I did what I came to do and was satisfied,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI didn\u2019t win, obviously, but I feel emotionally amazing.\u201d", "keywords": ["competed", "goddess", "il\u00ea", "contestants", "pageant", "needed", "women", "afrobrazilian", "beauty", "ebony", "africanamerican", "aiy\u00ea", "neal", "im", "salvador", "queen", "woman"], "polarity": 0.10597478544846965, "subjectivity": 0.4534500075947444},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Christ for a half-eaten bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, in a failed attempt to make a joke, I suggested that I was leaving The Root:\n\n\n\nIt was a joke, but the responses were both overwhelming and clapback-worthy. Some people took it seriously.\n\nOthers took the opportunity to dance on my nonexistent grave and let me know what wypipo think about me.\n\nFrom: Justin T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bye, nigger Good riddance!

Fuck you nigger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut at least it provided me with an opening for this week\u2019s mailbag. Let us begin.\n\nOur first two pieces of correspondence come from the comments section on the article about Mansa Musa I:\n\nWhen Wakanda Was Real The reason people love superheroes is that, when done correctly, they are the perfect combination\u2026 Read more Read\n\nFrom: Rev Hillarious stuff. Reads like a joke from The Onion. All written on white man\u2019s technology, while you\u2019re safe under the roof designed by white men, built by white men, and you crawl back to your sad little existence, carrying that sad little excuse for a paycheck, signed by a white man. You want to experience all of the wonders and technology of a culture who\u2019s biggest contribution to the world was using their own as cattle? Knock yourself out, boy. I hear Liberia is LOVELY this time of year. What better place to enjoy the hard work and innovation of black people?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this one, from Midland:\n\n\u201cMansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.\u201d As long as you are incapable of seeing great civilisations except by how they compare to Europe, you are still caught in the eurocentric trap. Also as you are not European, that is not self deprecation on your part, but weirdly aggressive xenophobia. If a European boastfully remarked at how much of a shithole xy or z non-European country was compared to a contemporary European country, you would rightfully note that person to be an idiot, so why do you ruin a very informative article by boorishly doing the same? \u201cInstead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation\u201d Because the violent conquering had already taken place and annexation is not a peaceful act anyway. Why do you feel the need to sanitise a powerful empire? Imperialism is not universally bad in all situations, it has been the human way for millenia. \u201cWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali.\u201d You sound almost gleeful. Western Europe also had universities, grand cathedrals and great market centres at this time. One of the reasons famine broke out was because countries like England had boomed since 1200 and by 1300 had a population estimated at between 5-6 million with more land cultivated than even in 1900. The Mali Empire\u2019s achievements at that time were clearly superior, but there is no need to denigrate other civilisations in a typically American fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow clap.\n\nJust when I thought I\u2019d seen the complete spectrum of white fragility, you come up with an entirely new category. I can only applaud your brilliance at the creative ways you find to be butt-hurt. To find a way to be offended about 14th-century historical facts is trailblazing. I honor you, sirs.\n\nI love when anyone, including Rev, refers to anything as \u201cthe white man\u2019s\u201d because it is indicative of the overarching intercontinental Caucasian pillaging mindset that has weaved its way through history. You motherfuckers will colonize anything! This may be presumptuous of me, but I\u2019m willing to bet all the money in my white man\u2019s paycheck that\u2014aside from his method of associating himself with Steve Jobs\u2019 computers and Al Gore\u2019s internet\u2014Rev hasn\u2019t invented a damn thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you know what I\u2019m gonna do, Rev? I\u2019m going to concede your point. If I am using the white man\u2019s technology and you are a white man, I\u2019m going to allow you to share credit for it. Using the transitive property, I\u2019m also going to give you shared credit for all white things. So Rev is responsible for Taylor Swift songs, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the rape of Africa, the presidency of Donald Trump and the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWhich leads me to Midland.\n\nMidland, if you feel that I disparaged European countries, I apologize. But as you can see, it\u2019s not my fault. I know you are probably somewhere wrapped in a blanket, quietly weeping at how I denigrated your ancestral home team, but now you see: I be using the white man\u2019s things sometimes. According to Rev, it\u2019s your fault. Why don\u2019t you people take responsibility for your actions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for my part in this, I am willing to share in some of the blame. I recognize that since my people invented math, science, astronomy and agriculture before your people came over to Africa to study, steal and use it for atomic bomb-making, genocide and ravaging the earth, I am partially responsible for your salty, fuckboy tears of sorrow.\n\nI apologize.\n\nThe two recent articles on Boyce Watkins stirred up a lot of controversy about a lot of things. Two things, in particular, made their way to the mailbag. The first is from some of Watkins\u2019 adherents:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past year, I have come to understand a valuable truth about myself and one of my greatest weaknesses. Some may even call it an obsession. It is this:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t stand to see anyone take advantage of black people.\n\nIt makes me genuinely upset, and sometimes in my furor, I attack people. When I berate white people for their participation in white supremacy, some of the people who age like buttermilk left in the back seat of a Buick on a summer day (see ... there I go again) believe that it means I hate all white people. When I call out preachers who use the Bible as a means of spreading white people\u2019s messaging while stuffing their pockets with black people\u2019s hard-earned money, some Jesus worshippers view it as an attack on Christianity.\n\nAnd, yes, when I impugn the characters of people like Umar Johnson and Boyce Watkins for using the plight of black people to enrich themselves by duping people who have fallen prey to their cult of personality, as well as to trade in homophobia, misogyny and transphobia, some see it as an attack on black people, Pan-Africanism and cultural knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am fine with that.\n\nI realize that some white people believe in whiteness like some Christians believe in their pastors, like some black people believe in anyone who feeds them a fetishized bullshit narrative. Those people have faith. I will never change their minds because they believe in the people, not the ideas.\n\nBut I won\u2019t stop trying.\n\nBecause\u2014even when they\u2019re black\u2014those people are using blackness as a way to target my people. Johnson and Watkins are no different from Creflo Dollar or the Democratic Party. They mean us no good. They just want power and money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the entire time I\u2019ve written for The Root, I have never had a white person tell me what I could and couldn\u2019t write. In fact, aside from the directive from my black editors that I couldn\u2019t call Ray Lewis a \u201ccoon\u201d that one time, I have never been told by anyone what I couldn\u2019t say at The Root. No, we are not black-owned. But we are operated and run by black people and use our platform for black people. But I\u2019m sure that when you\u2019re typing your comments on white-owned Facebook\u2019s platform, Mark Zuckerberg sends you a private message telling you what you can and can\u2019t say.\n\nSo while you think you are dissing me for calling out charlatans, con men and people who scream about white supremacy only because they want the opportunity to get rich and control women, gays and transgender people, I actually take it as a compliment.\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nAnd, finally, Boyce Watkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore last week, I had never followed Boyce Watkins and was only marginally aware of him. It was members of the Black Business School who pointed out this story to The Root and gave us the specifics, which means that if he feels attacked, he should confront his own customers.\n\n\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Watkins is upset with The Root. He is pretending to be upset because his stream of revenue has been threatened. Who else is he going to attack\u2014the white guy and Asian guy who called him a \u201ccharacter\u201d whom they use to sell \u201chope and emotion\u201d as a \u201creligion\u201d to black people? They\u2019re his business partners. They created and control the \u201ceducational product\u201d he sells. Except for the email where he called their comments \u201crude and culturally insensitive,\u201d he has not distanced himself from the guys who said publicly, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to educate them.\u201d He remains in bed with people who don\u2019t seem to give a fuck about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during this whole ordeal, I gave Watkins the benefit of the doubt, as did some of the members of his organization who spoke with us. We all believed that he was being duped, too. They figured that he probably had no idea that the medicine he was selling to black people was just a placebo. But now I think differently.\n\nDespite the fact that he has not disproven a single fact in the story and, in fact, confirmed them all, Watkins has defended himself by telling his people that he was not given the opportunity to speak on the record:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is this:\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Feb. 2, four days before this story went live, I sent Watkins an email inviting him to speak on the record. I sent a media request to Watkins\u2019 personal page. I sent him a message on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, he has continued to publicly say that he was not contacted, despite the fact that we posted his company\u2019s entire email response to the article. When he made these public statements, the petty part of me posted screenshots of my attempts to contact him:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly deleted them.\n\nWatkins might not be a con man. He might be serious about helping black people achieve financial freedom. Maybe he believes that working with men who don\u2019t care about black people is the only way he can achieve his goals. But there is one thing you can be sure of:\n\n\n\nBoyce Watkins is a liar.", "keywords": ["mans", "clapback", "roots", "white", "watkins", "fact", "rev", "im", "way", "dont", "mailbag", "apology", "black", "using"], "polarity": 0.02524870962370963, "subjectivity": 0.4430071086321085},

Greenbow\n\nSubject: Your hate for white women I am numb to your treatment of white women because you want to throw stones at them so much that people don\u2019t pay attention to it anymore. What bothers me it when you keep pushing the narrative that 53% of white women voted for Trump. That is not the case. 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. Most white women did not vote for him because only a small porecetage one the population votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is another comment from a reader named \u201cGet some Dak Sausage,\u201d who posted about it multiple times in a post that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, white women or even politics. They complained about Senior Editor Stephen Crockett\u2019s use of the stat in several comments:\n\nYes. I\u2019m saying that factually roughly 25% of white women voted for Trump. That\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m not talking about how complicit everyone feels the roughly half of white women that didn\u2019t vote are.\n\nDear L and Get:\n\nI apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. When I wrote that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, I made a mistake. In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck. He\u2019s no hero. Can\u2019t wait for the files to come out about your scumbag hero. He was a complete degenerate. Get woke about MLK, clown shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dees,\n\nYou win. You have the title.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this to others before, but you get the championship trophy as the most racist white person ever. I\u2019ve seen hate before, but ... damn. It\u2019s not even about how anyone could despise someone who fought for freedom or equality. I can even understand why you believe the bullshit put out by J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, whose stated goal was to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. What both shocks and intrigues me about your hate is this:\n\nY\u2019all already killed him.\n\nAnd you\u2019re still mad?\n\nEnjoy your trophy.\n\nThis next two are basically the same statement on the supremacy of white men. The first is a Twitter direct message and the next is an email.\n\n\n\nFrom: Joseph B. I DISAGREE WITH MICHAEL HARRIOT OF THE ROOT TOTALLY WHEN HE SAYS WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK\u2014 HE HAS DUMBED EVERTHING DOWN TO HIS MENTALLITY. THE STATISTICS HE CITES ARE OK FOR WHITES BUT THEY COULD BE TEN TIMES BETTER. WHITESCARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD JUST FOR BEING WHITE. PEOPLE JUST CANNOT HANDLE ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITES IN EVERY FIELD AND THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. WHITES ARE GETTING RAPED AND KILLED BY NON WHITES IN FAR GREATER RATES THAN VISA VERSA. THE WHITE CHRIATIAN IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD. JESUS PREDICTED THIS WHEN HE SAID \u201cTHEY HATED ME AND THEY WILL HATE AND PERCECUTE YOU.\u201d ISLAM IS A GARBAGE SICK VILE RELIGION THAT HONORS A MURDERER AND PEDOPHILE MOHAMMED. THEY ATTACK WHITE CHRISTIANS JUST FOR BEING WHITE CHRISTIANS; FOR NO OTHER REASON. INVTHIS COUNTRY A WHITE CANNOT WALKBINCA BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD OERIOD. THEY WILL BE UNDER ATTACK AND ROBBED RAPED OR MURDERED QUICKEY; I MYSELF HAVE BEEN BEATEN TO A RAW BLOODY PULP BY BLACKS IN BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN I TRIED TO VISIT BLACK FRIENDS. TJEY BEAT ME UP JYST BECAUSE IM WHITE AND BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER EVER EVER WIN A DEBATE WITH ME. THE TRUTH WILL SET EVERYONE FREE. HOW IS IT RACIST FOR A WHITE PERSON TO WANT TO PRESERVE WHITE CHRISTIAN CULTURE THAT BUILT THE WHITE COUNTRIES AND THE USA AND CANADA ? LOOKCAT HAITI\u2014 IT HAS BEEN BLACK RULED FOR 200 YEARS AND IS A TOTAL VIOLENT CEESPOOL. NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE THERE. LOOK AT THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD MOVE THERE. THE PEOPLE ARE. DEMON POSSESSED. RACIST KILLERS OF WHITE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. OH NO ?? TRY TO WALK AROUND IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY AFTER DARK\u2014 YOU WILL BE EXECUTED FAST. YOU SAY NO ?? DREAM AWAY CHILD. DREAM ON. I BELIEVE THAT GOD MADE ALL PEOPLE FROM ONE BLOID C AS HE SAYS IN THE BIBLE\u2014 BUT PAGAN BACKWARD BELIEFS DETROY PEOPLE AND BLACK AFRICA IS LIADED WITH BACKWARD PAGANISM\u2014 NEVER SAYING WHITES ARE PERFECT\u2014 NO RACE IS, BUT WHITES AREAS WHETE WHITES LIVE ARE MYCH SAFER TO ALL RACES . PEOPLE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS THEY CREATE AND NOT BLAME OTHER RACES FOR THEIR FAILURES. THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET. I HOPE THEY DO SOME DAY. EVERYONE NEEDS TO DO THEIR PART IN HELPING HUMANITY . BUT THUS FAR ONLY THE WHITE COUNTRIES ARE GENEROUS AND KNOW THE WAY OF GIVE NOT GET.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Adolph Crackerjack\n\nSubject: The difference between white men and everyone else White men live their lives. They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["whites", "say", "men", "clapback", "horribles", "roots", "know", "white", "women", "im", "trump", "mailbag", "voted", "black", "basket"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

I examine them for white tears, anger and racism and formulate a response in my head. Then I look at my computer and say:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that shit in the morning.\u201d\n\nYes, I am a \u201clate motherfucker.\u201d\n\nI am one of the precious few people who have been endowed with the special gift of never being on time. I am always late. Late motherfuckers don\u2019t enjoy being late. Instead, we have a disability that prevents us from being on time, unlike some people who wake up at the crack of dawn and start working diligently. (I won\u2019t mention any names. Let\u2019s just say she might be a deputy managing editor at The Root.) I honestly think I should get disability and one of those parking decals so I can park up front and rush in.\n\nMy late-motherfucker-ness came in handy today because this was a slow week for hate mail. Then, at the last minute, it flooded in like white tears at a Black Lives Matter rally. I say all of this to ask a favor of the haters:\n\nCan you be a little more prompt?\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: For the record, I was up at 4 a.m. today and waited hours for this post ... because Negroes are always late. I thank my Irish side for never being a late Negro. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example of how being a late motherfucker works, our first item is a comment from JC-Sean, who took umbrage with me calling Post Malone a \u201ccultural appropriator\u201d in a post from a few hours ago.\n\n\u201cCultural appropriation\u201d is the very definition of hypocrisy. Our society is a mixing pot of culture, meaning everyone from every background takes some aspects of another previous society and implements them to their needs. I needn\u2019t list off the dozens of things white culture has created that black culture has taken advantage of. If Post doesn\u2019t want to be known as a rapper and simply as a musician, who are you to question him? If society relies on pure feelings as it is, then what makes his claim unjustified in comparison?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear JC-Sean:\n\nI was all set to clap back at your white nonsense about cultural appropriation. It was going to be good, too. I was going to write how you, like many others who present this ignorant argument, have no idea what cultural appropriation actually means. I was going to explain to you like you are 5 years old how cultural appropriation has nothing to do with taking \u201caspects of another previous society\u201d and using them for one\u2019s needs.\n\nDamn, JC, I was going to roast your ass for being so dumb that you think using an art form, invention or technique created by another culture is \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d My best line was going to be, \u201cNigga, I\u2019m not accusing every motherfucker who uses fire or a wheel of stealing from Cro-Magnon man!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I was going to rip apart your kindergarten-slow-class-like logic by explaining that there is a difference between Eminem immersing himself in a culture, respecting it and contributing to the art form and Post Malone using the art form to make millions while simultaneously saying: \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with those niggers. I\u2019m a musician, not a rapper.\u201d Then I was going to explain how he gets to dabble in the stereotype of hip-hop while enjoying the privilege of not having to deal with the consequences.\n\nMy only problem was, I needed an analogy to illustrate my argument. If only there were some incident that could show how Malone\u2019s whiteness means that he isn\u2019t treated like the black artists he emulates with his Caucasian step-and-fetch-it-ery. I desperately needed a way to prove that Malone gets to enjoy the societal privilege of being white and pocket the money from his pseudo-black stereotype. I must admit, JC, that I was stuck.\n\nAnd then this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that is Post Malone, on video in Las Vegas, the recent site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, riding around with a machine gun mounted atop a truck.\n\nPost Malone is not in jail.\n\nPost Malone is still alive.\n\nShut the fuck up, JC.\n\nOur next clapback comes from an accident:\n\n\n\nYesterday, while searching for something on the internet, Producer Danielle Young discovered that there is a whole section of YouTube devoted to black conservatives clapping back at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are two of my favorites:\n\nAnd this dude, who calls himself \u201cUncle Hotep\u201d and spends a lot of time attacking black people in videos:\n\nI must be honest: I thoroughly enjoyed these niggas, in the same way people enjoy watching Bumfights and Jackass. I actually subscribed to their channels after watching a few of their videos because I sometimes need to remind myself what the opposite of \u201cself-aware\u201d is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext week, no one will be talking about the Erykah Badu article or that wig-wearing mop bucket who called April Ryan out of her name, and I can use these videos to help me become a better person. I\u2019m just going to scroll through them every now and then, and if I ever hear any of them say anything and think to myself, \u201cYou know, that guy makes a lot of sense,\u201d then I\u2019ll know what to do next:\n\nSlit my motherfucking throat.\n\nThe next clapback comes via an email written by a reader who disagreed with the article disparaging the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: DJ\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Thanks You\u2019re a racist but you\u2019re right that democrats aren\u2019t friends of struggling communities. They love poverty. They keep people addicted to crumbs without teaching/promoting how to be independently successful and self reliant. They love when writers like you promulgate victim hood because it keeps people victims. When the black Fordham law professor wtites an article saying black people are disabled(link below), they cheer. If a person is disabled or a victim, they need help. So yeah, they\u2019ll keep giving those crumbs to the victims....in exchange for votes. They won\u2019t tell the victims they can succeed through hard work and making good decisions.(see Asian and black immigrants) Then they wouldn\u2019t need the Democrat\u2019s loving help. It\u2019s ethereal whiteness that\u2019s holding people back. Hmm, something that can\u2019t be quantified so can never be proven to be ended. That\u2019s the perfect boogeyman to keep people addicted to oppression. Maybe this is your wakeup call. I hope you\u2019re not as stupid as you are racist. Sincerely, Dj\n\nDearest Dj:\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to thank you for recognizing both my stupidity and my racism and agreeing with me that the Democratic Party is trash. When I saw your link from the Fordham professor, I also agreed with you that it is a stupid idea to equate being black with being disabled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I read the article from the link you sent from that bullshit right-wing site and the original article from Kimani Paul-Emile, who is an associate professor of law and director of Fordham University\u2019s Center on Race, Law, and Justice. After reading all of this, I sympathized with you because I quickly realized that one of my theories is correct:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nI realized this because Paul-Emile specifically wrote, \u201cBlackness, of course, is not, by itself, an impairment.\u201d Then I realized, after noting that the article explains that she is using the concept of disability law because \u201cit accurately reflects what Black, as a racial designation, is and was designed to be: disabling. Racial categories were created explicitly to serve as a caste system to privilege some and disadvantage others ... ,\u201d that you probably didn\u2019t read that part, because it is in the first sentence!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what white people like you will do.\n\nYou plant the seeds of racism in every square inch of fertile soil, and when the poisonous flowers bloom, you wonder why we\u2019re sick. You accuse people of acting like victims because they\u2019re allergic to hate.\n\nI have seen the rape, oppression, torture, thievery and hate you spread around the world. You are a scourge of humanity, Dj. You are a monster. No one is afraid of \u201cboogeymen.\u201d But to quote Kevin Spacey from the great documentary The Usual Suspects:\n\n\u201cThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis second greatest?\n\nCreating Dj.", "keywords": ["art", "lastminute", "clapback", "roots", "late", "white", "cultural", "malone", "appropriation", "article", "post", "mailbag", "black", "going", "culture"], "polarity": 0.027621882086167802, "subjectivity": 0.4252031368102795},

In fact, \u2018are\u2019, not \u2018might be\u2019, given your willingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019. Why are you attacking white people, hon? Hypocrisy really escapes you, lol? Because YOU are projecting your own racist tendencies onto anyone who rejects your embarrassingly puerile and morally and intellectually dishonest narrative. But, hey, sweets, keep it up...you are doing a fabulous job of confirming that pompously moralizing social justice warriors are nothing but self-parodying attention seekers who repel even moderate liberals. Grow up, how embarrassing for you to publicly advertise your salivating junior high mean girl malice and ignorance.\n\nFrom: Meh1234 Oh noes! Oh noes! Not the flag! Nooooooooooooo. And OMG, you made an article about it! That means you, not just support it, but actively encourage it! Yeah, grow a pair; whichever ones you prefer. And she\u2019s right, btw. If you aren\u2019t bleeding, no bones are sticking out & you can breathe, STOP crying. It\u2019s easy to blame \u201cwhites\u201d for your issues, and it\u2019s hard to actually acknowledge that your problems are created by you. The day 13% of population stops committing 50% of crimes, is the day less shooting by cops against that 13% of population will occur. Kinda like magic, really. Nothing racist about it - we\u2019re, as humans; black, white, asian, doesn\u2019t matter really, as long we don\u2019t subscribe to marxist bullshit you do - tired of your whining. The whole world is tired of your whining. Guess what? Others were \u201coppressed\u201d as well, Ottoman\u2019s Empire in Balcans was a thing for 400+ years - longer than slavery in US - and you don\u2019t hear those people whining about their ancestors and how they are owed the world, do you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Blkk, runningnoodles and Meh1234,\n\nLook, I agree with all of you. Yesha is an oppressive racist. She makes me write that intro every week and she just asked me, \u201cWhere is the mailbag?\u201d The only reason she keeps doing this to me must be racism. #MikeLivesMatter.\n\n[It\u2019s 2:45 p.m. on Friday. I am ready to eat my edibles and drink some wine, yet here I am editing this. You are the oppressive one. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Blkk is right: If Keaton\u2019s mom supported \u201cthe racist BLM,\u201d Yesha would be cool with that because ... duhhh\u2014I never thought that Yesha was against white people. She even told me herself. She said to me, \u201cI have nothing against the alabasters.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I\u2019m pretty close. I had no reason not to believe her, but after reading your comments, I\u2019m beginning to suspect something is up with Yesha.\n\nI agree with runningnoodle\u2019s contention that Yesha\u2019s \u201cwillingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019\u201d is a little bit prejudiced. Yesha reached that spurious conclusion simply because she often sees the Ku Klux Klan waving the rebel flag during marches and skinheads proudly wearing it on their uniform. She refuses to factor in the possibility that people may use it to represent their heritage. Sure, it\u2019s a heritage of people who were willing to die so that slavery could endure, but why base her opinion on facts?\n\nThe man who designed the Confederate flag said that they were \u201cfighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause,\u201d but that is just another one of those \u201cfacts\u201d that Yesha factored in when she wrote about Keaton\u2019s mom. Facts are racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when Meh1234 included the \u201cfact\u201d that police shoot black people because 13 percent of the population commits 50 percent of crimes, Meh1234 leaves out the fact that a large percentage of those crimes are drug-related arrests, and even though whites use drugs at about the same rate, blacks are 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for them. But who\u2019s counting? Obviously not Meh1234.\n\nI just want to confirm with all of you that I have notified the proper authorities and warned them that they should keep an eye on Yesha\u2019s black identity extremism. After they laughed me off the phone, I decided to keep a dossier myself. I\u2019m updating it every day, since no one else will.\n\nDespite the fact that Yesha has never killed a black boy in cold blood and walked away scot-free; even though she has never denied anyone employment or housing because of their race; in spite of the fact that she didn\u2019t create an unequal education, political or criminal-justice system, the fact that she wrote about a white woman who is willing to take handouts on the internet while vilifying black people just because it\u2019s actually her job to do that is no excuse. Yesha and her highfalutin words are the real racists. I see it now. Thanks, guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for Yesha sullying innocent little Keaton, you are absolutely correct. Just because his mother is a racist and his father is a white supremacist doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Keaton will ... wait. Scratch that last point. I was about to use facts.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching her.\n\n[Also, I\u2019m not racist. I have white friends. I\u2019ve provided photographic evidence below.

Black kids graduate high school. Black mothers graduate college and get married before you pop out 3 kids with 3 different men before you are 25. Black people are their own worst enemy. You are a pussy!! South Carolina , what a joke and yes us northerners make fun of people taking pics of snow dusting. What a clown!! Your nostrils stretch out to the center of your eyes. Not natural!! Plantation nigger, no doubt. That is right motherfucker, we never owned slaves. Totally different generation. A bunch of excuse makers who blame others for their races dysfunctions. Facts do not care about feelings asshole. You called Trump a racist but Obama gets a pass for having Al Sharpton as a close adviser and invited BLM to the White House. The double fucking standards. Black home ownership is the highest it has ever been under Trump. Keep drinking that Kool Aid.. Black people from the south might be the dumbest people ever. Simple mineed fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo hours later, when he received no response, he sent this:\n\nEqual rights comes with equal responsibility to respect the rights of those who do not agree with you. Guess who said that asshole. MLK!! Funny that Donald Trump did business in NYC for 40 years and he received awards from the NAACP and other groups and even Jesse Jackson praised his work on behalf of minorities, but he suddenly became a racist when he ran for president and sheep like you fall for it hook, line and sinker. It is like black people cant think with their ,and need the fake media to think for them. You are a sheep!!! So damn easily led.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear George,\n\nYou win. Your letter is unclapbackatable. You\u2019re right. Black fathers need to stop playing sperm donors. Black people need to get an education before having children. President Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House. I don\u2019t have a mirror in front of me right now, but my nose might actually stretch to the center of my eyes.\n\nYou are correct. By your definition of racism, neither you nor Donald Trump is a racist. You win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Kevin G\n\nTo: The Root I have been reading Jalopnik and Gizmodo for years. Recently your other articles from Kinja assets have been showing titles linking to racist articles. \u201c10 types of useless white people\u201d \u201cWhite people need to be better people\u201d And many more. I know you don\u2019t care about my opinion as a white person, but if the race of these articles were switched to any other race, YOUR teams would be shouting racism. I\u2019m sure you do this to get clicks and views, but I will no longer read anything published by your media company and it\u2019s support of racism. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nNo, Kevin!\n\nDon\u2019t go. I\u2019m begging you. Please stay. On behalf of all of the employees at The Root, I\u2019d like to offer my sincerest apologies. I had no idea we were assaulting your delicate sensibilities with our anti-white commentary. Trust me, we are ashamed of ourselves. In our Wednesday staff meeting, we often worry about the content of our site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live with constant concern about the flimsiness of the one-ply, Dollar Tree toilet-paper thickness of white skin. But now we understand the one thing we overlooked and the reason we have received so many complaints:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nCaucasian illiteracy is a growing problem in America that The Root has vowed to eliminate. After seeing the grammar and spelling in our hate mail, we realize these aren\u2019t isolated incidents; it\u2019s a national crisis equal only to the opioid epidemic, Chicago gun violence and when retail employees don\u2019t listen to a white woman who was obviously \u201ctold by AppleCare ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we understand that Caucasians can\u2019t quite read the posts we write about homophobia in the black community, crime and misogyny. Now we fully see that when we criticize women like Tomi Lahren, Taylor Swift and former Officer Betty Shelby, we\u2019re being racist. But when we condemn people like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele or Arizona Police Officer Philip \u201cMitch\u201d Brailsford, who shot Daniel Shaver in cold blood, apparently white people can\u2019t read those articles.\n\nWhen we called out Ray Rice for his anti-anthem stance, Lil Wayne for his anti-Black Lives Matter comments, Migos for homophobia, Steve Harvey for joking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, Sheriff David Clarke for the murders in his prison or Ben Carson for his support of Donald Trump, our fairer-skinned brethren didn\u2019t quite have the requisite level of reading comprehension to enjoy those pieces. When I wrote about the culture of black male silence surrounding sexual assault, I should have done it phonetically. And apparently, Damon Young\u2019s viral piece \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d was too filled with words for our white audience.\n\nWe\u2019re going to change this, Kevin. Not just for you but for all of our white audience that accuses us of racism. I know you must be correct in your assessment of The Root because if not, it could only mean that you are being willfully ignorant and would rather call us racists than admit that there is a possibility that you pay attention only to things that confirm your own biases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019d never do that, Kevin.\n\nI just want you to stay. We\u2019ll do better, Kevin. I promise. Don\u2019t leave us. We are going to miss your one or two page views per week. We might have to close up shop. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m being sarcastic or facetious. I care about you.

As a councilwoman from the Mar\u00e9 favela, she denounced the police brutality that favela residents, most of them black, regularly experienced.\n\nOn Wednesday around 9:20 p.m., armed men gunned the councilwoman down in her car in the center of Rio de Janeiro with nine shots\u2014four to the head. Her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, also died. She had just left an event that she organized about black women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\n\nHer death touched so many people that supporters organized vigils and protests in more than 20 cities across Brazil. Most of these protests were against the genocide of black people in Brazil. For Afro-Brazilians, Franco proved that a black person from a favela could be educated, have dignity and also fight against the social injustice that black Brazilians suffer from every day. For women, she proved that they could overcome sexism and machismo in Brazil. But her death is hitting Afro-Brazilian women, who suffer the most from Brazil\u2019s violent, racist and sexist society, the hardest.\n\n\u201cShe died because she was a combative black woman,\u201d said Lua Nascimento, an Afro-Brazilian college classmate of Franco\u2019s who attended a protest on her behalf in Salvador, Brazil. \u201cShe was executed because she was a black favela dweller who fought against the murder of black favela dwellers. The genocide of the black population continues in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of people gathered in front of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s council chambers to pay homage to Franco, who was buried Thursday night. To show their digital support for her, Brazilians are changing their Facebook profile photos to those of Franco and using the hashtag #MariellePresente, which translates to \u201cMarielle is here.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International, the longtime leader of a campaign against the genocide of black people in Brazil, demanded that her death be rigorously investigated. With those nine shots, Franco became one more statistic in this genocide. Just over 50 percent of Brazil\u2019s population of 200 million is black. But blacks account for 2 out of every 3 murders. They are also overrepresented in favelas where violence and murder of blacks by police are rampant. Last year, the Rio de Janeiro police force killed more than 1,000 people. Black women in Brazil also disproportionately suffer violence\u2014a recent study revealed that young black women are twice as likely to suffer from murder as their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September of 2016, Franco received the fifth-most votes\u2014more than 46,500\u2014to became a councilwoman representing the liberal Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) in Rio de Janeiro. Her win was remarkable because she grew up in Mar\u00e9, one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest and most dangerous favelas.\n\nFranco was the only black female representative and one of seven women on the 51-seat council. During her campaign, which was branded with the feminist color of purple, she spoke openly of her favela beginnings and introduced 50 ideas to help women, Afro-Brazilians and favela dwellers. She maintained her campaign promise to help these populations, served as the president of the House Committee on Women and led a committee that monitored Rio de Janeiro\u2019s military intervention.\n\nPhoto: Kiratiana Freelon\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen she became a councilwoman, she continued to radically fight for the black population who suffer extermination in this country,\u201d said Maria Angela, vice president of the PSOL political party in Minas Gerais. \u201cShe never forgot that she was a black woman from the favela. She didn\u2019t align herself with politicians who opposed her values and the population that she represented.\u201d\n\nIt is widely believed that her death is connected to her stance against police violence. Four days before her murder, Franco publicly called a police battalion unit known for its brutality the \u201cmurder unit\u201d and accused it of physically harassing people in a particular favela. The day before her death, she used her Twitter account to acknowledge the death of a young man who was killed by the police as he was leaving a church in a favela.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslated to English, the tweet reads, \u201cAnother death of a young man at the hands of the police. Matheus Melo was leaving church. How many more need to die for this war to end?\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhat is happening in Acari is absurd! It\u2019s always been happening! The 41st battalion of the military police is known as the battalion of death. This is the beating of the population. This is the killing of our young people!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlavia Oliveira, a respected black columnist for Globo\u2019s newspaper, described the gunshots inflicted upon Franco as shots against the skin of the black woman, the favela dweller, the sociologist, the defender of human rights, the elected representative.\n\n\n\n\u201cMarielle was a black woman who worked on behalf of the community. Instead of selfishly caring for her own life, her daughter and her companion, she wanted to improve a society that is as unequal as it was violent,\u201d wrote Oliveira in a column entitled, \u201cMultiple murders in just one.\u201d\n\n\n\nNascimento, still visually shaken from Franco\u2019s death, remembered that Franco decided to pursue human rights because she lost her best friend to gun violence in the favela. \u201cShe managed to unite people across class and race boundaries while still staying true to her work on behalf of people in favelas,\u201d Nascimento said. \u201cWe are talking about a brilliant black woman, who represented so many people. But this is what Brazil does. The people who are progressive in Brazil are not respected and they are killed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarielle leaves behind a partner and a teenage daughter.\n\n\n\nIn the hours before her murder, Franco participated in a roundtable discussion with 30 other black women.

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

The city she lived in and schools she attended were mostly white. But when she moved to Campinas, a city of 1 million approximately two hours outside of Sao Paulo, she decided to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI wanted to increase my connection to Afro-Brazilian people,\u201d she says.\n\nThaisa joined Afrodengo, an Afro-Brazilian dating community on Facebook. When she finally got up the nerve to post her photo and introduced herself\u2014a requirement of the community\u2014she noticed that one guy who \u201cliked\u201d her photo lived in her city. His name was Jackson Xavier.\n\nShe reached out to him on Facebook and they immediately started talking. Two days later, they went out on their first date. She instantly liked his intelligence, responsibility and the way he cared for her. He liked her stubbornness, humor and intelligence as well. Five months later, the couple were married. As Jackson explains:\n\nBefore the group, I didn\u2019t even think to look for relationships with black women, and I had never had a black girlfriend. But once I entered the group, I started to focus more on having a relationship with a black person like me because we have similar experiences. The black movement is very strong on the internet, so I entered the group wanting to see more beautiful black people and to have references in my life to black things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrodengo was created one year ago by Afro-Brazilian journalist and single mother Lorena If\u00e9, 29, to promote love and marriage among Afro-Brazilians. \u201cDengo\u201d is a word with African roots that Brazilians\u2014especially Afro-Brazilians\u2014call people to show love and care. Despite the country\u2019s African origins, hundreds of years of slavery and European colonialism have made affection and stable relationships between black women and black men in Brazil unique and unusual.\n\nNow Afro-Brazilians are flocking to the Afrodengo Facebook group to build relationships that they never before considered having. But If\u00e9 not only wants to spark love among Afro-Brazilians; she also wants to help them build relationships with one another so that they can combat racism in Brazil. She explains:\n\nHaving relationships between black people is a way to combat racism. Only a black person will know how racism affects you and its consequences in our lives. In a society where we learn to hate ourselves, if we unite with people like us, then we can combat racism with something as simple as having a conscious family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo jump-start the group, If\u00e9 invited Afro-Brazilian men and women to post photos and descriptions of themselves. Within a week, it exploded\u2014with both members and photos. At one point, If\u00e9 had more than 10,000 people waiting to be approved to the group. If\u00e9 created an environment where every type of black person, regardless of sexuality, sex, religion or political viewpoint, is welcome.\n\nToday the group is still going strong; having produced at least two marriages and countless couples and friendships. There are more than 100,000 members in the main group and its affiliates (which focus on LGBT members, Christians and body positivity). If\u00e9 plans to turn the Facebook group into an app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Afro-Brazilians enjoy the group, some white Brazilians consider If\u00e9 and the group racist because it is exclusively for black people. For African Americans, a dating site for black people seems obvious. But for Brazilians, communities restricted by race are always frowned upon. White Brazilians also want to be a part of the group.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I have to deny entrance to white people who want to join the group,\u201d If\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Afrodengo stems from If\u00e9\u2019s personal experiences pursuing amor afrocentrado\u2014\u201dblack love\u201d\u2014 in Salvador, Brazil. While in a relationship with her son\u2019s father, she felt that their relationship lacked the affection she sees given to white women in Brazil. Soon after they broke up, she tried her hand at online dating and even created a profile on Tinder. But although she lives in a city that is more than 80 percent black, she couldn\u2019t find any black men on the platform.\n\nIf\u00e9 says she wasn\u2019t raised with affection\u2014which is common among poor Afro-Brazilians simply trying to survive. Personally, she longs for a black man who will cherish her intelligence and give her affection when she wants\u2014even when she doesn\u2019t need it. She still longs for an \u201cAfrodengo.\u201d\n\nCreating this Afrodengo [was] a way to help me survive and help others going through a similar situation. It helped me to move on from my relationship and survive my depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9\u2019s struggle is one that many black women in Brazil share. Many of their lives are marked by loneliness (solid\u00e3o da Mulher Negra) because they aren\u2019t chosen\u2014the chosen women being white women. In Brazil, black and mixed-race women have been traditionally oversexualized or looked upon as domestic servants, while white women are viewed as the perfect women to give affection to and to have a healthy marriage with. It is a given that the more money and education an Afro-Brazilian has, the more likely he will marry a white woman.\n\nTranslating from a YouTube video by anthropologist Ana Cl\u00e1udia Pacheco, a professor at the State University of Bahia:\n\nBecause of historical reasons related to racism, many black women in Brazil suffer from solitude. ... Our choices in who we give affection to and who we choose as a partner are still regulated by and structured by racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Afrodengo isn\u2019t just for creating romantic relationships; Afro-Brazilian men and women are using the group to strengthen their black identity and create friendships with Afro-Brazilians across Brazil. Says early adopter Gabriel Rangel, 25, from Rio de Janeiro:\n\nI still haven\u2019t found a relationship through Afrodengo, but now I have friends all over the country, and the group has really opened my mind to the Black Movement in Brazil.\n\nMember Lais Mello entered the group one week after it launched. Adopted by a white family, she\u2019d lacked a strong connection to Afro-Brazilian culture. She created the first city-specific WhatsApp group for Afrodengo, which helped her organize meetups in Salvador and make friends with Afro-Brazilians close to her town in Bahia. Now Mello is a moderator of the group, and credits Afrodengo with increasing her self-esteem and pulling her out of depression:\n\nBefore Afrodengo, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because of my depression and anxiety. My self-esteem was so low. But now I love going to Afrodengo meetups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9 has grand plans for the Afrodengo brand. The first thing she wants to do is get off of Facebook and create an app for the group. She\u2019s currently looking for funding and support, and plans to apply to the Vale de Dend\u00ea accelerator, which is targeting Afro-Brazilian startups based in Salvador.", "keywords": ["easier", "afrobrazilians", "relationships", "women", "white", "afrobrazilian", "style", "group", "if\u00e9", "love", "afrodengo", "black", "making", "brazil"], "polarity": 0.10571208112874778, "subjectivity": 0.43239417989417983},

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["simply", "glamour", "look", "know", "shadow", "glow", "getty", "oscars", "palette", "stunning", "zendaya", "night", "eye", "hair", "served"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

It also gave us an outlet that wasn\u2019t limited to, \u201cCan you believe what this motherfucker just wrote me?\u201d But now that we\u2019ve been doing this for a few months, I\u2019ve realized something:\n\nRacists aren\u2019t very original.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t mean to upset the hardworking racist community out there by disparaging their work ethic. I would, in no way, demean you by besmirching the sheer volume of work put in every day by the people whose hearts are filled with what I imagine to be terrible things like black jellybeans, the crotches of Donald Trump\u2019s post-golf tighty-whities and the rag used to clean Harvey Weinstein\u2019s house plant.\n\nThe problem is that along with being not very smart, racism gets boring after a while. It\u2019s not that I am no longer offended\u2014I never really get mad at people calling me \u201cnigger\u201d anonymously; it\u2019s just that I\u2019m no longer entertained. Maybe I have become numb to racism, and every form of it has now become banal. Maybe I\u2019m just jaded like an EMT who can scrape brains off the concrete after a car wreck while eating a peanut butter and Jelly sandwich.\n\nIn any case, I\u2019m calling for all you racists out there to inject some thought, originality or at least some common sense into your correspondence. If not, we run the risk of excluding you from the mailbag totally, and no one wants that. The only other solution is, maybe you guys will stop being racist and ...\n\nNah, that\u2019ll never work.\n\nOur first correspondence concerns an article about an Air Force sergeant who went on a racist rant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Gary\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Feedback. ..airforce sergeant under investigation for racist rant How in the hell is this racist? All she said was \u201cblack\u201d...last I checked, saying \u201cblack females \u201c is not a racial slur. Talking about getting over sensitive and over reacting. So unless you\u2019re kissing black people ass, you\u2019re a racist. Thats bullshit. I\u2019ve also ran into quite a few black people with attitude in my life,as have I ran into alot of white people with attitude. ..no difference. ..attitude is attitude. Race dont mean shit when it comes to attitude. But since shes not black...then shes a racist?? Pfft. Ok,then...good luck with that. How about Mr. Chi from SNL... he called Trump a \u201ccracker\u201d tell me, why in the hell is that NOT racist? Cracker IS a racial slur when referring to whites. How about all the blacks that call each other \u201cnigger\u201d...if black people say it, its NOT racist, but anyone else... they\u2019re racist. Fuckin double standard in this country is getting WAAAAAY out of hand. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Is it racist...or \u201ca term of endearment\u201d as Kanye West once said? Make up your minds. Either way...for a black person to call a white person \u201ccracker\u201d or \u201cwonderbread\u201d or any of the other slurs they use, thats racist and makes them fucking Hypocrites too. If we all truely want to end racism, we need to stop getting our pants in a bunch over every little thing that has the slightest possibility of being racist, as well as holding EVERYONE, regardless of race, to the SAME standards. Just an opinion Thank you for your time\n\nHey, Gary:\n\nThere\u2019s a thing you need to know about racism: I don\u2019t say this to be combative. I genuinely hope that you will share it with your friends at the rallies and cross burnings:\n\nNo one gives a fuck what your white ass thinks about racism.\n\nStop thinking you get to decide or have a voice in anything about the subject. White people thinking they get to define racism is the same thing as a person who is accused of sexual assault climbing on the witness stand and presenting this legal defense:\n\n\u201cBut it was just date rape, right? I mean ... she\u2019s given consent to other men, so why should she be so mad at what I did? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Gary, I know you\u2019re dumb, so I\u2019m going to explain to you how white supremacy works:\n\nThe woman in this particular article is an officer in the armed forces\u2014an organization that has a strict hierarchy. She also holds an innate prejudice against black women, as do many others. In her world, her feelings are so uncontroversial and widespread that she was comfortable enough to share them on the internet.\n\nI presume that the airwoman, as a member of the Air Force, will be promoted multiple times. She will undoubtedly have women of color under her command. Those women\u2019s careers and lives will depend on a woman who not only doesn\u2019t give a fuck about them but also lives in a world that confirms her prejudices. Those black women under her command won\u2019t have the same opportunities as a white man or a white woman under the same command\u2014even if the black women are as smart, talented and hardworking as their white counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe she won\u2019t have a long career in the military. Maybe she\u2019ll get out and do one of the jobs most popular with military vets, like becoming a teacher or working in human resources or\u2014better yet\u2014law enforcement. I\u2019m sure her racism won\u2019t matter in those places.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nHere\u2019s another way that it works: A man with the IQ of a three-toed sloth could watch that racist rant and say to himself: \u201cHow in the hell is this racist? In fact, I think I\u2019m going to fire off a sternly worded email about this! And while I\u2019m at it ... why can\u2019t I say nigger?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a direct message from Twitter user Free Radical:\n\nHello Mike! I figure I\u2019ll get right to the point: I\u2019m a sheltered white person (Spokane is white as fuck and I\u2019m an isolated nerd) who has a question, but I\u2019m worried it might be racist to ask. For starters, I know that black people are not a monolith, and I can easily see how the very notion of \u2018asking black people\u2019 could be racist. Still, the question lingers in my head. It\u2019s probably not an original question, but Google has failed me a bit in finding a comprehensive discussion of the subject. I love The Root. I love that it challenges a lot of my notions, and I\u2019m very much a fan of your work, and you\u2019re the first person I thought of that might be able to point me in a direction in which I could educate myself. My question/issue is this: I\u2019ve been listening to \u2018To Pimp a Butterfly\u2019 a lot lately, and the more I listen to it, the more I\u2019m moved by it and the more I fall in love with it. I like to post songs and lyrics on my Facebook page and share them with my friends, and I want to share this album and these songs with my friends. My question pertains to using \u2018the n-word\u2019 when quoting black artists. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to infringe on black ownership of the word. On the other, I don\u2019t want to censor the artist\u2019s work when I\u2019m sharing it. I don\u2019t want to be one of these assholes who goes \u2018hey, if they use it, I can use it,\u2019 so I\u2019m at a bit of an internal impasse. Anyway, do you know of any big articles or videos discussing this specific subject (i.e. quoting lyrics)? Either way, thank you for your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Free:\n\nFirst, I want you to know that I honestly appreciate your question. I say this with no sarcasm intended. I think your heart is in the right place and I hope you will continue to read and learn from The Root. Here is your answer:\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nIntentional or not, your quandary is the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. You are not actively seeking to oppress or demean anyone. In fact, it seems as if you want to do the opposite. But the notion that you are even searching for the answer to this indicates that you mean no harm, but also illustrates how you get to live in a world where you get to raise this question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not accusing you of being a racist, and you seem to want an honest opinion. As a white person in America, you might not be as familiar with this concept as I and many other people of color are, but there is something you need to know:\n\nThere are some things you cannot do, simply because of the color of your skin. Most white people never learn this. Almost every black person has learned this lesson.\n\nYou. Cannot. Use. The. Word. Nigger.\n\nFull stop.\n\nI know, I know. It doesn\u2019t seem fair. But you must think of it this way:\n\nAt worst, you will have to suffer through the horrible possibility that you may have to wade through life under the oppression of never being able to post a Kendrick Lamar lyric on your Facebook page, with the only upside being that you have not inadvertently dredged up the history of lynching, slavery and white supremacy for the simple purpose of showing your internet friends how you totally relate to your favorite rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, on the plus side, you get to keep all your teeth!\n\nFrom: God Bless All Men & Women\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Prayers from white boy I pray that Jesus enters your heart and breaks the stone off of it that He loves all races as should we all. Saying all whites are this or all blacks are this is the same damn thing dont stoop to that level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear God:\n\nIs that too informal? Should I call you Mr. or Ms. Women? Imma just stick with \u201cGod\u201d because I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re friends, being that you so lovingly reached out to me and you\u2019re praying for me and everything. After all, you love me. Shouldn\u2019t friends be on a first-name basis?\n\nWhen I refer to you as God, I hope it doesn\u2019t come off as blasphemous, as I do not mean to insinuate that I am talking to the God. I mean, even if I believed in her, I wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d be stupid and illiterate. I\u2019d know that the true and living God wouldn\u2019t just make shit up because she was feeling so injured by the words that one of the lowly creatures that she created wrote on the internet. I\u2019d know that any God who even insinuated such a thing was a false God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what I\u2019d tell that God? I\u2019d say: \u201cStop making shit up, you lying-ass motherfucker!\u201d I\u2019d tell that bullshit God who you just made up in an email to criticize me and make yourself feel good to show me where I said \u201call.\u201d \u201cShow me!\u201d I\u2019d say.\n\nYou know what that stone-heart-breaking Jesus God of yours would do? She\u2019d admit she was wrong and apologize. And then your made-up God and I would keep talking, and I\u2019d ask why, if she loves \u201call races\u201d so much like the email writer says, then why is the floor of the Atlantic Ocean littered with skeletons of black people thrown from slave ships? Why are we always the ones mopping up blood in Audubon Ballrooms or picking up bits of brain and bone on Memphis, Tenn., motel balconies? Were they not praying loud enough when Dylann Roof plopped down on that Charleston, S.C., church pew?\n\nI appreciate your thoughts and prayers, and I do not want to slander or attack any religion ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut your God obviously hates me, and I ain\u2019t letting that motherfucker nowhere near my heart.", "keywords": ["step", "jesus", "racist", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "god", "im", "dont", "racists", "person", "thing", "id", "mailbag", "game", "black", "need"], "polarity": 0.017008326732902996, "subjectivity": 0.48562764291577837},

Monique Judge for the record, Black Men have consistently explained the Gay Agenda, and if you like we can have a discussion about it. You and the other coon, Michael Harriot at root.com need to fall back from attacking Confident heterosexual Black Men. Before you call me a Hotep, save it for the person that fit the description. I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot.

In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck.

You have the title.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this to others before, but you get the championship trophy as the most racist white person ever. I\u2019ve seen hate before, but ... damn. It\u2019s not even about how anyone could despise someone who fought for freedom or equality. I can even understand why you believe the bullshit put out by J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, whose stated goal was to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. What both shocks and intrigues me about your hate is this:\n\nY\u2019all already killed him.\n\nAnd you\u2019re still mad?\n\nEnjoy your trophy.\n\nThis next two are basically the same statement on the supremacy of white men. The first is a Twitter direct message and the next is an email.\n\n\n\nFrom: Joseph B.

PEOPLE JUST CANNOT HANDLE ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITES IN EVERY FIELD AND THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. WHITES ARE GETTING RAPED AND KILLED BY NON WHITES IN FAR GREATER RATES THAN VISA VERSA. THE WHITE CHRIATIAN IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD.

PEOPLE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS THEY CREATE AND NOT BLAME OTHER RACES FOR THEIR FAILURES. THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET. I HOPE THEY DO SOME DAY. EVERYONE NEEDS TO DO THEIR PART IN HELPING HUMANITY . BUT THUS FAR ONLY THE WHITE COUNTRIES ARE GENEROUS AND KNOW THE WAY OF GIVE NOT GET.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Adolph Crackerjack\n\nSubject: The difference between white men and everyone else White men live their lives. They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["whites", "say", "men", "clapback", "horribles", "roots", "know", "white", "women", "im", "trump", "mailbag", "voted", "black", "basket"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

I\u2019ve been asked that question a million times (I\u2019m bad at math). But I thought we should take some time to explore this question.\n\nIt might give our readers some insight into why we choose to jab back at those who send us hate mail, insulting tweets and ugly comments. It might help you understand why The Root started this weekly tradition. But mostly because Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan makes me write these introductions every week [Hey, Harriot, I see you talking about me because I\u2019m editing this. Introductions are important! \u2014Yesha].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, a bully named Jamaal was about to beat up one of my friends when Jamaal tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass. Scared, I ran home and hid in the house. My mother saw the fear in my eyes, and do you know what she did? She grabbed me by my collar and said: \u201cAight. I mean ... Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal. That\u2019s when I realized: A smart, witty retort is even better than kicking someone\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, that story is 100 percent fake. The following emails are 100 percent real. Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["hate", "point", "wypipo", "clapback", "thats", "roots", "women", "white", "article", "tripping", "jamaal", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "important"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

It wasn\u2019t until I was 30 years old and I had already experienced so much racism, read tons of books and looked at myself within, that I finally recognized myself as a black woman,\u201d said Almeida, who is a hairstylist.\n\nAnd Almeida wanted to communicate her identity to the world.\n\n\u201cWhen I started to see myself as a black woman, I started looking for aesthetic elements that helped me to form this identity,\u201d she said.\n\nShe discovered turbantes, \u201chead wraps\u201d in Portuguese, and for the last few years she has been wearing turbantes to complement her hair and ethnicity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Brazil, wearing head wraps is an expression of Afro-Brazilian culture, history and religion. Enslaved Africans brought the tradition from their homelands, and enslaved Afro-Brazilian women continued the tradition by using turbantes during their religious practices or simply to protect their hair. Today, young Afro-Brazilian women are embracing turbantes as an opportunity to assert their blackness in a country where white supremacy rules.\n\nTha\u00eds Muniz, a native of Salvador, Brazil, teaches Afro-Brazilian women how to wear turbantes through her company and brand Turbante.se, which means to \u201chead wrap yourself.\u201d But her lessons aren\u2019t limited to the aesthetics of head wraps. She also focuses on the unique history and politics of head wraps in Brazil, a country where more than 50 percent of the population identifies as black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I first started researching head wraps years ago, I couldn\u2019t find anything on the internet about Afro-Brazilian women,\u201d said Muniz, who is based in Dublin but is from Salvador, Brazil.\n\nNow she travels across Brazil doing turbante workshops, showing young Afro-Brazilian women how to wear turbantes. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have more than 60,000 followers combined.\n\n\u201cRight now, young black women in Brazil aren\u2019t wearing turbantes for religious purposes or just aesthetic purposes,\u201d Muniz said at a recent workshop in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of resistance. It\u2019s a new symbol that we have created of our roots.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of turbantes by Afro-Brazilian women goes back to the era of slavery. According to Muniz, the Yoruba people from what is now modern-day Nigeria and Benin were some of the last Africans to be brought to Brazil. Their Yoruba religion led to the creation of the Afro-Brazilians\u2019 Candombl\u00e9 religion, in which women and men wear turbantes on their heads as a form of protection.\n\nOutside of religion, while white women often wore jeweled hats, enslaved black women all over Brazil wore turbantes to carry heavy baskets on their heads and cover their short hair or shaved heads. Eventually, their use as a fashion accessory in the public declined\u2014black women only wore them while cleaning. The turbante became identified with Baianas de Acarajae, women in Salvador who sell acarajae and sweets on the streets, wearing the clothes they would wear to a Candombl\u00e9 ceremony\u2014a white robe and turbante and, sometimes, jewelry. Carmen Miranda, a white Brazilian woman of Portuguese origins, popularized the style of these black women in the 1940s with the song \u201cO que \u00e9 que tem a Baiana tem\u201d (\u201cWhat Does the Baiana Have?\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople look at me and say that I look like Carmen Miranda, which is insulting,\u201d Muniz said. \u201cWhy would someone look at a black woman and associate her with a white woman who romanticized the situation of black women who were enslaved, exploited and sexually abused?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contemporary valorization of turbantes as a political statement has its roots in Salvador, the blackest city in Brazil. In the \u201970s, Salvador\u2019s Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea carnival group took the turbante in a direction Brazilians had never seen before: The Afro Bloco, created in response to the exclusion of blacks in Salvador\u2019s carnival, combined black pride with fashion, with the turbante as the centerpiece.\n\nDete Lima, one of the female founders of the Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea group, created the signature look of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and continues to work as a stylist for the group. As she told a Brazilian newspaper (translated from Portuguese):\n\n\n\nI learned when I was a child to be conscious that I am black and I have to do my part as a militant and uplift my people, my roots and everything related to my history. We are black and we are beautiful ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer contemporary Negra Jh\u00f4 was one of the first black women to wear turbantes in the streets of Salvador back in the \u201970s. From there, she started teaching people how to create elaborate turbantes and hairstyles using braids. Negra Jh\u00f4\u2019s beauty salon in the center of Salvador is an aesthetic reference for Afro-Brazilian women across the country.\n\nAfro-Brazilian women aren\u2019t the only ones embracing turbantes. Their white Brazilian counterparts are, too\u2014and it\u2019s not being received well. In the last few years, Brazilian media and fashion have taken to featuring white women in turbantes, diluting the political statement in favor of a fashion statement. Last year, a white cancer survivor admitted on Facebook that she was being criticized by black women for wearing turbantes. The post was shared more than 38,000 times and sparked the hashtag #VaiTerBrancaDeTurbanteSim, which translates to, \u201cYes, white people will wear head wraps.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Afro-Brazilian women, this is a form of cultural appropriation. When black women wear turbantes, they are often discriminated against in stores, on the streets, even at university. Shortly after the #VaiTerBrancaDeTurbanteSim hashtag took off, Dandara Tonantzin Castro suffered harassment from several men when she wore her turbante at a university graduation. In a Facebook post titled \u201cOur Presence Makes Them Uncomfortable,\u201d Castro described how a young man pulled at her turbante.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Thais Muniz, rather than restrict white people from wearing turbantes, it\u2019s more important that people understand the history and meaning of turbantes for Afro-Brazilians. But as she told The Glow Up, she understands the discrepancy in the respect that white women receive when they wear turbantes: \u201cWhenever you have a white body dressed in a turbante alongside a black body, the white person will always be the one valued more.\u201d", "keywords": ["head", "history", "reemergence", "brazilian", "women", "white", "afrobrazilian", "woman", "political", "turbante", "fashion", "statement", "deeply", "turbantes", "black", "wear", "brazil"], "polarity": 0.03785922912428938, "subjectivity": 0.34405935430031837},

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["hiphop", "beautiful", "natural", "blige", "unmaking", "lawrence", "hairstylist", "talks", "florence", "j", "netflix", "mudbound", "queen", "davis", "mary", "soul", "hair"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

I honestly think I should get disability and one of those parking decals so I can park up front and rush in.\n\nMy late-motherfucker-ness came in handy today because this was a slow week for hate mail.

Our society is a mixing pot of culture, meaning everyone from every background takes some aspects of another previous society and implements them to their needs. I needn\u2019t list off the dozens of things white culture has created that black culture has taken advantage of. If Post doesn\u2019t want to be known as a rapper and simply as a musician, who are you to question him? If society relies on pure feelings as it is, then what makes his claim unjustified in comparison?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear JC-Sean:\n\nI was all set to clap back at your white nonsense about cultural appropriation. It was going to be good, too. I was going to write how you, like many others who present this ignorant argument, have no idea what cultural appropriation actually means. I was going to explain to you like you are 5 years old how cultural appropriation has nothing to do with taking \u201caspects of another previous society\u201d and using them for one\u2019s needs.\n\nDamn, JC, I was going to roast your ass for being so dumb that you think using an art form, invention or technique created by another culture is \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d My best line was going to be, \u201cNigga, I\u2019m not accusing every motherfucker who uses fire or a wheel of stealing from Cro-Magnon man!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen I was going to rip apart your kindergarten-slow-class-like logic by explaining that there is a difference between Eminem immersing himself in a culture, respecting it and contributing to the art form and Post Malone using the art form to make millions while simultaneously saying: \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with those niggers. I\u2019m a musician, not a rapper.\u201d Then I was going to explain how he gets to dabble in the stereotype of hip-hop while enjoying the privilege of not having to deal with the consequences.\n\nMy only problem was, I needed an analogy to illustrate my argument. If only there were some incident that could show how Malone\u2019s whiteness means that he isn\u2019t treated like the black artists he emulates with his Caucasian step-and-fetch-it-ery. I desperately needed a way to prove that Malone gets to enjoy the societal privilege of being white and pocket the money from his pseudo-black stereotype. I must admit, JC, that I was stuck.\n\nAnd then this happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, that is Post Malone, on video in Las Vegas, the recent site of one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, riding around with a machine gun mounted atop a truck.\n\nPost Malone is not in jail.\n\nPost Malone is still alive.\n\nShut the fuck up, JC.\n\nOur next clapback comes from an accident:\n\n\n\nYesterday, while searching for something on the internet, Producer Danielle Young discovered that there is a whole section of YouTube devoted to black conservatives clapping back at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are two of my favorites:\n\nAnd this dude, who calls himself \u201cUncle Hotep\u201d and spends a lot of time attacking black people in videos:\n\nI must be honest: I thoroughly enjoyed these niggas, in the same way people enjoy watching Bumfights and Jackass.

When the black Fordham law professor wtites an article saying black people are disabled(link below), they cheer. If a person is disabled or a victim, they need help. So yeah, they\u2019ll keep giving those crumbs to the victims....in exchange for votes. They won\u2019t tell the victims they can succeed through hard work and making good decisions.(see Asian and black immigrants) Then they wouldn\u2019t need the Democrat\u2019s loving help. It\u2019s ethereal whiteness that\u2019s holding people back. Hmm, something that can\u2019t be quantified so can never be proven to be ended.

After reading all of this, I sympathized with you because I quickly realized that one of my theories is correct:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nI realized this because Paul-Emile specifically wrote, \u201cBlackness, of course, is not, by itself, an impairment.\u201d Then I realized, after noting that the article explains that she is using the concept of disability law because \u201cit accurately reflects what Black, as a racial designation, is and was designed to be: disabling. Racial categories were created explicitly to serve as a caste system to privilege some and disadvantage others ... ,\u201d that you probably didn\u2019t read that part, because it is in the first sentence!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what white people like you will do.\n\nYou plant the seeds of racism in every square inch of fertile soil, and when the poisonous flowers bloom, you wonder why we\u2019re sick. You accuse people of acting like victims because they\u2019re allergic to hate.\n\nI have seen the rape, oppression, torture, thievery and hate you spread around the world.

How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "blacks", "white", "im", "root", "sure", "mailbag", "butthurt", "black", "ok", "wrote"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

Monique Judge for the record, Black Men have consistently explained the Gay Agenda, and if you like we can have a discussion about it. You and the other coon, Michael Harriot at root.com need to fall back from attacking Confident heterosexual Black Men. Before you call me a Hotep, save it for the person that fit the description. I am a Humanistic Atheist, I don\u2019t give a damn about any form of religion or Spirituality or the dumb Woke shit. The Gay Agenda is just as real as your hate for confident heterosexual Black Men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear IsAllah Self-Kingdom,\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to congratulate you. Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["saying", "evil", "job", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "blacks", "way", "welfare", "mailbags", "think", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

For his part, Felix said he had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. News of the Moscow real estate deal came to light this week after democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a status report outlining dozens of leads they say they could not pursue after the republicans shut down the committee\u2019s investigation, according to Business Insider.\n\nHere is a rundown of how Sater was pursuing the Moscow deal, per Business Insider:\n\nSater and Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were pushing for the deal with VTB in Moscow at the height of the presidential election, in late 2015 and early 2016. The revelation will likely draw sharp scrutiny from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Sater first sent a non-binding letter of intent to Cohen outlining the terms of the \u201cTrump World Tower Moscow\u201d deal on October 13, 2015, The New York Times previously reported. Andrey Rozov, a Russian investor, had already signed it by the time Sater forwarded it to Cohen, and Trump signed the letter. Weeks later, the two men exchanged a series of emails gearing up to celebrate the Trump Tower Moscow deal. In the emails, obtained by The Times, Sater bragged about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Cohen he would \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on the deal. \u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater wrote, according to The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides being a Trump associate, Sater spent the past two decades as a top US intelligence asset for the DIA, CIA and the FBI. He even claims to have pursued high-level terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden.\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he has been interviewed by Mueller. But it is very likely that Mueller is well aware of Sater\u2019s intelligence work because he was the FBI Director during much of the time he was working for the feds.", "keywords": ["moscow", "russian", "sanctioned", "pursued", "mueller", "election", "tower", "bank", "felix", "cohen", "trump", "vtb", "organization", "sater", "claims", "deal", "likely"], "polarity": 0.06828567055839785, "subjectivity": 0.35109974200883287},

Like a mother preparing her home for 500,000 tourists, Rio has swept the city's poverty under the rug by increasing police and army presence in favelas. As a result, part of the local population isn\u2019t that anxious about the games. Militarized police presence and violence are only some of the issues that have affected the Afro-Brazilian population living in Rio since the possibility of sports mega events such as the World Cup in 2014, and now the Olympic Games, became a reality in Brazil.\n\n\"Urban segregation in Rio de Janeiro was aggravated with the preparation to receive the sports mega events,\" anthropologist Luciane O. Rocha, a researcher at the Nucleo de Estudos da Cidadania Conflito e Viol\u00eancia Urbana of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, told The Root. \"While the investments in housing and the majority of the spatial structure for the games were constructed in privileged areas, to the poorest areas were destined only violent actions from the policy and the army.\"\n\nSince 2014, the black population of Rio has complained that the government has been increasing police presence in favela communities, which aggravates an already problematic issue of violence between the poor and the police. Also, in 2014, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s former governor Sergio Cabral requested the presence of military forces in the state to help pacify favela communities. More than 20,000 military officers are reported to be part of the security force for the Olympics. But it isn't just the increased police presence that has many concerned; racial profiling of poor black youths inside the public transportation has also increased, and some have reportedly been denied access to wealthy neighborhoods close to beach areas.\n\nIn August 2015, Secretariat of Security Jos\u00e9 Mariano Beltrame decided to control gang-related robberies in beach areas by requesting that the military police approach poor black youths and demand to see their documents, even removing them from buses while they were trying to go to the beach.\n\n\u201cThe media put the population against the youth that only wanted go to the beach, when we had almost 90-degree [days],\" actor and journalist Ernesto Xavier said. \"They were arresting the minors and left them [the] whole day in a police station with no food or water, releasing them only at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs tension grew between the poor and the police, the number of black deaths increased. In 2015 more than 480 black men were killed by the police in Rio. One of the victims of the over-policing of favelas was 30-year-old Vitor Santiago. On Feb. 11, 2015, Santiago and some friends were returning to the Complexo da Mar\u00e9, a group of favela communities in Rio's north side, after watching a soccer team play when the army, which was patrolling the area, reportedly opened fire on the car they were riding in. The car was hit with 762 bullets.\n\nSantiago would suffer a punctured lung and have his leg amputated. The damage done to his bone marrow after the shooting rendered Santiago a paraplegic.\n\n\"I have a lot of needs; I can\u2019t work anymore because someone needs to take care of my son,\" Santiago's mother, Irone Santiago, said. \"Everything the government promised to me didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t have home care, the diapers that my son is using were a donation from people in the community. I\u2019m still waiting on a neurosurgeon to evaluate my son.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIrone Santiago claims that the government called the shooting a \"mistake\" and notes that she has yet to receive any financial support from the state, the federal government or the army.\n\nFor many black residents like VItor Santiago, Brazil's Olympic legacy will be more about violence and exclusion, since the games don't feel welcoming to those who live in the poor parts of the city.\n\n\"Olympics for whom?\" Irone Santiago asks. \"These games are made with the blood of our sons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniela Gomes, who is from Sao Paulo, is a Ph.D. candidate in African and African Diaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin and a journalist.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

Remember I loved you all!*\n\n* (Unless Yesha\u2019s reading this.)\n\nThis first item is meant to address one of the most frequent complaints received by The Root. I have been emailed by numerous white women arguing the same point, which is the most white-womanish point ever:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom L. Greenbow\n\nSubject: Your hate for white women I am numb to your treatment of white women because you want to throw stones at them so much that people don\u2019t pay attention to it anymore. What bothers me it when you keep pushing the narrative that 53% of white women voted for Trump. That is not the case. 53% of white women voters voted for Trump. Most white women did not vote for him because only a small porecetage one the population votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here is another comment from a reader named \u201cGet some Dak Sausage,\u201d who posted about it multiple times in a post that had nothing to do with Donald Trump, white women or even politics. They complained about Senior Editor Stephen Crockett\u2019s use of the stat in several comments:\n\nYes. I\u2019m saying that factually roughly 25% of white women voted for Trump. That\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m not talking about how complicit everyone feels the roughly half of white women that didn\u2019t vote are.\n\nDear L and Get:\n\nI apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. When I wrote that 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, I made a mistake. In my haste to be accurate and fair, I may have sullied the good name of the Caucasian sheroes who historically get to benefit from the conquering, colonizing white supremacist manifest destiny embedded in their male counterparts without bloodying their hands or mussing their silky blond hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI meant \u201cwhite women.\u201d\n\nI know that white women enjoy an unparalleled entitlement gifted to them at birth that follows them around for their entire lives. It\u2019s not even their fault. It\u2019s society\u2019s fault. White women are the shit. Even a balloon-shaped Becky gets to be a trophy for\u2014if no one else\u2014a self-hating black man. Our last two first ladies have been an Ivy League-educated attorney and a plain-old skinny, generic, white mail-order bride Trump got from eBay. White women have it made.\n\nBut even though they don\u2019t have to adhere to the rules of society, they at least have to acknowledge the existence of the motherfucking language. The language of politics and democracy doesn\u2019t genuflect simply because you have an oatmeal-colored vagina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I say, \u201cThe Atlanta Falcons blew a 23-point lead in the Super Bowl,\u201d the players who didn\u2019t get in the game never email me saying: \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that.\u201d When Trump says he was \u201celected by the American people,\u201d he doesn\u2019t parse it by saying, \u201cThe less-than-half who voted for me.\u201d When people say Barack Obama \u201cwon the black vote,\u201d Omarosa, Ben Carson, and Diamond and Silk didn\u2019t raise their hands to object. That\u2019s not how teams work. That\u2019s not how democracy works. That\u2019s not how anything else works.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let\u2019s say I agreed with your premise. Doesn\u2019t that make white women more complicit? Who should I absolve? The white women who would have voted for Hillary Clinton but stayed their asses home?\n\nWhite people voted for Trump. White women voted for Trump. You should be glad Stephen and I say \u201c53 percent of white women\u201d instead of calling them by the name I suggested:\n\n\u201cThose blood-sucking, privileged-assed, low-key-racist white heauxs.\u201d\n\nFrom: Dees Nuts\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: MLK to Black people The only White people MLK did not hate were the underage prostitute whores he would beat and torture fuck. He\u2019s no hero. Can\u2019t wait for the files to come out about your scumbag hero. He was a complete degenerate. Get woke about MLK, clown shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dees,\n\nYou win. You have the title.\n\nI know I\u2019ve said this to others before, but you get the championship trophy as the most racist white person ever. I\u2019ve seen hate before, but ... damn. It\u2019s not even about how anyone could despise someone who fought for freedom or equality. I can even understand why you believe the bullshit put out by J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI, whose stated goal was to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. What both shocks and intrigues me about your hate is this:\n\nY\u2019all already killed him.\n\nAnd you\u2019re still mad?\n\nEnjoy your trophy.\n\nThis next two are basically the same statement on the supremacy of white men. The first is a Twitter direct message and the next is an email.\n\n\n\nFrom: Joseph B. I DISAGREE WITH MICHAEL HARRIOT OF THE ROOT TOTALLY WHEN HE SAYS WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK\u2014 HE HAS DUMBED EVERTHING DOWN TO HIS MENTALLITY. THE STATISTICS HE CITES ARE OK FOR WHITES BUT THEY COULD BE TEN TIMES BETTER. WHITESCARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD JUST FOR BEING WHITE. PEOPLE JUST CANNOT HANDLE ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHITES IN EVERY FIELD AND THE WORLD IS EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. WHITES ARE GETTING RAPED AND KILLED BY NON WHITES IN FAR GREATER RATES THAN VISA VERSA. THE WHITE CHRIATIAN IS UNDER ATTACK BY THE WHOLE WORLD. JESUS PREDICTED THIS WHEN HE SAID \u201cTHEY HATED ME AND THEY WILL HATE AND PERCECUTE YOU.\u201d ISLAM IS A GARBAGE SICK VILE RELIGION THAT HONORS A MURDERER AND PEDOPHILE MOHAMMED. THEY ATTACK WHITE CHRISTIANS JUST FOR BEING WHITE CHRISTIANS; FOR NO OTHER REASON. INVTHIS COUNTRY A WHITE CANNOT WALKBINCA BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD OERIOD. THEY WILL BE UNDER ATTACK AND ROBBED RAPED OR MURDERED QUICKEY; I MYSELF HAVE BEEN BEATEN TO A RAW BLOODY PULP BY BLACKS IN BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS WHEN I TRIED TO VISIT BLACK FRIENDS. TJEY BEAT ME UP JYST BECAUSE IM WHITE AND BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER EVER EVER WIN A DEBATE WITH ME. THE TRUTH WILL SET EVERYONE FREE. HOW IS IT RACIST FOR A WHITE PERSON TO WANT TO PRESERVE WHITE CHRISTIAN CULTURE THAT BUILT THE WHITE COUNTRIES AND THE USA AND CANADA ? LOOKCAT HAITI\u2014 IT HAS BEEN BLACK RULED FOR 200 YEARS AND IS A TOTAL VIOLENT CEESPOOL. NO ONE WANTS TO LIVE THERE. LOOK AT THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD MOVE THERE. THE PEOPLE ARE. DEMON POSSESSED. RACIST KILLERS OF WHITE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. OH NO ?? TRY TO WALK AROUND IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY AFTER DARK\u2014 YOU WILL BE EXECUTED FAST. YOU SAY NO ?? DREAM AWAY CHILD. DREAM ON. I BELIEVE THAT GOD MADE ALL PEOPLE FROM ONE BLOID C AS HE SAYS IN THE BIBLE\u2014 BUT PAGAN BACKWARD BELIEFS DETROY PEOPLE AND BLACK AFRICA IS LIADED WITH BACKWARD PAGANISM\u2014 NEVER SAYING WHITES ARE PERFECT\u2014 NO RACE IS, BUT WHITES AREAS WHETE WHITES LIVE ARE MYCH SAFER TO ALL RACES . PEOPLE MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS THEY CREATE AND NOT BLAME OTHER RACES FOR THEIR FAILURES. THE WHITE RACE HAS LITERALKY SAVED OVER ONE BILLUON LIVES BY THE HIGH TECH MEDICINE THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH GAVED SAVED SO MANY LUVES. THINK OF ALL THE MILLUONS OF DOSES OF LUFE SAVING MEDICINES WHITES HAVE GIVEN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SAVED HUNDREDSVOF MILLIONSOF LIVES. I REPEAT. NON WHITE MEN HAVE NOT DONE THIS YET. I HOPE THEY DO SOME DAY. EVERYONE NEEDS TO DO THEIR PART IN HELPING HUMANITY . BUT THUS FAR ONLY THE WHITE COUNTRIES ARE GENEROUS AND KNOW THE WAY OF GIVE NOT GET.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this:\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nFrom: Adolph Crackerjack\n\nSubject: The difference between white men and everyone else White men live their lives. They go about their business, and for the most part never consider their race. To a white man he is merely another human. I certainty never though much about race until I got tired of my people being denigrated at every turn. White people are the only race of people taught to hate and disrespect their own ancestors and history. But women, all women see life through the lens of being a women not a human. For black people everything centers around being black. Gays and lesbians build their entire existence around the fact they are homosexual. Muslims are completely consumed by Islam. Meanwhile, the white man is a blank slate navigating life based on logic and experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, the difference between white men and and everyone else is this:\n\nYou believe you get to control the world.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You think you can rape, kill, pillage, steal, colonize and enslave at your will. It is in your DNA. You are the scourge of the earth. You tortured my ancestors, raped Africa, committed genocide against the Jews, Native Americans, Haitians, every island in the Caribbean, the Aztecs, the Inca, the Aborigine and every native population on earth. You are the destruction of the planet. If the devil has a face, he is a white man. You will one day pay for your misdeeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just kidding.\n\nI know you two letter writers didn\u2019t do any of that, just like I know Joseph hasn\u2019t invented anything in his life. He doesn\u2019t even have the technical literacy to find the \u201ccaps lock\u201d key, so I know he\u2019s not creating anything in his garage, unless you count meth. I don\u2019t.\n\nMy point is that Joseph and Adolph don\u2019t get to live by two sets of rules. They don\u2019t get to enjoy the privilege of individuality by dissociating themselves from Nazis, domestic terrorists and white supremacists and then castigate others by lumping all other groups into a basket based on stereotypes. So I say this to all white people:\n\nPick one.\n\nEven though I am an educated black man with an IQ high enough to hit the \u201cshift\u201d key, I\u2019m fine with you thinking I might be a stupid gangbanger or a criminal. But if we are going to play that game, you have to admit your personal responsibility for every \u201cshithole\u201d around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I am to be a thug, then you have to admit that you are Adolf Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan. If an individual Muslim should automatically be assumed to be a terrorist, then I should assume that all white men are the same as the scum who dragged Emmett Till out of bed or slaughtered billions of babies around the world to make way for white rule.\n\nI\u2019m not accusing you, or any white person, of anything. I\u2019m just saying: If we are going to play the game, pick a set of rules so that I can know which game we are playing.\n\nAnd for God\u2019s sake, hit the goddamn \u201ccaps lock\u201d key!", "keywords": ["whites", "say", "men", "clapback", "horribles", "roots", "know", "white", "women", "im", "trump", "mailbag", "voted", "black", "basket"], "polarity": 0.0025409052312605736, "subjectivity": 0.3439361794437936},

This lede was gonna be funny as hell, too. I was going to explain how this week\u2019s collection of emails, tweets and direct messages were all about politics and how people insert their political assumptions into whatever they read. This sentence was supposed to make a hilarious comparison about how every presidential candidate I\u2019ve ever voted for was also the one least likely to make me throw up if I saw them naked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut because of Yesha\u2019s incessant, racist harassment of me and my below-average typing skills, y\u2019all will miss out. You deserve better than this, but you only have Yesha to blame. Anyway, since I don\u2019t have time to craft a funny lede for the mailbag, Here\u2019s some mail.\n\nIt\u2019s a half day! I\u2019m not working beyond 10 a.m. So what a half-day means 1 p.m.? \u2014Yesha\n\nMerry Christmas, motherfuckers.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a fan of both Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party concerning the article about Doug Jones:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Starr C.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Who sent you? Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ... I\u2019m the one playing \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.", "keywords": ["identity", "insert", "clapback", "roots", "politics", "white", "women", "vote", "title", "wasnt", "told", "clever", "bernie", "mailbag", "voted", "black"], "polarity": 0.0626698244677697, "subjectivity": 0.450799465628233},

Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "blacks", "white", "im", "root", "sure", "mailbag", "butthurt", "black", "ok", "wrote"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

I think someone slipped a headache into my drink last night at The Root 100 gala. It\u2019s either a hangover or I have sudden-onset brain cancer. That\u2019s not a thing, is it?\n\nOr maybe it was Social Media Editor Corey Townsend screaming the lyrics to Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d at me. Can I call the police? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a hate crime. Or terrorism. Or white supremacy.\n\nAnyway, there are many people who doubt the veracity of some of the mailbag letters because they apparently don\u2019t think people could be so shitty in real life. There are some who think the hate letters, emails and tweets we receive are from people who are trolling because they want to be featured in the mailbag. Some people even think we fabricate the letters and this whole \u201cmailbag\u201d thing is a ruse.\n\nNah, nigga. This shit is real.\n\nIn fact, this week, instead of hate mail, let\u2019s just look at some actual comments from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an actual comment \u201cMadril\u201d left on a story about a caf\u00e9 that refused to give candy to black kids on Halloween:\n\nSome of you will take this the wrong way because AA or Black Americans have been conditioned to be the victim in America. It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["say", "clapback", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "gray", "madril", "shit", "im", "black", "area", "think", "mailbag", "dont"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

Since I\u2019ve been a full-time employee at The Root, we have been arguing about the Hotepest name ever, and you win hands down. While I\u2019m sure you are a fine, upstanding citizen, your name has obviously done a nine-year bid in prison, where it converted to Islam. I bet your name wears a kufi, refers to pork as \u201cswine\u201d and fucks heavyset white girls on the low. I bet your real name is something like Parker Willoughby.\n\nSetting aside the Hotepery that is your name, I want to offer my sincerest condolences, because I know your secret:\n\nYou have a tiny penis, don\u2019t you, IsAllah?\n\nDon\u2019t be ashamed. It happens. That\u2019s probably why you don\u2019t believe in God, and I don\u2019t blame you. What kind of god would allow his people to be tortured and oppressed for 400 years and then give one of his children a pinkie-toe-sized penis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though I don\u2019t know you, I know men like you. I know men who boast about being \u201cconfident black men,\u201d but in real life, they suffer from the perpetual anger of erectile dysfunction because they can\u2019t get a spoonful of blood to flow into their thimblelike phallus. I recognized your inadequacy because your attitude resembles that of a very stupid white supremacist who claims to be \u201cthe least racist person\u201d we\u2019ll ever meet. He claims to be very smart and says he went to the best schools. I won\u2019t embarrass him by calling his name, except to say that he is a \u201cvery stable genius,\u201d just like you are a \u201cconfident, heterosexual black man\u201d who doesn\u2019t believe in God or religion but calls himself \u201cIsAllah.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, Monique Judge was giggling at guys who talk about the \u201cgay agenda.\u201d Trust me, I don\u2019t giggle. The white man makes us believe that giggling is masculine, but I overstand because I use my fourth eye. Not my third eye, because the number 3 is a relic of Christian slavery from the Holy Trinity, the three wise men and the three blind mice. (Also, my third eye is what I call my penis.)\n\nApparently, you and others live in constant fear that \u201chomosexuals\u201d have a secret plan that could convince you to eat swine and engage in same-sex shenanigans. Don\u2019t fall prey to the gay agenda. I can tell you are a weak-minded individual worried about the prospect that acknowledging the humanity of people whose love looks different from yours could magically render you semen-thirsty. Resist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStay strong, IsAllah.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA coon.\n\nThe next clapback stems from an article at HuffPost by Dwayne Wong (Omowale) entitled \u201cStop Using Hotep as an Insult.\u201d In it, Wong says:\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, hotep is an ancient Egyptian term that means \u201cto be at peace.\u201d This is why it\u2019s distressing to me when I see people trying to use hotep as an insult\u2014some of the writers at the Root are especially at fault for helping degrade the term hotep. These people either do not know what the term means or they know and are deliberately trying to demean African history and culture. The term has been coming up a lot lately in regards to Umar Johnson. Umar has been in the headlines because he is currently under investigation and faces losing his psychology license. Umar has also been caught up in a feud with Tariq Nasheed, the director of the Hidden Colors series. Damon Young gave this definition of hotep: Over the past decade or so, the working definition of \u201cHotep\u201d has morphed into an all-encompassing term describing a person who\u2019s either a clueless parody of Afrocentricity\u2014think \u201cPreach\u201d from Don\u2019t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\u2014or someone who\u2019s loudly, conspicuously and obnoxiously pro-black but anti-progress. As African people we have been subjected to having our history and culture degraded, distorted, and destroyed for centuries now. The people who have bastardized what hotep means are contributing to that problem. Take Michael Harriot, for example. Harriot is a writer at the Root and he is constantly using his platform there to criticize Umar Johnson. Some of these criticisms have merit, but other times they have gone so far that Harriot himself has had to apologize and admit he was wrong. In his latest article on Umar, Harriot ironically mocks Umar as being a \u201cHotepologist\u201d and miseducator, even though Harriot is operating as a miseducator himself by distorting what the term hotep means. Another article mocks the fight between Umar and Tariq as being \u201cThe Real Husbands of Hotep\u201d. Hotep means to be at peace, so how does that term fit in with the discord that we have seen being displayed between Umar and Tariq. When Umar and Seti had their feud in 2016, another writer at the Root described it as a \u201cHotep Hoedown\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dwayne,\n\nFirst of all, I want to say: You are right.\n\nEven before I read your article, I had been conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a pejorative. I fully recognize the origin and the meaning of the word. As someone who came to The Root partly because of my blog NegusWhoRead [Editor\u2019s note: And because of me. \u2014Yesha], I realize the importance of taking back words that have been used against us. There is only one problem that I have:\n\nWhat will we call Hoteps?\n\nNeither Damon Young, I nor any other writer at The Root created the term \u201cHotep\u201d to describe the overly woke people who engage in misinformation and thievery against the black community. We use the word because people know what it means. But I readily admit that I fell into the trap of lazily throwing it at those who honestly seek liberation by connecting themselves with their ancestral heritage. While I do think that the default deification of everything Egyptian is problematic for a number of reasons, I recognize that \u201cHotep\u201d is a desperate clinging to a history that has been stripped away from our people by a long legacy of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, I promise that I will no longer use it in a derogatory manner. I do not speak for any other writer here, but I\u2019m going to do better. This pledge does, however, lead back to my original problem: What will we call Hoteps? (OK, that was the last time.) I have come up with a list:\n\nWhore-teps\n\n\n\nUmaricans\n\nPoor Tariq-ans\n\nAnkhologist\n\nQuack Lies Matter\n\nWokeheads\n\nNeo Not-Sees\n\nHidden Coloreds\n\nBlacksliders\n\nIsAllah Self Kingdom\n\nHopefully one of those will suffice.\n\nFrom: Justin Other Nigga\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: The Root is anti-black Hey faggot, How much do they pay you to keep bashing black men like Umar? How many people do you mentor? What are you doing for the black community? have you done anything other tna tear black men down? Why do you have so much hate for men like Umar?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Justin,\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nI grew up poor as fuck. Not underprivileged\u2014poor. Nights-without-electricity poor. Days-without-water poor. Cereal-and-water-for-dinner poor. I lived in a very religious household and was homeschooled until I was 12.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first year attending school, I was excited to experience many of the things most people take for granted. I remember how incredibly pumped I was for picture day at school. When that day came, each student was supposed to bring $10 to have his or her picture taken. The night before picture day, my mother informed my sisters and me that she only had $30\u2014not enough for pictures for my three sisters and me. As the only boy in the house, I told her to let my sisters take their pictures. I was heartbroken, but I was over it by the next morning.\n\nThen a miracle happened.\n\nI swear on everything that is good and true that I exited the house on the morning of picture day, and lying on the ground was a $10 bill! I could have taken that money and had my picture taken, but I knew that the reason I couldn\u2019t take pictures was that my mother had to be dead broke. She was in her last week of college and wasn\u2019t working, so I gave her the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was a Friday. The next day at church (we attended church on Saturdays), I watched my mother put $10 in the offering plate. I still believe that my mother put that money in the offering because she thought she was \u201csowing a seed.\u201d That\u2019s how blind, desperate faith works.\n\nAfter service that night, everyone gathered around in the church parking lot to gaze at the pastor\u2019s shiny new car. (It was a shitty Chrysler New Yorker, but to me, it was a might as well have been a Maserati.)\n\nFuck Umar Johnson and all the thieving motherfuckers sucking the souls and money from anyone hoping to sow a seed for black people because we are desperate for something ... anything. I hope they die a fiery death in the depths of hell. I want my foot to be the one that kicks them over the edge. They are worse than white supremacists. I\u2019d rather have a cross on my lawn than a hand in my pocket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root is not making me rich. When I heard about Johnson\u2019s hearing, I was going to go whether The Root sent me or not. I had planned on paying my own way the same as I had done when I went to Ferguson, Mo.; Baltimore; Jena, Texas; and Sanford, Fla. I didn\u2019t ask a black person for a dime to go to any of those places.\n\nYes, I am a hater. I hate con men. The $10 I found on my way to school did as much good for people as the $400,000 raised by Johnson. He has never produced a business plan, budget or shred of evidence that he is starting a school. If he can prove where the money he collected went, I will take back every word I\u2019ve ever said about him. I\u2019ve done it before. I am not happy he is defrauding people who want a school for black boys. I want one, too.\n\nAs long as I have fingers to type and a platform, I will never leave him alone. So call me a faggot. I could care less about what you\u2014wait ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n...

I\u2019ve been asked that question a million times (I\u2019m bad at math). But I thought we should take some time to explore this question.\n\nIt might give our readers some insight into why we choose to jab back at those who send us hate mail, insulting tweets and ugly comments. It might help you understand why The Root started this weekly tradition. But mostly because Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan makes me write these introductions every week [Hey, Harriot, I see you talking about me because I\u2019m editing this. Introductions are important! \u2014Yesha].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, a bully named Jamaal was about to beat up one of my friends when Jamaal tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass. Scared, I ran home and hid in the house. My mother saw the fear in my eyes, and do you know what she did? She grabbed me by my collar and said: \u201cAight. I mean ... Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal. That\u2019s when I realized: A smart, witty retort is even better than kicking someone\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, that story is 100 percent fake. The following emails are 100 percent real. Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["hate", "point", "wypipo", "clapback", "thats", "roots", "women", "white", "article", "tripping", "jamaal", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "important"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

As we close out 2017, we would like to thank our haters because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without you. (Actually, we do know where we\u2019d be without you. We\u2019d be fractionally happier, I\u2019d probably have a better relationship with Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan, and the writers at The Root wouldn\u2019t have a faint sense of dread every time they open an email.)\n\nBut without you, none of this would have been possible.

The racist in chief of this racist blog wrote something racist again! How edgy. Fuck off you racist piece of shit.

Gay\n\nTo: Michael Harriot What If a white person wrote something the 2017 nigger awards you would call them a racist.

Sad.\n\nDearest Iceseller, Mr. or Ms. Gay, and Kodimah:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Iceseller for pre-emptively naming me to the position of \u201cracist in chief,\u201d but as a firm believer in democracy, I cannot, in good conscience, accept the title without a vote of some kind. While your admiration for me is appreciated, there are candidates far more qualified who could serve in this position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the aforementioned Mr. Gay, for instance (I don\u2019t want to gender-profile anyone, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that U.R. Gay is a guy). He seems like a perfect nominee for the position. He said that I am a \u201cworld-class racist,\u201d which means he has apparently traveled the world ranking them. I would think that he would be a better fit to serve as the king of all racists.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to push this conversation forward by pointing out something that seems obvious to me but has obviously flown over the heads of some of our readers. The Root is a publication that covers black America. Racism against black people is a problem in America. We write about it. We are no more obsessed with race than Deadspin is obsessed with sports, The Takeout is obsessed with food, Jalopnik is obsessed with cars or Jezebel is obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It is literally my job to talk about race.\n\nI think Kodimah put it best when he or she said: \u201cImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain what white privilege is:\n\nImagine living in a building with a sniper waiting outside. Imagine that, every day, the sniper shot someone who was exiting your building. Sometimes the sniper was in full sight, and other days the sniper was hidden, but he kept shooting at the people who lived in the building as they walked out.\n\nWhite privilege is the ability to say, \u201cYeah, but people in other buildings get shot, too.\u201d White privilege is the penchant for residents of safer buildings to ask why you don\u2019t just move out of the building. White privilege is being able to say, \u201cYeah, snipers exist, but you can\u2019t worry about them all the time.\u201d But most of all, white privilege is the oblivious idiocy of standing on the sidewalk and asking someone who could be killed by a sniper at any minute, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with snipers?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine reading a piece of satire written by a resident of the building, making fun of snipers. There is only one reason that I can surmise why anyone would be more angry at the person making jokes about snipers than they were at actual snipers:\n\nBecause they are a sniper, too.\n\nKodimah is right.\n\nIt is sad.\n\nFrom: Stephanie\n\nTo: The Root Staff The Root, I\u2019ve been a supporter for a long time. The fact that Skip Gates is a founder spoke to me about your integrity. Lately, I\u2019ve seen way too much cussing and specifically F bombs in your posts.\n\nIt\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s vulgar and common.\n\nIt\u2019s BENEATH you. As professional journalists and editors, if you must cuss to get your point across, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Tired of it,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie, I get your point. I really do.\n\nMy mother is a wise woman and she, too, was a writer. When I was a kid, she forbade us from using vulgar language, including calling someone a \u201cdog,\u201d a \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d She only had two exceptions:\n\nif we were telling a story and the person in the story said the vulgar word or phrase if we could make a logical case why the word was necessary\n\nThose rules are basically the same rules to which we adhere at The Root. I know I have a foul mouth, and I am often asked by the editors and copy editors if a certain word is necessary. Sometimes they change those words without even asking me. I don\u2019t even have a problem with that because I know I can be hyperbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you are a regular reader of The Root, then you know we use a million creative insults, euphemisms and allusions to replace dirty words. I reject the idea that there are \u201cbad words\u201d or that using vulgar language is a sign of a lack of intelligence, and here is why:\n\nSome people are motherfuckers.\n\nThere is a difference between not giving a darn and not giving a fuck. Knocking the crap out of a person is different from slapping the shit out of someone. Sometimes the words you consider to be boorish are the ones that perfectly describe a situation or thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRacism, homophobia, discrimination and Donald Trump are vulgar. Tamping down the description of those things by playing lexical dodgeball with the vocabulary to preserve the pearls that our readers may clutch is not our job.\n\nA few days ago I wrote a story about a Sacramento, Calif., policeman named John Tennis who had a habit of trying to hit black suspects with his car. He shot multiple black people and killed at least two. Even his fellow police officers said that he often discharged his weapon when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Raheem Hosseini of the Sacramento News and Review wrote a puff piece about him that made him into a sympathetic figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could have called them both colostomy bags filled with racism and prejudice. I could have used flowery language to explain how Tennis exemplified the persistent deadly threat posed by men whose uniforms have become a license to cosplay as executioners. I probably could have blistered Hosseini as an entitled equivocator who uses black lives as a stepladder to get closer to the spotlight while using his pen to blot out the bloodstains of the slaughtered innocent. But no ...\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nWhenever we write about Umar Johnson, we get a lot of email from his followers. Here are three:\n\nA direct Twitter message from Kwesi X:\n\nDear sir, I am from overseas and would like to let you know how sick you make me. Why you\u2019ve spent all your time gunning for Dr umar I\u2019ll never know I just want u to answer, How many kids u council? How many people u visited in jail to do free speaking events? Even if u don\u2019t like umar if u really a journalist of credibility you would have presented a balanced article not a I hate umar hit story. You are a fake black owned company that is simply marketed to black people. But your not really helping are you? Just making money on the drama You should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear sirs,\n\nFirst of all, no one who is originally from outside the country says that he is \u201cfrom overseas.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you. You need more Hotep people.\n\nI admit that I am conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a derogatory term because I know the history of the word, but I will also confess that when I was assigned the Umar story, I thought, \u201cHere come the Hoteppers.\u201d I am also tired of writing about Umar Johnson, but I think it is my responsibility. I don\u2019t hate Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cblack consciousness,\u201d any more than I hate the bullshit of prosperity gospel, except for one fact:\n\nHe steals from black people.\n\nLet me be clear:\n\nI believe that black people should know their history. I believe that our connection to our ancestors is important. I believe that there should be a school for black boys with an African-centered education. I desperately hope that someone builds one. I hope there comes a day when there is one in every city and black children can learn how the great Greek philosophers had to go to Africa to get their knowledge, and how the noble, ancient Europeans were bitch-slapped by the Moors and learned agriculture, irrigation, science and astronomy from dark people. One day someone will come with a plan to build and fund this dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that day comes, there will be people who say, \u201cI would donate, but the last time I gave money to something like this, a charlatan who claimed to be a descendant of Frederick Douglass conned me out of my coins.\u201d They will remember how he answered his phone while it was ringing and puffed up his chest whenever anyone asked him to show his Ph.D. People will recall how he publicly preached about the black family while fucking exotic dancers on the low-low. Some will bring up the fact that the last guy who was going to build a school would never show the receipts for how he spent the money.\n\nUmar Johnson\u2019s antics actually make it harder to build this school. If anyone ever achieves the goal of making this a reality, it will be in spite of Umar Johnson, not because of him.\n\nAnd we are not anti-Umar. When everyone doubted Johnson\u2019s degree, it was The Root that spent money to verify his Ph.D. and end the speculation. I am the one who spent days combing through yearbooks and graduation programs hoping that he was legitimate. When I found the evidence, I admitted that I was wrong. In. The. Headline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also the one who has refused to shade him even as I am constantly contacted by people in and outside the \u201cconscious movement\u201d who claim to have personal knowledge that always turns out to be spurious because they have a beef with Johnson.\n\nNo one here hates Umar Johnson.\n\nWe just like the truth.", "keywords": ["cusswords", "sniper", "racist", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "old", "awards", "obsessed", "root", "dont", "friend", "umar", "word", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": -0.019970001889644755, "subjectivity": 0.5327755247398107},

Yes, we\u2019re making it a day of the week. The name \u201cFriday\u201d wasn\u2019t imaginative enough. Plus, it has nothing to do with frying. If they only served fried chicken and french fries, then I\u2019d be cool with the name, but I think the last day before the weekend should be reserved for clapping back.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about how we here at The Root respond to the hateful tweets, emails or comments; I\u2019m talking about you, too. Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week? Send an anonymous note to Sheila in human resources telling her she needs to use better deodorant, if only for the one day you have team meetings. Scream \u201cFuck you\u201d to the mailman who left your packages from Amazon.com in the rain.\n\nLet this be a healing day because the end of the week should be a catharsis so that you can empty out your negative energy and absorb something positive. Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends. Or maybe you can\u2019t because your the one whose the racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg,\n\nFirst of all ... what anti-white jokes? I was being serious. Every single time.\n\nI\u2019m glad you sent this. I have often been accused of being a racist. So often, in fact, that I decided to be proactive about it. The following is a letter that I hand out to anyone who accuses me of racism:\n\nDear Sir or Madam;\n\nThis letter certifies that the holder, Michael Harriot, can\u2019t be racist. We have verified that he, indeed, has at least one white friend, which exempts him from all claims of reverse racism, regular racism, anti-whiteness or hatred of Caucasians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe undersigned signatories hereby vouch for Mr. Harriot that they are his white friends, and he has never complained about their dance skills, demeaned their potato salad or asked them why they kiss their dogs in the mouth.\n\nSigned,\n\nB.

For his part, Felix said he had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. News of the Moscow real estate deal came to light this week after democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a status report outlining dozens of leads they say they could not pursue after the republicans shut down the committee\u2019s investigation, according to Business Insider.\n\nHere is a rundown of how Sater was pursuing the Moscow deal, per Business Insider:\n\nSater and Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were pushing for the deal with VTB in Moscow at the height of the presidential election, in late 2015 and early 2016. The revelation will likely draw sharp scrutiny from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Sater first sent a non-binding letter of intent to Cohen outlining the terms of the \u201cTrump World Tower Moscow\u201d deal on October 13, 2015, The New York Times previously reported. Andrey Rozov, a Russian investor, had already signed it by the time Sater forwarded it to Cohen, and Trump signed the letter. Weeks later, the two men exchanged a series of emails gearing up to celebrate the Trump Tower Moscow deal. In the emails, obtained by The Times, Sater bragged about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Cohen he would \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on the deal. \u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater wrote, according to The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides being a Trump associate, Sater spent the past two decades as a top US intelligence asset for the DIA, CIA and the FBI. He even claims to have pursued high-level terrorists \u2014 including Osama bin Laden.\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he has been interviewed by Mueller. But it is very likely that Mueller is well aware of Sater\u2019s intelligence work because he was the FBI Director during much of the time he was working for the feds.", "keywords": ["moscow", "russian", "sanctioned", "pursued", "mueller", "election", "tower", "bank", "felix", "cohen", "trump", "vtb", "organization", "sater", "claims", "deal", "likely"], "polarity": 0.06828567055839785, "subjectivity": 0.35109974200883287},

Aside from appearing both in the most recent Star Wars release and in episode 1 of this season of Black Mirror, she\u2019s co-starring in the English musical film Been So Long, due out later this year on Netflix.\n\nSuffice to say, whether choosing a challenging new role or impressing us with her yoga skills on her highly entertaining Instagram page, Michaela Coel likes to push herself to new limits, and her hair is no exception. This chameleon loves to switch up her style, transitioning from her closely cropped natural to any number of wigs at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nAnd for those who take notice with judgment on the brain, this past weekend, she had this to say while rocking a pink ombre-dyed bobbed wig: \u201cSome of the righteous rally see my shaved head and start talking trash about my wig gang.

Your claims have been overlooked for too long. They make movies about make-believe stuff like Santa Claus, Bigfoot and Caucasians who can dance, but never took the time to address your fairy tale of reverse racism. Hell, they even made a TV show about the Great Pumpkin and a movie about a sexy rabbit, but nothing about racist writers! How could this be?\n\nWell, today we are going to address the systematic inequality directed at white people. Because black people don\u2019t control Congress, the Senate, every state legislature, the U.S. economy and the media like white people do, dedicating this\u2014our weekly look back at the emails, direct messages and tweets we receive\u2014to the topic is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t try.\n\nThis first tweet and email go hand in hand:\n\n\n\nFrom: J.M. and Tucker.\n\nTo: Danielle Belton\n\nSubject: Racism is evil, regardless of the source Ms. Belton, Instead of blaming \u201cwhite people (not a race by the way)\u201d for all the problems in the black community, why don\u2019t you offer some tough love to your fellow blacks? How about stay in school, don\u2019t have sex and get pregnant outside of marriage and obey the law. Or, take responsibility for your own actions, respect authority and work hard. I\u2019m sure there are black parents who are out there who are responsible and raise children who are responsible and positive contributors to society. However, there are a large percentage who do not. My parents and sisters came here from Italy with little more than the clothes on their backs. No one handed them a \u201cwhite privilege card\u201d. They worked hard, saved money and did the best they could for my family. My advice to black people is stop being blinded by a desire for vengeance against \u201cwhite people\u201d and work hard to be prosperous. As they say, \u201cliving well is the best revenge\u201d\n\nDear Bill, J.M. and Tucker:\n\nAs one of Ms. Belton\u2019s \u201cfellow blacks,\u201d I can attest to the fact that she comes to every one of the Global Organizations Dedicated to the Descendants of Africans, Moor and Negroes (GODDAMN) monthly meetings and tells the young kids to stay in school, use condoms and obey the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe younger \u201cfellow blacks\u201d just won\u2019t listen. You know how they are. Either they are too stupid to know what Danielle is telling them (you know they have lower IQs), or it might have something to do with the fact that unwed motherhood, the dropout rate and crime are all socioeconomic phenomena, and\u2014stripped of race\u2014poor whites have the same crime rate, teenage pregnancy rate and dropout rate. Danielle probably thinks the question should be, \u201cWhy is the black poverty rate so much higher?\u201d But you\u2019re right, J.M. It\u2019s probably because she doesn\u2019t scold her \u201cfellow blacks\u201d enough.\n\nCongratulations on the success of your cousins who moved here from Italy. I\u2019m sure it was difficult for them to succeed, given the fact that Giuseppe Crow Laws were just wiped off the books 50 years ago and the people in power now were the same people in power when this country was still lynching Italians for looking white people in the eye and they could only attend historically Italian colleges, universities and public schools. I\u2019m sure your cousins simply forgot the 250 years when black people couldn\u2019t\u2014as Tucker said\u2014go to the polls when we wanted higher wages, dignified jobs and \u201cleadership that promised to put [all] Americans first, above any foreign nation or domestic interest group.\u201d I guess black people didn\u2019t need that solution to their problems.\n\nHowever, you were right when you said, \u201cLiving well is the best revenge.\u201d That is true. I just wish people like you didn\u2019t build such a high barrier to \u201cliving well\u201d and then act as if we could eliminate the obstacle by telling our kids to \u201cjust climb higher\u201d and pretend like the wall was not there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you should consider this: Saying \u201cFuck the people who built and maintain this wall\u201d and making fun of the wall builders isn\u2019t racist. It\u2019s just a tiny, microscopic form of \u201cliving well.\u201d\n\nThanks, J.M.\n\nA Twitter direct message from xxneverdasamexx:\n\nI just read your piece about Tucker and when they asked you on his show on fox news. You want to stand on your soap box, make fun of and judge white people because they\u2019re racists? And you think it makes all the racist and bigoted stuff you write about whites ok? And your comment about the quote \u201cthrow a rock into a pack of dogs...\u201d I think that actually applies to you...Tucker called you out and the Root for being racists against whites, now your own logic and using the dog quote, amounts to that of it doesn\u2019t apply, the person will let it fly...but you didnt let it fly, you started yelling like the hit dog. You and the Root are obviously racists against whites. Now, let\u2019s take some of what you wrote about white people and said about white people...you don\u2019t think it makes you racist or that you are racist. But let\u2019s say I wrote everything you wrote, the exact same way, same words..exactly the same..but instead of white, I used black...you would label me a racist white supremacist nazi KKK pos...and you want to talk about how whites shoot up schools and wherever else you said whites do...how about I\u2019m tired of all the dumb blacks who sell heroin and crack all over my city.. how about I\u2019m tired of the dumb blacks who run around in groups, in my city, jumping and beating white people who are alone for no other reason then their white...and you\u2019re the worst type, becuase you\u2019re such a hypocrite that wants to cry and yell that whites are racist, when you spew nothing but racism. The person who see race and racism is everything, is the REAL racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Sir:\n\nYou\u2019re right, The Root shouldn\u2019t make fun of white people. We had no idea you were this fragile, and apologize for all the white tears we caused.\n\nYou are correct that if white people wrote an article making fun of black people the way I and others at The Root make fun of white people, we\u2019d call them racist. But it wouldn\u2019t be because of what you wrote or said. We would object to what you said because it is offensive in combination with how you actually treat black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to clap back at you by saying that unlike your frail, delicate, unseasoned, sallow spirits, black people wouldn\u2019t give a damn what you called us if you treated us equally. But I didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of everyone at The Root, so I posed this question to the entire staff this morning:\n\nSuppose you were the leader of all the black people in America and you were approached by the leader of all white people [I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Donald Trump or Taylor Swift] with this proposition: White people could magically erase all inequality, racism, hate, transphobia, homophobia, etc., in the world, but black people would have to agree to one thing: White people would get to address us only as \u201cniggers.\u201d ... Would you accept?\n\nSome immediately agreed to the proposition. Some wondered how we would enforce the agreement, while others didn\u2019t think it would ever work. There was a fierce debate going on until Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton came in and broke up the conversation and made us get back to work. (And yes, J.M., as we dispersed, she yelled, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t get pregnant or rob anyone today!\u201d See ... she\u2019s doing her part.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here is my point: Every single person considered it because we don\u2019t give a damn what you call us if you treat us equally! White people are more hurt about some motherfucking articles on a motherfucking website than they are about actual inequality! If that was the only racism black people had to face, we would rejoice.\n\nSo if you only wrote articles about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d in your city selling heroin (I\u2019m sure it got there on all those black-owned boats and planes) or only wrote about the \u201cdumb blacks\u201d who go around attacking whites, but you eliminated every other form of discrimination and hate, we wouldn\u2019t call you a \u201cracist white supremacist nazi, KKK\u201d piece of shit ...\n\nJust a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d\n\nFinally, a Twitter direct message:\n\nFrom: Mike Jones\n\nTo: Michael Harriot How does it feel to be one of the biggest racists in America?\n\nI\u2019d like to accept this award on behalf of all the black people who tried their hardest to win this title by simply talking about race. I\u2019d also like to thank some of the past winners, including the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Malcolm X and President Barack Obama, who were all called racists and accused of dividing the country by bringing up the subject of race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, I\u2019d like to thank my fellow nominees for this year.\n\nTo the white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.: I know you thought you had it in the bag this year. But just because you brought together every different kind of racist to terrorize a city doesn\u2019t mean you deserve this award. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut we actually killed someone, and Michael Harriot and the staff of The Root have never laid hands on another human being because of their race.\u201d Look, man, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. You just have to work harder next year. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\n\nTo Donald Trump: I know you\u2019re over there talking to the panel trying to convince them that there must have been some illegal voting, but let it go. Can\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re more racist than you are. You tried to ban Muslims from entering the country, painted Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and put known white supremacists in your Cabinet. But did you create the term \u201cwypipo\u201d? Did you make jokes about potato salad? No, but we did. Let this be a lesson to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let me tell you what makes us the proudest.\n\nIn 1983 Timothy Coggins was seen dancing with a white woman at the People\u2019s Choice nightclub in Griffin, Ga. A few white men got together and kidnapped Coggins. Two of the kidnappers were law enforcement officers. Then they beat him. Then they wrapped a chain around his neck and dragged him for over a mile. But he was still alive.\n\nSo the white men took a knife and stabbed him. They sliced him. They slit him. They took turns. When one of them was too tired, the next man would take over. Then they tied him to a truck again, dragged him a little while longer, then threw him in a ditch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in town knew who did it because they bragged about the time they killed a nigger and got away with it. One of the killers said he \u201cmissed the good old days when you could kill a black man for no reason.\u201d Another one of them told his wife, \u201cIf you keep on, you\u2019re going to wind up like that nigger in the ditch.\u201d\n\nBut no one told on these men for 34 years. The ones who kept quiet were complicit in the Coggins family\u2019s unending grief. Silence is the most despicable kind of racism there is. I wonder who Coggins\u2019 loved ones hate more: the men who killed Coggins that night, or the ones who knew but didn\u2019t give a damn about their pain and suffering?\n\nBut today I stand before you to tell you that Mike Jones, Tucker Carlson and Fox News viewers everywhere have declared that I and the rest of The Root staff, by poking fun at the flimsy, snowflakelike, thin, pearl skin of America\u2019s ruling class, are more racist than Bill Moore Sr. and Frankie Gebhardt, who allegedly killed Timothy Coggins and left him dying in a ditch, and all the white people who kept the terrible secret for 34 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank you.", "keywords": ["whites", "racist", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "blacks", "white", "im", "root", "sure", "mailbag", "butthurt", "black", "ok", "wrote"], "polarity": 0.03796901304713804, "subjectivity": 0.39948504764911},

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["saying", "evil", "job", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "blacks", "way", "welfare", "mailbags", "think", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

This lede was gonna be funny as hell, too. I was going to explain how this week\u2019s collection of emails, tweets and direct messages were all about politics and how people insert their political assumptions into whatever they read. This sentence was supposed to make a hilarious comparison about how every presidential candidate I\u2019ve ever voted for was also the one least likely to make me throw up if I saw them naked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut because of Yesha\u2019s incessant, racist harassment of me and my below-average typing skills, y\u2019all will miss out. You deserve better than this, but you only have Yesha to blame. Anyway, since I don\u2019t have time to craft a funny lede for the mailbag, Here\u2019s some mail.\n\nIt\u2019s a half day! I\u2019m not working beyond 10 a.m. So what a half-day means 1 p.m.? \u2014Yesha\n\nMerry Christmas, motherfuckers.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a fan of both Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party concerning the article about Doug Jones:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Starr C.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Who sent you? Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ...

Way to demonize white people when your own shit race is responsible for the most crime in the country despite being only somewhere between 12-15% of the population. Go educate yourself so you can have some context the next time you feel like you want to speak about something you are so clearly ignorant in.\u2019\n\nDear Mr. YouAreStupid:\n\nFirst, I and my \u201cshit race\u201d would like to thank you for going on Twitter, creating an account and naming it \u201cMichael YouAreStupid.\u201d I wish I had that much time on my hands, but bravo to you. You are obviously good at whatever you do ... and racism. You are very good at racism.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m glad you brought to my attention how much less advanced my \u201cshit race\u201d is than every other race. Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me. I don\u2019t hate dogs.\n\nBut I know they all have teeth.", "keywords": ["feel", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "unanswered", "white", "know", "black", "dogs", "im", "questions", "reverse", "mailbag", "dont", "race"], "polarity": 0.019458046194687433, "subjectivity": 0.41400055203490305},

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

They report on a controversial dossier that said Trump hired prostitutes to defile space where the American president and first lady had slept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPutin and his inner circle had nothing but utter contempt for Obama and his administration \u2014 much of it cast in racist terms,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write in \u201cRussian Roulette: : The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin and his top advisers routinely denigrated Obama and his national security team as \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018indecisive\u2019 \u2014 and then, contradictorily, blamed him for meddling in Russia\u2019s internal affairs. In Putin\u2019s presence, Obama would be called a \u2018monkey,\u2019 and it was not uncommon for the American president to be referred to as the N-word.\u201d\n\nThe book has been No. 1 on the Amazon best-sellers list for the past two days, Brian Stelter reported Wednesday for his \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorn and Isikoff continued, \u201cThe small number of U.S. officials privy to the reports from this source wondered if Putin and his crew truly viewed Obama in such crude terms. But the source\u2019s credibility was bolstered by a recent episode.\n\n\u201cMonths earlier, Irina Rodnina, a Russian figure skater, posted a racist tweet showing a doctored photo of Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama looking like monkeys and admiring a banana. The U.S. Embassy lodged a protest, and Rodnina claimed on Twitter that her account had been hacked. When the Sochi Olympics opened, Putin selected Rodnina, a member of his United Russia Party in the Duma, as one of two Russian athletes to light the Olympic torch. This seemed like a not-too-veiled message. . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d released Tuesday and accompanied by a blizzard of media appearances by its authors, repeats information from a dossier put together by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Steele had headed Britain\u2019s intelligence Russia desk, then started his own private investigative agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuoting the dossier, the authors write, \u201cSource D, described as \u2018a close associate of TRUMP who had organized and managed his recent trips to Moscow,\u2019 claimed that \u2018TRUMP\u2019s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs. OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a \u2018golden showers\u2019 (urination) show in front of him. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Steele dossier was published in full in January 2017 by BuzzFeed, which stated that the claims were all unsubstantiated and unverified but deserved to be made public. Other media outlets accused BuzzFeed of being irresponsible. However, the material in the dossier was said to have been shown to both Trump and Obama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors write that Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, had encouraged James Clapper, director of national intelligence, during the daily intelligence briefing to tell Obama about the \u201cgolden showers\u201d allegation.\n\n\u201cObama turned to Rice and said, \u2018Why am I hearing this?\u2019 He was incredulous,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write. \u201c \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 he asked. Rice said the intelligence community had no idea if this story was true but that Obama needed to be aware the allegation was circulating. \u2018You don\u2019t really expect to hear the term \u201cgolden showers\u201d in the President [cq] Daily Brief,\u2019 a participant in this meeting later said, \u2018or that the guy who is going to become president may be a Manchurian candidate.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe reporters also write, \u201cWhen [Vice President Joseph P.] Biden was briefed about intelligence reports on the connections between various players in the Trump orbit and the Kremlin, he had a visceral reaction. \u2018If this is true,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018it\u2019s treason.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d has a larger focus than Obama and race, as Steven Lee Myers wrote in a review published Wednesday by the New York Times. Myers notes that its \u201csubtitle promises to reveal \u2018the inside story of Putin\u2019s war on America and the election of Donald Trump,\u2019 but adds, \u201cAlas, it does not \u2014 at least so far as offering foolproof evidence of Putin\u2019s involvement, or his motives.\u201d\n\nStill, an excerpt published in Mother Jones touches on Trump\u2019s posture toward women of color. The setting is a 2013 visit to Moscow to support the Miss Universe pageant, which he owned.\n\n\u201cFrequently, Trump would toss out finalists and replace them with others he preferred. \u2018If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,\u2019 a Miss Universe staffer later noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnother Miss Universe staffer recalled, \u2018He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.\u201d On occasion, according to this staffer, Trump would reject a woman \u2018who had snubbed his advances.\u2019\n\n\u201cOnce in a while,\u201d Paula Shugart, the president of the Miss Universe Organization, \u201c would politely challenge Trump\u2019s choices.

Then came a loud pop as a bullet went right through Courtlin\u2019s heart, ending her life way too short of adulthood.\n\n\u2018 \u2018The last thing I told them was \u201cI love you\u201d and have a blessed day at school,\u2019 Courtlin\u2019s mom, Tynesha Tatum, who has another son and daughter in the same high school, told the Birmingham News. \u2018That was at 7:45 a.m\u2026At 3:45 p.m., I got a call that my baby got shot.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, Courtlin\u2019s schoolmates \u2014 her murder still ringing in their ears \u2014 are planning to walk out of school and protest the lack of safety for teenagers trying to grow up in the most gun-crazed nation on the planet. [They did so.] If you follow the news, it\u2019s almost certain that you\u2019ve already heard about the National School Walkout Day, which has become \u2014 rightfully so \u2014 a huge story from coast to coast. But it\u2019s almost a lock that you haven\u2019t heard at all about the loss of Courtlin Arrington.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Parkland, Florida, where the mass shooting of 17 kids in the upscale Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School upended the world of students who\u2019d been raised to expect the best things in life \u2014 and thus triggered a social revolution that is only starting to grow. No, Courtlin Arrington was killed by a handgun inside Huffman High School in Birmingham, Ala., in the kind of struggling urban district where kids have grown all too accustomed to hardship, even to violence.\n\n\u201cEven so, it was somewhat shocking that a shooting inside a school classroom received virtually no national coverage . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOf course, one death may seem less impactful than one of the 10 largest mass shootings in U.S. history, but tell that to Courtlin\u2019s classmates who will be traumatized by the sound of that fatal gunshot for the rest of their lives. There\u2019s no definitive way to know how much of the ignoring of her story was simply fatigue, in a nation where gun deaths remain off the charts, and how much is because both Courtlin and her alleged killer are African-Americans. . . .\u201d\n\nJenice Armstrong, Philadelphia Daily News: We must all support Wednesday\u2019s student walkout to toughen gun laws\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: New Orleans students to demand gun control in National School Walkout\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Baltimore Sun: Student walkout: Protest has a price\n\n\n\nEditorial, Buffalo News: In support of the student walkout\n\n\n\nEditorial, Chicago Sun-Times: In Chicago, 79 dead of guns so far this year.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["movie", "natural", "hero", "teamsupernatural", "panthers", "black", "designer", "really", "traditional", "panther", "friend", "think", "having", "camille", "meet", "hair"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

As we close out 2017, we would like to thank our haters because we don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without you. (Actually, we do know where we\u2019d be without you. We\u2019d be fractionally happier, I\u2019d probably have a better relationship with Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan, and the writers at The Root wouldn\u2019t have a faint sense of dread every time they open an email.)\n\nBut without you, none of this would have been possible. I\u2019d probably have to spend my Friday mornings doing something besides conjuring up the spirit of Ric Flair, so from all of us to all of you, we offer a sincere thumbs-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finger in the middle is the thumb, right?\n\nOur first selection pertains to a piece that serves as a yearly divining rod for white tears: the 2017 Wypipo Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst this comment from Iceseller:\n\nHey look everyone. The racist in chief of this racist blog wrote something racist again! How edgy. Fuck off you racist piece of shit. Maybe 2018 will see you fired and have to be racist somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis email from the cleverly named U. R. Gay:\n\nFrom U.R. Gay\n\nTo: Michael Harriot What If a white person wrote something the 2017 nigger awards you would call them a racist. You are a world-class racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this comment from Kodimah:\n\nImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\n\nDearest Iceseller, Mr. or Ms. Gay, and Kodimah:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Iceseller for pre-emptively naming me to the position of \u201cracist in chief,\u201d but as a firm believer in democracy, I cannot, in good conscience, accept the title without a vote of some kind. While your admiration for me is appreciated, there are candidates far more qualified who could serve in this position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake the aforementioned Mr. Gay, for instance (I don\u2019t want to gender-profile anyone, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume that U.R. Gay is a guy). He seems like a perfect nominee for the position. He said that I am a \u201cworld-class racist,\u201d which means he has apparently traveled the world ranking them. I would think that he would be a better fit to serve as the king of all racists.\n\nBut I\u2019d like to push this conversation forward by pointing out something that seems obvious to me but has obviously flown over the heads of some of our readers. The Root is a publication that covers black America. Racism against black people is a problem in America. We write about it. We are no more obsessed with race than Deadspin is obsessed with sports, The Takeout is obsessed with food, Jalopnik is obsessed with cars or Jezebel is obsessed with the fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It is literally my job to talk about race.\n\nI think Kodimah put it best when he or she said: \u201cImagine being so race obsessed you write a satiric column about another race thinking you aren\u2019t a gigantic racist yourself. Sad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain what white privilege is:\n\nImagine living in a building with a sniper waiting outside. Imagine that, every day, the sniper shot someone who was exiting your building. Sometimes the sniper was in full sight, and other days the sniper was hidden, but he kept shooting at the people who lived in the building as they walked out.\n\nWhite privilege is the ability to say, \u201cYeah, but people in other buildings get shot, too.\u201d White privilege is the penchant for residents of safer buildings to ask why you don\u2019t just move out of the building. White privilege is being able to say, \u201cYeah, snipers exist, but you can\u2019t worry about them all the time.\u201d But most of all, white privilege is the oblivious idiocy of standing on the sidewalk and asking someone who could be killed by a sniper at any minute, \u201cWhy are you so obsessed with snipers?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine reading a piece of satire written by a resident of the building, making fun of snipers. There is only one reason that I can surmise why anyone would be more angry at the person making jokes about snipers than they were at actual snipers:\n\nBecause they are a sniper, too.\n\nKodimah is right.\n\nIt is sad.\n\nFrom: Stephanie\n\nTo: The Root Staff The Root, I\u2019ve been a supporter for a long time. The fact that Skip Gates is a founder spoke to me about your integrity. Lately, I\u2019ve seen way too much cussing and specifically F bombs in your posts.\n\nIt\u2019s not cute. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s vulgar and common.\n\nIt\u2019s BENEATH you. As professional journalists and editors, if you must cuss to get your point across, you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Tired of it,\n\nStephanie\n\nStephanie, I get your point. I really do.\n\nMy mother is a wise woman and she, too, was a writer. When I was a kid, she forbade us from using vulgar language, including calling someone a \u201cdog,\u201d a \u201cliar\u201d or \u201cstupid.\u201d She only had two exceptions:\n\nif we were telling a story and the person in the story said the vulgar word or phrase if we could make a logical case why the word was necessary\n\nThose rules are basically the same rules to which we adhere at The Root. I know I have a foul mouth, and I am often asked by the editors and copy editors if a certain word is necessary. Sometimes they change those words without even asking me. I don\u2019t even have a problem with that because I know I can be hyperbolic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you are a regular reader of The Root, then you know we use a million creative insults, euphemisms and allusions to replace dirty words. I reject the idea that there are \u201cbad words\u201d or that using vulgar language is a sign of a lack of intelligence, and here is why:\n\nSome people are motherfuckers.\n\nThere is a difference between not giving a darn and not giving a fuck. Knocking the crap out of a person is different from slapping the shit out of someone. Sometimes the words you consider to be boorish are the ones that perfectly describe a situation or thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRacism, homophobia, discrimination and Donald Trump are vulgar. Tamping down the description of those things by playing lexical dodgeball with the vocabulary to preserve the pearls that our readers may clutch is not our job.\n\nA few days ago I wrote a story about a Sacramento, Calif., policeman named John Tennis who had a habit of trying to hit black suspects with his car. He shot multiple black people and killed at least two. Even his fellow police officers said that he often discharged his weapon when it wasn\u2019t necessary. Raheem Hosseini of the Sacramento News and Review wrote a puff piece about him that made him into a sympathetic figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could have called them both colostomy bags filled with racism and prejudice. I could have used flowery language to explain how Tennis exemplified the persistent deadly threat posed by men whose uniforms have become a license to cosplay as executioners. I probably could have blistered Hosseini as an entitled equivocator who uses black lives as a stepladder to get closer to the spotlight while using his pen to blot out the bloodstains of the slaughtered innocent. But no ...\n\nFuck those guys.\n\nWhenever we write about Umar Johnson, we get a lot of email from his followers. Here are three:\n\nA direct Twitter message from Kwesi X:\n\nDear sir, I am from overseas and would like to let you know how sick you make me. Why you\u2019ve spent all your time gunning for Dr umar I\u2019ll never know I just want u to answer, How many kids u council? How many people u visited in jail to do free speaking events? Even if u don\u2019t like umar if u really a journalist of credibility you would have presented a balanced article not a I hate umar hit story. You are a fake black owned company that is simply marketed to black people. But your not really helping are you? Just making money on the drama You should be ashamed of yourself\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these tweets:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear sirs,\n\nFirst of all, no one who is originally from outside the country says that he is \u201cfrom overseas.\u201d I don\u2019t believe you. You need more Hotep people.\n\nI admit that I am conflicted about using the word \u201cHotep\u201d as a derogatory term because I know the history of the word, but I will also confess that when I was assigned the Umar story, I thought, \u201cHere come the Hoteppers.\u201d I am also tired of writing about Umar Johnson, but I think it is my responsibility. I don\u2019t hate Johnson\u2019s message of \u201cblack consciousness,\u201d any more than I hate the bullshit of prosperity gospel, except for one fact:\n\nHe steals from black people.\n\nLet me be clear:\n\nI believe that black people should know their history. I believe that our connection to our ancestors is important. I believe that there should be a school for black boys with an African-centered education. I desperately hope that someone builds one. I hope there comes a day when there is one in every city and black children can learn how the great Greek philosophers had to go to Africa to get their knowledge, and how the noble, ancient Europeans were bitch-slapped by the Moors and learned agriculture, irrigation, science and astronomy from dark people. One day someone will come with a plan to build and fund this dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen that day comes, there will be people who say, \u201cI would donate, but the last time I gave money to something like this, a charlatan who claimed to be a descendant of Frederick Douglass conned me out of my coins.\u201d They will remember how he answered his phone while it was ringing and puffed up his chest whenever anyone asked him to show his Ph.D. People will recall how he publicly preached about the black family while fucking exotic dancers on the low-low. Some will bring up the fact that the last guy who was going to build a school would never show the receipts for how he spent the money.\n\nUmar Johnson\u2019s antics actually make it harder to build this school. If anyone ever achieves the goal of making this a reality, it will be in spite of Umar Johnson, not because of him.\n\nAnd we are not anti-Umar. When everyone doubted Johnson\u2019s degree, it was The Root that spent money to verify his Ph.D. and end the speculation.

I think someone slipped a headache into my drink last night at The Root 100 gala. It\u2019s either a hangover or I have sudden-onset brain cancer. That\u2019s not a thing, is it?\n\nOr maybe it was Social Media Editor Corey Townsend screaming the lyrics to Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d at me. Can I call the police? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a hate crime. Or terrorism. Or white supremacy.\n\nAnyway, there are many people who doubt the veracity of some of the mailbag letters because they apparently don\u2019t think people could be so shitty in real life. There are some who think the hate letters, emails and tweets we receive are from people who are trolling because they want to be featured in the mailbag. Some people even think we fabricate the letters and this whole \u201cmailbag\u201d thing is a ruse.\n\nNah, nigga. This shit is real.\n\nIn fact, this week, instead of hate mail, let\u2019s just look at some actual comments from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an actual comment \u201cMadril\u201d left on a story about a caf\u00e9 that refused to give candy to black kids on Halloween:\n\nSome of you will take this the wrong way because AA or Black Americans have been conditioned to be the victim in America. It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["say", "clapback", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "gray", "madril", "shit", "im", "black", "area", "think", "mailbag", "dont"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

In fact, \u2018are\u2019, not \u2018might be\u2019, given your willingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019. Why are you attacking white people, hon? Hypocrisy really escapes you, lol? Because YOU are projecting your own racist tendencies onto anyone who rejects your embarrassingly puerile and morally and intellectually dishonest narrative. But, hey, sweets, keep it up...you are doing a fabulous job of confirming that pompously moralizing social justice warriors are nothing but self-parodying attention seekers who repel even moderate liberals. Grow up, how embarrassing for you to publicly advertise your salivating junior high mean girl malice and ignorance.\n\nFrom: Meh1234 Oh noes! Oh noes! Not the flag! Nooooooooooooo. And OMG, you made an article about it! That means you, not just support it, but actively encourage it! Yeah, grow a pair; whichever ones you prefer. And she\u2019s right, btw. If you aren\u2019t bleeding, no bones are sticking out & you can breathe, STOP crying. It\u2019s easy to blame \u201cwhites\u201d for your issues, and it\u2019s hard to actually acknowledge that your problems are created by you. The day 13% of population stops committing 50% of crimes, is the day less shooting by cops against that 13% of population will occur. Kinda like magic, really. Nothing racist about it - we\u2019re, as humans; black, white, asian, doesn\u2019t matter really, as long we don\u2019t subscribe to marxist bullshit you do - tired of your whining. The whole world is tired of your whining. Guess what? Others were \u201coppressed\u201d as well, Ottoman\u2019s Empire in Balcans was a thing for 400+ years - longer than slavery in US - and you don\u2019t hear those people whining about their ancestors and how they are owed the world, do you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Blkk, runningnoodles and Meh1234,\n\nLook, I agree with all of you. Yesha is an oppressive racist. She makes me write that intro every week and she just asked me, \u201cWhere is the mailbag?\u201d The only reason she keeps doing this to me must be racism. #MikeLivesMatter.\n\n[It\u2019s 2:45 p.m. on Friday. I am ready to eat my edibles and drink some wine, yet here I am editing this. You are the oppressive one. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Blkk is right: If Keaton\u2019s mom supported \u201cthe racist BLM,\u201d Yesha would be cool with that because ... duhhh\u2014I never thought that Yesha was against white people. She even told me herself. She said to me, \u201cI have nothing against the alabasters.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I\u2019m pretty close. I had no reason not to believe her, but after reading your comments, I\u2019m beginning to suspect something is up with Yesha.\n\nI agree with runningnoodle\u2019s contention that Yesha\u2019s \u201cwillingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019\u201d is a little bit prejudiced. Yesha reached that spurious conclusion simply because she often sees the Ku Klux Klan waving the rebel flag during marches and skinheads proudly wearing it on their uniform. She refuses to factor in the possibility that people may use it to represent their heritage. Sure, it\u2019s a heritage of people who were willing to die so that slavery could endure, but why base her opinion on facts?\n\nThe man who designed the Confederate flag said that they were \u201cfighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause,\u201d but that is just another one of those \u201cfacts\u201d that Yesha factored in when she wrote about Keaton\u2019s mom. Facts are racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when Meh1234 included the \u201cfact\u201d that police shoot black people because 13 percent of the population commits 50 percent of crimes, Meh1234 leaves out the fact that a large percentage of those crimes are drug-related arrests, and even though whites use drugs at about the same rate, blacks are 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for them. But who\u2019s counting? Obviously not Meh1234.\n\nI just want to confirm with all of you that I have notified the proper authorities and warned them that they should keep an eye on Yesha\u2019s black identity extremism. After they laughed me off the phone, I decided to keep a dossier myself. I\u2019m updating it every day, since no one else will.\n\nDespite the fact that Yesha has never killed a black boy in cold blood and walked away scot-free; even though she has never denied anyone employment or housing because of their race; in spite of the fact that she didn\u2019t create an unequal education, political or criminal-justice system, the fact that she wrote about a white woman who is willing to take handouts on the internet while vilifying black people just because it\u2019s actually her job to do that is no excuse. Yesha and her highfalutin words are the real racists. I see it now. Thanks, guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for Yesha sullying innocent little Keaton, you are absolutely correct. Just because his mother is a racist and his father is a white supremacist doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Keaton will ... wait. Scratch that last point. I was about to use facts.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching her.\n\n[Also, I\u2019m not racist. I have white friends. I\u2019ve provided photographic evidence below. Ash\u00e9. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis next letter comes from a Facebook user. I don\u2019t know specifically what he\u2019s talking about, but his rant was epic. Enjoy.\n\n\n\nFrom: George S.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Fuck black lives matter nigger boy.. Always playing the fucking victims. Here is some good advice. Black fathers, stop being sperm donors. Black kids graduate high school. Black mothers graduate college and get married before you pop out 3 kids with 3 different men before you are 25. Black people are their own worst enemy. You are a pussy!! South Carolina , what a joke and yes us northerners make fun of people taking pics of snow dusting. What a clown!! Your nostrils stretch out to the center of your eyes. Not natural!! Plantation nigger, no doubt. That is right motherfucker, we never owned slaves. Totally different generation. A bunch of excuse makers who blame others for their races dysfunctions. Facts do not care about feelings asshole. You called Trump a racist but Obama gets a pass for having Al Sharpton as a close adviser and invited BLM to the White House. The double fucking standards. Black home ownership is the highest it has ever been under Trump. Keep drinking that Kool Aid.. Black people from the south might be the dumbest people ever. Simple mineed fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo hours later, when he received no response, he sent this:\n\nEqual rights comes with equal responsibility to respect the rights of those who do not agree with you. Guess who said that asshole. MLK!! Funny that Donald Trump did business in NYC for 40 years and he received awards from the NAACP and other groups and even Jesse Jackson praised his work on behalf of minorities, but he suddenly became a racist when he ran for president and sheep like you fall for it hook, line and sinker. It is like black people cant think with their ,and need the fake media to think for them. You are a sheep!!! So damn easily led.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear George,\n\nYou win. Your letter is unclapbackatable. You\u2019re right. Black fathers need to stop playing sperm donors. Black people need to get an education before having children. President Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House. I don\u2019t have a mirror in front of me right now, but my nose might actually stretch to the center of my eyes.\n\nYou are correct. By your definition of racism, neither you nor Donald Trump is a racist. You win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Kevin G\n\nTo: The Root I have been reading Jalopnik and Gizmodo for years. Recently your other articles from Kinja assets have been showing titles linking to racist articles. \u201c10 types of useless white people\u201d \u201cWhite people need to be better people\u201d And many more. I know you don\u2019t care about my opinion as a white person, but if the race of these articles were switched to any other race, YOUR teams would be shouting racism. I\u2019m sure you do this to get clicks and views, but I will no longer read anything published by your media company and it\u2019s support of racism. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nNo, Kevin!\n\nDon\u2019t go. I\u2019m begging you. Please stay. On behalf of all of the employees at The Root, I\u2019d like to offer my sincerest apologies. I had no idea we were assaulting your delicate sensibilities with our anti-white commentary. Trust me, we are ashamed of ourselves. In our Wednesday staff meeting, we often worry about the content of our site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live with constant concern about the flimsiness of the one-ply, Dollar Tree toilet-paper thickness of white skin. But now we understand the one thing we overlooked and the reason we have received so many complaints:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nCaucasian illiteracy is a growing problem in America that The Root has vowed to eliminate. After seeing the grammar and spelling in our hate mail, we realize these aren\u2019t isolated incidents; it\u2019s a national crisis equal only to the opioid epidemic, Chicago gun violence and when retail employees don\u2019t listen to a white woman who was obviously \u201ctold by AppleCare ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we understand that Caucasians can\u2019t quite read the posts we write about homophobia in the black community, crime and misogyny. Now we fully see that when we criticize women like Tomi Lahren, Taylor Swift and former Officer Betty Shelby, we\u2019re being racist. But when we condemn people like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele or Arizona Police Officer Philip \u201cMitch\u201d Brailsford, who shot Daniel Shaver in cold blood, apparently white people can\u2019t read those articles.\n\nWhen we called out Ray Rice for his anti-anthem stance, Lil Wayne for his anti-Black Lives Matter comments, Migos for homophobia, Steve Harvey for joking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, Sheriff David Clarke for the murders in his prison or Ben Carson for his support of Donald Trump, our fairer-skinned brethren didn\u2019t quite have the requisite level of reading comprehension to enjoy those pieces. When I wrote about the culture of black male silence surrounding sexual assault, I should have done it phonetically. And apparently, Damon Young\u2019s viral piece \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d was too filled with words for our white audience.\n\nWe\u2019re going to change this, Kevin. Not just for you but for all of our white audience that accuses us of racism. I know you must be correct in your assessment of The Root because if not, it could only mean that you are being willfully ignorant and would rather call us racists than admit that there is a possibility that you pay attention only to things that confirm your own biases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019d never do that, Kevin.\n\nI just want you to stay. We\u2019ll do better, Kevin. I promise. Don\u2019t leave us. We are going to miss your one or two page views per week. We might have to close up shop. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m being sarcastic or facetious. I care about you.

First, I would like to apologize to the readers who trusted me to bring them the latest and best clapbacks of the week.

I have failed you.\n\nThis week, through the magic of the great technical team at Fusion Media Group, I discovered that I have overlooked some of you for far too long. I discovered that I have whole-ass accounts to which fans have been sending tons of messages hate mail.

To think colleges and universities used to be institutions of higher education. The insults you throw at the president of the United States and other politicians simply demonstrates that you graduated from kindergarten (maybe) and have no respect for this country. Please return to Iran or Yemen or whatever \u201craghead\u201d country you probably still call home. Do not pass \u201cgo\u201d, do not collect your passport, you won\u2019t need it any longer. The true Americans don\u2019t want you here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks for your reply, Ray. It\u2019s obvious that you and I are kindred spirits. While I love Anne, I, too, think she far too often writes about issues and news with a bias toward that nonsense people learn in college. I have spoken with her privately about using things like facts, scientific studies and research. She will never get anywhere in life doing that.\n\nDuring our impromptu counseling sessions, I\u2019ve told her that if she wants to be a \u201ctrue American\u201d like you, she must learn to get the truth from the one place where all real Americans find it: their guts.\n\nBut I could tell she was confused. See, Anne can\u2019t shake free from the indoctrination she received by getting an actual master\u2019s degree in journalism and instead adhere to the journalistic integrity of random yahoos who email her to tell her to go back to countries she\u2019s not from. You see, Anne has not come to the realization that there is a difference between \u201cthe truth\u201d and \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has yet to comprehend the fact that we live in a post-truth society where one can deny climate change because it feels colder, or white people can grab tiki torches and commit acts of terror because they feel oppressed. I continue to work with Anne on this, but there\u2019s one other question that I\u2019d like to ask you:\n\nWhy did you feel the need to censor the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Did you think a woman would be OK with your calling her a \u201cstupid commie\u201d or a \u201craghead\u201d but then clutch her pearls when she read the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Are racism and xenophobia OK in your circle, but sexism is going too far?

When your parents, grandparents or great-grandparents came to this country, did they not become \u201ctrue Americans\u201d? How long does it take?

Starting with a lie is a bad foundation. I am positive you never served your country in any way shape or form as Mr. Kaep has also not served. Also I am sure you will not allow me to tell you how to spend your money. Just as you can not tell any NFL owner how to spend theirs. NFL owners do not have to put out a good product because it is not necessary for them to do so to make millions. They have blind follows. It is always about money. I do not watch The NFL nor do I support what they stand for because starting from the owners, coaches and players they are all over paid for whatever skill,or talent people feel they have there by creating all this ego and false value. Just like writers like yourself and those you work with who continually spew out their praises. I understand Mr Kaep\u2019s cause and realize it is a worthy one but he should have picked a different a venue to express himself. Get a life and write about something else. Oh yes try to tell the truth a forgotten area in your chosen profession\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Jo,\n\nThank you for your service. (I don\u2019t know if you have ever served in the military\u2014I\u2019m talking about your service to whiteness.)\n\nHere\u2019s a surprise: I actually agree with you. You have every right to disagree with the Colin Kaepernick protest. It is supposed to upset you. That is the point of a protest. However ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat does not mean anyone has to give a fuck.\n\nDo you think Rosa Parks gave a fuck about the people who were going to be late on that Montgomery, Ala., bus? I bet Harriet Tubman never considered the slave owners\u2019 financial losses; nor did civil rights workers worry about the people who wanted to sit down and eat their grilled-cheese sandwiches at segregated lunch counters. When state troopers cracked John Lewis\u2019 skull open on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., I\u2019m sure, as he faded into darkness, that there is one thought that never crossed his mind:\n\n\u201cDamn, this is really going to screw up traffic.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry that you wish Kaepernick had picked a different venue to protest. The next time a black mother is crying over the body of her son as the blood spills onto the concrete from the bullet piercings, I will be sure to send her a note asking:\n\n\u201cCan you pick a different venue to mourn?\u201d\n\nOne year ago this week, I was asked to mediate a microscopic difference of opinion (it wasn\u2019t really a beef) about the film The Birth of a Nation after a prominent news anchor (Roland Martin) disagreed with a writer at The Root (Yesha Callahan) who said that the film was a flop, saying that she was dancing on the film\u2019s grave. His comments resembled the sentiments of many black men that black feminists had doomed the movie, so I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that piece was published, I received a lot of backlash, including this voice message, which is exactly 1 year old today.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

Niggers like you are why black people can\u2019t get anywhere. First you wrote that piece of trash about Doug Jones flyer, then you bash the democratic party. Your always bashing Hillary and democrats, because you and the rest rest of the Bernie bros are still mad that she beat him FAIR AND SQUARE!!!! You at the reason Trump won. I bet you voted for him, but even if you didn\u2019t you spent so much time bashing Hillary that you paved the way for him. You don\u2019t even realize that the republicans don\u2019t mena black people no good. Every time you bash the democrats,you\u2019re helping them. You might as well be the KKK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re right, Starr. You figured it out. I\u2019m the reason Hillary lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that she took states in the Rust Belt for granted. It wasn\u2019t that she called black people \u201csuperpredators.\u201d It wasn\u2019t because she has such a long history of underhanded shenanigans that President Barack Obama\u2019s voters felt no enthusiasm for her. It wasn\u2019t that she popped up at black churches and barbershops pandering to black people with the see-through bullshittery of how one of her best friends from college \u201cis African American.\u201d\n\nIt was me the whole time.\n\nHad I been \u201cwith her,\u201d she would\u2019ve won because I would\u2019ve told her ass to stop cheating so much. I would have told her not to try to rig the primaries. I would have told the Democratic Party to stop assuming they had the black vote by default. I would have told her to put something about black lives and police brutality in her platform before Black Lives Matter literally forced her to do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would have told her to stop lying and fainting. I would have given her something better to wear than pastel-colored karate suits. I would have told her to stop warmongering and nation building. And lying. And fainting. I would have asked her why the fuck was she so moderate? I would have asked her why she was chasing white voters like they owed her $20. I would have made her secure the bag.\n\nMost importantly, had I been with her, I never would have made her, Doug Jones, the Democratic Party or any other white person on the face of the earth into a savior.\n\nThe reason they treat black people like shit is that too many of us believe that just because Hillary, Doug or any other Democrat is slightly better than a Republican, we should be afraid to publicly criticize them. The Democratic Party is the proverbial plantation from which black people are afraid to run because our massa is slightly more benevolent than the other slave owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sorry Donald Trump is president, but I am not sorry that Hillary Clinton is not my president.\n\nFuck her.\n\nI do not want a slightly better slave master.\n\nI want to be free.\n\nHere\u2019s an email from a Bernie Sanders supporter:\n\n\n\nFrom: Karla P.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: Bernie would of won. I loved your piece on the Cornel West feud. I just have one thing to say about your criticism of Bernie Sanders. I know the black community was pulling for Hillary because we blindly vote for whichever Democrat they give us, but her record shows that she was never going to do anything for us. She didn\u2019t do anything for us as a Senator. She didn\u2019t take a stand for us during her husband\u2019s presidency or during her campaign. What you don\u2019t realize about Bernie is that he has been fighting for us since the civil rights movement. Our allegiance to the Democratic party is what kills us politically because they take our votes for granted. The only way our votes will ever matter is if we make politicians earn it. If not for people like you Constantly kissing Hillary\u2019s ass and downing candidates like Bernie, he would of won. Stop leading your people like sheep to the slaughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Karla!\n\nThank you so much for your kind words in the first paragraph. As for the second part of your email\u2014I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Karla: I am a fan of Bernie Sanders. I want to meet him one day and shake his old, wrinkled hand because I bet it feels like grabbing a pack of hot dogs wrapped in a silk handkerchief. I know it would probably give me the heaves, but I just want to see how it feels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Bernie as a candidate? He lost, boo. You and the rest of his supporters can stop crying those socialist Democrat white tears any day now. Let that shit go! I know you think Hillary rigged the race, and so do I. But you know what? That\u2019s your fault. What the fuck is wrong with you that you sided with the one white motherfucker on the planet with too much integrity to cheat?\n\nI\u2019m why Bernie lost?\n\nOld man Sanders lost because he brought a rusty-ass, antique knife to a gunfight. I wish politics were more honest, but as long as they aren\u2019t, I want someone who\u2019s willing to slit throats, not some decrepit, counterfeit do-gooder in a J.C. Penney\u2019s suit! Do you know what would have happened if Bernie were in office? The Republican majority in the House and Senate would have eaten him alive and spit him out. Because\u2014and I\u2019m just guessing here\u2014he tastes like a sixth-grade social studies test boiled in hot dog water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think the only hope for American politics is a true third-party candidate, so I feel no allegiance to the Democratic or Republican Party. I vote for the candidate I want to win, and 99.9 percent of the time, that candidate is a Democrat.\n\nI liked many of Bernie\u2019s ideas and political theories. But I like them in the same way I like the idea of eating a box of hot Krispy Kreme doughnuts while sitting courtside at the Staples Center during Game 7 of the NBA Finals as Lonzo Ball passes the ball to the newly signed LeBron James, who hits the game-winning shot for the Lakers. And as I\u2019m being hugged by Beyonc\u00e9, I barely have time to high-five Colin Kaepernick and congratulate him on his new job as the starting quarterback of the Carolina Diddies before Rihanna taps me on the shoulder and asks me if I want to go to the bathroom and hit the blunt with her, but I can\u2019t ... because you know how my wife gets mad because Rihanna is always sweatin\u2019 me, and I don\u2019t want to argue in the helicopter on the way home.\n\nA Bernie Sanders presidency is as unlikely as that scenario.\n\nKrispy Kreme donuts are trash. Also, I hate the way you\u2019ve just spelled \u201cdoughnuts.\u201d \u2014Yesha\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext are a series of direct messages from a Trump supporter on Twitter named Robert O. You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand them, but because I\u2019ve corresponded with so many low-IQ white people since I\u2019ve begun my stint at The Root, I have become fluent in the \u201calt-right\u201d dialect of English. Each one of these is actually a separate message.\n\n\n\nUr a duck\n\nI think he means \u201ccuck,\u201d which is short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d a man who likes to watch other men have sex with their wives. It\u2019s a popular term for people on the alt-right to use against other white men who aren\u2019t as racist as them. Some white people believe that if they aren\u2019t racist enough, they won\u2019t be able to stop the impending black-penis attack that \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are planning.\n\nCuck\n\nSee, I told you.\n\nAnd a beta male\n\nA beta male is a weak man, not like a strong alpha male. Or maybe he thinks I pledged a white fraternity. Are betas a thing? Can they step?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one I\u2019m not too sure about.\n\nUr politics are garbage\n\nWe use \u201ctrash\u201d now, Robert.\n\nBy the way, I just looked at your name, and it is one of the few names that are equidistant from both the center of blackness and whiteness. \u201cRobert\u201d isn\u2019t a black name or a white name. It\u2019s just a name. It\u2019s a manly name, though. Roberts probably work hard all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often try to imagine what people do just from their names and the letters they write, and I bet you wear gloves to work, Robert. You\u2019re probably employed on a highway crew or cutting meat behind the glass at a grocery store. Yeah, butcher is definitely a \u201cRobert\u201d job. You don\u2019t find many Roberts in the baking or choreographer industries. But I digress ...\n\nUr view all trump supporters are nazis is garbage\n\nThanks for helping my argument, Rob.\n\nAnd ur articles are trash\n\nThat\u2019s fair. See, I told you \u201ctrash\u201d sounds much better!\n\nYou\u2019re welcome!\n\nBlack women are ashy white women are bitchy Asian women eat cats and Hispanic women have fat asses we all have stereotypes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, Rob, that\u2019s your list of stereotypes? I feel like you could use some help in the stereotyping department. I don\u2019t want to sound racist, but you\u2019re missing out on some good ones.\n\nAll you have for black women is that they\u2019re ashy? Also, are you sure you want to give the \u201cfat asses\u201d to Hispanic women? I would never impugn your racist credentials, but I feel like, statistically speaking ...\n\nYou know what? Imma let you have this one.\n\nSo stop being a faggot\n\nBut I thought I was a cuck? You\u2019re confusing me, Rob. Am I an amphibious bird, the husband of an adulteress or a bundle of sticks? Make up your mind! And why are you on Twitter so much? Those yellow lines aren\u2019t going to paint themselves!\n\nAnd ban me from twitter u west coast lookin. Bitch\n\nWait ... I can do that?\n\nAnd, finally, from a supporter of ... umm, white people?\n\n\n\nFrom: Mitch There\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community, Michael. Yes they contributed mightily, but so did the media, thousands of volunteers, women, college-age voters (check the campus-town votes), Republicans who refused to vote, Richard Shelby (the write-in votes alone would have made up the difference) and a shit candidate. Happy to see it all working. Let\u2019s keep it all energized for high voter turnout in 2018 and 2020. Identity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of clapping back at Mitch, I\u2019d like to critique and highlight some of my favorite parts of this Twitter direct message.\n\nThe part about how \u201cthere\u2019s no need to take sole credit for the Black Community\u201d is good, because it insinuates that there was another community that voted for Doug Jones. White women voted for Roy Moore. White men voted for Roy Moore. Black men and women voted for Doug Jones. But history shows us that when a white person tells you \u201cthere\u2019s no need\u201d for something, they are about to steal that shit.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s another good part: \u201cYes they contributed mightily but ... \u201d Always remember that everything after the word \u201cbut\u201d is always a lie.\n\nThen there\u2019s the part where he credits \u201cthe media ... volunteers, women, college-age voters ... \u201d Again, he\u2019s white-peopleing. If he extrapolated the statistical data using this thing called \u201cmath\u201d and applied it to college-age voters, he\u2019d see that white college students voted for Roy Moore. The same is true for the campus towns, women, people named \u201cNancy,\u201d people who like hot sauce instead of honey mustard and even praise dancers. This white boy just cannot give black people their due!\n\nWait ... did this motherfucker just say, \u201cRepublicans who refused to vote\u201d? REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSED TO VOTE? He\u2019s so desperate in his white-mannery that he thinks Republicans who didn\u2019t vote are the same as the black people who caused the biggest political upset since Philip \u201cUncle Phil\u201d Banks was elected to a district court judgeship on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. According to Mitch, here\u2019s who should share the glory (in no particular order): black people who voted, white people who overwhelmingly voted for the guy who lost, people doing their motherfucking jobs and white people who did abso-fucking-lutely nothing. That might be the whitest thing ever said, but you gotta admit: It\u2019s a damn good part.\n\nYou might not have noticed the part where he said: \u201cLet\u2019s keep it all working.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s\u201d as in \u201clet us.\u201d You think Mitch has some black people in his pocket? Who the fuck is the \u201cus\u201d? You think I don\u2019t know the old Caucasian \u201cwe won\u201d trick, Mitch? I liked that part, though. If only for its sliminess.\n\nBut my favorite part? The part where this glib stool sample of alabaster arrogance said: \u201cIdentity politics spells losses. It\u2019s wins that count, not credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore appealing to white voters wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Talking about protecting Confederate monuments wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Acting as if the Lord and Savior Jesus Harrison Christ commanded those who believeth in him to vote for Moore wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d Doug Jones mailing a racist-adjacent flyer with a black man bug-a-booing on the front like a new-millennium Sambo wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 repeated invocation of the names of the four little girls killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church every time he got in front of black people, as if those victims gave him a political endorsement, wasn\u2019t \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nBut me pointing out the statistical fact that black people were the only group who supported Jones, while white people from Alabama acted like white people from Alabama always do, but they now want credit for some shit they didn\u2019t do ... I\u2019m the one playing \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.", "keywords": ["identity", "insert", "clapback", "roots", "politics", "white", "women", "vote", "title", "wasnt", "told", "clever", "bernie", "mailbag", "voted", "black"], "polarity": 0.0626698244677697, "subjectivity": 0.450799465628233},

Yes, we\u2019re making it a day of the week. The name \u201cFriday\u201d wasn\u2019t imaginative enough. Plus, it has nothing to do with frying. If they only served fried chicken and french fries, then I\u2019d be cool with the name, but I think the last day before the weekend should be reserved for clapping back.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about how we here at The Root respond to the hateful tweets, emails or comments; I\u2019m talking about you, too. Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week? Send an anonymous note to Sheila in human resources telling her she needs to use better deodorant, if only for the one day you have team meetings. Scream \u201cFuck you\u201d to the mailman who left your packages from Amazon.com in the rain.\n\nLet this be a healing day because the end of the week should be a catharsis so that you can empty out your negative energy and absorb something positive. Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends. Or maybe you can\u2019t because your the one whose the racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg,\n\nFirst of all ... what anti-white jokes? I was being serious. Every single time.\n\nI\u2019m glad you sent this. I have often been accused of being a racist. So often, in fact, that I decided to be proactive about it. The following is a letter that I hand out to anyone who accuses me of racism:\n\nDear Sir or Madam;\n\nThis letter certifies that the holder, Michael Harriot, can\u2019t be racist. We have verified that he, indeed, has at least one white friend, which exempts him from all claims of reverse racism, regular racism, anti-whiteness or hatred of Caucasians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe undersigned signatories hereby vouch for Mr. Harriot that they are his white friends, and he has never complained about their dance skills, demeaned their potato salad or asked them why they kiss their dogs in the mouth.\n\nSigned,\n\nB.

I\u2019ve been asked that question a million times (I\u2019m bad at math). But I thought we should take some time to explore this question.\n\nIt might give our readers some insight into why we choose to jab back at those who send us hate mail, insulting tweets and ugly comments. It might help you understand why The Root started this weekly tradition. But mostly because Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan makes me write these introductions every week [Hey, Harriot, I see you talking about me because I\u2019m editing this. Introductions are important! \u2014Yesha].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, a bully named Jamaal was about to beat up one of my friends when Jamaal tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass. Scared, I ran home and hid in the house. My mother saw the fear in my eyes, and do you know what she did? She grabbed me by my collar and said: \u201cAight. I mean ... Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal. That\u2019s when I realized: A smart, witty retort is even better than kicking someone\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, that story is 100 percent fake. The following emails are 100 percent real. Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["hate", "point", "wypipo", "clapback", "thats", "roots", "women", "white", "article", "tripping", "jamaal", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "important"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

It is not so much hate mail as it is white mail.\n\nOK, to be honest, it is pretty hateful, but it also embodies every piece of whiteness that has ever existed. It is a condensation of every microscopic molecule of Caucasianness. When I talk about \u201cwypipo,\u201d this is who I meant. We now have a mascot. The email is epic in its level of paleness and lack of melaninity. It is all the white things! When you read it, you will feel ...\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s just read the letter.\n\nFrom: Nancy\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: Your vile, sick, self deluded article Hey Michael Regarding your hateful rant about white people. If you think we are so bad you really need to go back to your African homeland where your own tribal leaders and ancestors pimped you for profit to jewish ship owners. Nothing to do with white europeans you despise so much. In Africa your honeland youll find they still never got civilized but there are cannibal warlords in Liberia. As Ben Carson said, a decent black man who excelled in a white mans world.\u201d the best thing that ever happen to the black man was slavery as it gave them the opportunity they would have never had in Africa\u201d you guys benefit from our civilization and our inventions. Cars, planes, trains, phones, electricity, tv, radio, archetecture. Roman and greek civlization is western civilization and Im sorry your ancestors are sad ass voo doo cannibals who never made a civlization.. Deal with it instead of hate and blame. Obama is a MuslIm which is very odd as Islam are the first to enslave your black ass. Go to Islam see what they still do to blacks today. So you should be thanking white men. We let you become millionairs in our society, Presidents, educated. Your complaining is vile and makes you unworthy. As far as crime. Lets face the facts. 40, 000 white women arr raped a year by black mren. White men dont rape black women. Wonder why? 300,000 black on white crimes a year. It is racial targeted hate. We cant help we are a beautiful intelligent race. But your acts of violence are transparent. We dont protest the way you people do as we have jobs. Not on welfare. In Japan during Fukishmi not one act of violence or looting. An honorable people. Katrina and other Us disaster its your breathen doing the looting not whites. It appears to me \u201cMichael\u201d sadly the name of a great warrior archangel you disgrace with your racial hate, jealosy, lies, and most import self delusions. What you are inciting with your so called \u201cpoetry\u201d is that of your voo doo ancestors demonic verbal diarrhea . Id like to look you in the eys and expel your bullshit out of you. Your a disgrace to humanity and ungrateful trash. Like your islamic Breathen foul and unholy Obama.You will fall from your throne of hate and deceit and lies soon enough by the wrath of God. May i suggest you go to church and pray rather than hating on white peopke and twisting the reality. You could never make a civlization absent us and now think your going to slander us the hijack and get unearned credit. Well try. When we fight back I assure you we will win as we always do since the history of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Nancy,\n\nFirst of all, when you talk about my vile, racist rant against white people, it would be helpful if you pointed out which one. How am I supposed to know? That would be like going to a place where white people go (like Yankee Candle or wherever y\u2019all buy those Caucasian-fit jeans) and asking, \u201cMay I speak to a racist?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not why I selected your letter for mailbag honors. I chose this letter because I love you, Nancy. I want to meet you and marry you. I want you by my side for the rest of my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not for any romantic reasons, Nancy. My love for you is really selfish. From here to eternity, whenever I speak about racism, hate and the laughable fragility of wypipo and someone objects, I only wish that I would be able to say, \u201cHave you met my wife, Nancy?\u2019\n\nThe way your well-greased whiteness slid effortlessly from a \u201cGo back to Africa\u201d into a diatribe about black rapists, directly into a \u201cYou were better off as slaves,\u201d then transitioned into a lazy, welfare-nigga stereotype, may have been the most difficult combination of fucktastic bigotry I have ever witnessed on a page. I allowed David Duke to read your letter, and he was like, \u201cDamn, that bitch is racist!\u201d\n\nAnd where the fuck did the \u201cObama is a Muslim\u201d part come in? I gotta admit, Nancy, that shit came out of nowhere. It surprised me because I thought you were going in a whole different direction, but then you pivoted on me and wedged a little Islamophobia in there. And you prefaced it with a Ben Carson reference. And the subtle anti-Semitism of blaming slavery on the Jews was revelatory. It\u2019s rare to find respectability, white supremacy, Jew hate and Muslim hate right next to one another, without a new paragraph or anything. Well played, Nancy. Well played.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Nancy, I hate to point this out, but they would fire me at The Root if I didn\u2019t. If I didn\u2019t ask the following question, Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton would call me into her office and ask me what the hell was wrong with me. She would probably stage an intervention, so I am compelled to ask:\n\nWhere the fuck is Islam?\n\nYou said I should \u201c[g]o to Islam and see what they still do to blacks today\u201d? How? I went on Travelocity and couldn\u2019t find a direct flight to Islam. Could you tell me the nearest airport? Do they have hotels, or would I need an Airbnb? There are so many questions I have, but we don\u2019t have enough time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I were to clap back at this letter (which I won\u2019t because I\u2019m praying that you and I become pen pals), I would dispel that whole notion about the scourge of black men raping white women by telling you to read this article:\n\nBut I would never do that, because I know you don\u2019t read, Nancy. Plus, I\u2019m not clapping back at you, remember? If I were, I\u2019d ask you how you could tell black people that you are not responsible for the sins of your ancestors and then turn around and take credit for all of Western civilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt defies logic, but then again, I know you didn\u2019t enslave me, Nancy. I am 100 percent clear that you had nothing to do with slavery, even though you somehow made slavery Barack Obama\u2019s fault. (Again, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the Obama part. Bravo, Nancy.)\n\nYou know what else I know, Nancy? I know you didn\u2019t invent shit, either. You couldn\u2019t build a boat, a house or a civilization. You can barely build a shitty email.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that you have personally never done anything to me, but I know you have done something to someone black, Nancy, simply by existing. Simply by believing that you \u201clet\u201d us be millionaires and president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore I go, since we are in the mood to take credit, allow me to take credit for something my people have given to mediocre white women whom Darwinian evolution should have stamped out long ago. Allow me to pat myself on the back for the one thing that my people have \u201clet\u201d vile, disgusting, barely literate bitches like you be:\n\nAlive.", "keywords": ["hate", "didnt", "clapback", "read", "roots", "know", "white", "email", "women", "im", "whitest", "dont", "mailbag", "black", "nancy"], "polarity": -0.050368051260908424, "subjectivity": 0.4903705421562561},

From her home in Ivory Coast, she was gracious enough to speak with The Glow Up about her inspiration and process (Editor\u2019s note: As Ky\u2019s first language is French, there has been minor paraphrasing for clarity):\n\nI always loved everything about style in general, and hair included. I\u2019ve known how to braid since I was 4 or 5, but what really inspired me to sculpt my hair is an Instagram photo album that I saw a year ago. That album presented the hairstyles that women wore long ago in some African tribes. It made me fall in love with my African culture more than I already was before. These were really impressive and artistic, and it made me want to use the hairstyle as one of my means of expression.\n\n\u201cImpressive and artistic\u201d are certainly appropriate words to describe Ky\u2019s hair sculptures, many of which would be as at home in a Tim Burton film as in the African tribes that inspired her. Ladders, animals and whimsical shapes and silhouettes of all kinds literally sprout from Ky\u2019s brain, telling both her stories and those of many of her approximately 60,000 followers on Instagram.

And with the return of natural hair to the black community, hairstyle has become a beauty asset, a way of self-affirmation and a claim of its beauty. To use the hairstyle as [a] means of expression is therefore a powerful means, because it speaks to all black women who for a long time have [been made to] believe that their hair was not dope enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKy hopes to eventually exhibit and sell her series of vulnerability-inspired images\u2014but in the interim, she doesn\u2019t take the overwhelmingly positive response she\u2019s received lightly:", "keywords": ["african", "artistic", "means", "hairstyle", "away", "instagram", "beauty", "artist", "kys", "hairstory", "insecurities", "styling", "black", "hair", "ky", "making"], "polarity": 0.15338383838383834, "subjectivity": 0.5628619528619528},

In fact, \u2018are\u2019, not \u2018might be\u2019, given your willingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019. Why are you attacking white people, hon? Hypocrisy really escapes you, lol? Because YOU are projecting your own racist tendencies onto anyone who rejects your embarrassingly puerile and morally and intellectually dishonest narrative. But, hey, sweets, keep it up...you are doing a fabulous job of confirming that pompously moralizing social justice warriors are nothing but self-parodying attention seekers who repel even moderate liberals. Grow up, how embarrassing for you to publicly advertise your salivating junior high mean girl malice and ignorance.\n\nFrom: Meh1234 Oh noes! Oh noes! Not the flag! Nooooooooooooo. And OMG, you made an article about it! That means you, not just support it, but actively encourage it! Yeah, grow a pair; whichever ones you prefer. And she\u2019s right, btw. If you aren\u2019t bleeding, no bones are sticking out & you can breathe, STOP crying. It\u2019s easy to blame \u201cwhites\u201d for your issues, and it\u2019s hard to actually acknowledge that your problems are created by you. The day 13% of population stops committing 50% of crimes, is the day less shooting by cops against that 13% of population will occur. Kinda like magic, really. Nothing racist about it - we\u2019re, as humans; black, white, asian, doesn\u2019t matter really, as long we don\u2019t subscribe to marxist bullshit you do - tired of your whining. The whole world is tired of your whining. Guess what? Others were \u201coppressed\u201d as well, Ottoman\u2019s Empire in Balcans was a thing for 400+ years - longer than slavery in US - and you don\u2019t hear those people whining about their ancestors and how they are owed the world, do you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Blkk, runningnoodles and Meh1234,\n\nLook, I agree with all of you. Yesha is an oppressive racist. She makes me write that intro every week and she just asked me, \u201cWhere is the mailbag?\u201d The only reason she keeps doing this to me must be racism. #MikeLivesMatter.\n\n[It\u2019s 2:45 p.m. on Friday. I am ready to eat my edibles and drink some wine, yet here I am editing this. You are the oppressive one. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though Blkk is right: If Keaton\u2019s mom supported \u201cthe racist BLM,\u201d Yesha would be cool with that because ... duhhh\u2014I never thought that Yesha was against white people. She even told me herself. She said to me, \u201cI have nothing against the alabasters.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but I\u2019m pretty close. I had no reason not to believe her, but after reading your comments, I\u2019m beginning to suspect something is up with Yesha.\n\nI agree with runningnoodle\u2019s contention that Yesha\u2019s \u201cwillingness to conflate an image of the Confederate flag with \u2018racism\u2019\u201d is a little bit prejudiced. Yesha reached that spurious conclusion simply because she often sees the Ku Klux Klan waving the rebel flag during marches and skinheads proudly wearing it on their uniform. She refuses to factor in the possibility that people may use it to represent their heritage. Sure, it\u2019s a heritage of people who were willing to die so that slavery could endure, but why base her opinion on facts?\n\nThe man who designed the Confederate flag said that they were \u201cfighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause,\u201d but that is just another one of those \u201cfacts\u201d that Yesha factored in when she wrote about Keaton\u2019s mom. Facts are racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike when Meh1234 included the \u201cfact\u201d that police shoot black people because 13 percent of the population commits 50 percent of crimes, Meh1234 leaves out the fact that a large percentage of those crimes are drug-related arrests, and even though whites use drugs at about the same rate, blacks are 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for them. But who\u2019s counting? Obviously not Meh1234.\n\nI just want to confirm with all of you that I have notified the proper authorities and warned them that they should keep an eye on Yesha\u2019s black identity extremism. After they laughed me off the phone, I decided to keep a dossier myself. I\u2019m updating it every day, since no one else will.\n\nDespite the fact that Yesha has never killed a black boy in cold blood and walked away scot-free; even though she has never denied anyone employment or housing because of their race; in spite of the fact that she didn\u2019t create an unequal education, political or criminal-justice system, the fact that she wrote about a white woman who is willing to take handouts on the internet while vilifying black people just because it\u2019s actually her job to do that is no excuse. Yesha and her highfalutin words are the real racists. I see it now. Thanks, guys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for Yesha sullying innocent little Keaton, you are absolutely correct. Just because his mother is a racist and his father is a white supremacist doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Keaton will ... wait. Scratch that last point. I was about to use facts.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m watching her.\n\n[Also, I\u2019m not racist. I have white friends. I\u2019ve provided photographic evidence below. Ash\u00e9. \u2014Yesha]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis next letter comes from a Facebook user. I don\u2019t know specifically what he\u2019s talking about, but his rant was epic.

Black kids graduate high school. Black mothers graduate college and get married before you pop out 3 kids with 3 different men before you are 25. Black people are their own worst enemy. You are a pussy!! South Carolina , what a joke and yes us northerners make fun of people taking pics of snow dusting. What a clown!! Your nostrils stretch out to the center of your eyes. Not natural!! Plantation nigger, no doubt. That is right motherfucker, we never owned slaves. Totally different generation. A bunch of excuse makers who blame others for their races dysfunctions. Facts do not care about feelings asshole. You called Trump a racist but Obama gets a pass for having Al Sharpton as a close adviser and invited BLM to the White House. The double fucking standards. Black home ownership is the highest it has ever been under Trump. Keep drinking that Kool Aid.. Black people from the south might be the dumbest people ever. Simple mineed fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo hours later, when he received no response, he sent this:\n\nEqual rights comes with equal responsibility to respect the rights of those who do not agree with you. Guess who said that asshole. MLK!! Funny that Donald Trump did business in NYC for 40 years and he received awards from the NAACP and other groups and even Jesse Jackson praised his work on behalf of minorities, but he suddenly became a racist when he ran for president and sheep like you fall for it hook, line and sinker. It is like black people cant think with their ,and need the fake media to think for them. You are a sheep!!! So damn easily led.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear George,\n\nYou win. Your letter is unclapbackatable. You\u2019re right. Black fathers need to stop playing sperm donors. Black people need to get an education before having children. President Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House. I don\u2019t have a mirror in front of me right now, but my nose might actually stretch to the center of my eyes.\n\nYou are correct. By your definition of racism, neither you nor Donald Trump is a racist. You win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Kevin G\n\nTo: The Root I have been reading Jalopnik and Gizmodo for years. Recently your other articles from Kinja assets have been showing titles linking to racist articles. \u201c10 types of useless white people\u201d \u201cWhite people need to be better people\u201d And many more. I know you don\u2019t care about my opinion as a white person, but if the race of these articles were switched to any other race, YOUR teams would be shouting racism. I\u2019m sure you do this to get clicks and views, but I will no longer read anything published by your media company and it\u2019s support of racism. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nNo, Kevin!\n\nDon\u2019t go. I\u2019m begging you. Please stay. On behalf of all of the employees at The Root, I\u2019d like to offer my sincerest apologies. I had no idea we were assaulting your delicate sensibilities with our anti-white commentary. Trust me, we are ashamed of ourselves. In our Wednesday staff meeting, we often worry about the content of our site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe live with constant concern about the flimsiness of the one-ply, Dollar Tree toilet-paper thickness of white skin. But now we understand the one thing we overlooked and the reason we have received so many complaints:\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read.\n\nCaucasian illiteracy is a growing problem in America that The Root has vowed to eliminate. After seeing the grammar and spelling in our hate mail, we realize these aren\u2019t isolated incidents; it\u2019s a national crisis equal only to the opioid epidemic, Chicago gun violence and when retail employees don\u2019t listen to a white woman who was obviously \u201ctold by AppleCare ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow we understand that Caucasians can\u2019t quite read the posts we write about homophobia in the black community, crime and misogyny. Now we fully see that when we criticize women like Tomi Lahren, Taylor Swift and former Officer Betty Shelby, we\u2019re being racist. But when we condemn people like Omarosa, Chrisette Michele or Arizona Police Officer Philip \u201cMitch\u201d Brailsford, who shot Daniel Shaver in cold blood, apparently white people can\u2019t read those articles.\n\nWhen we called out Ray Rice for his anti-anthem stance, Lil Wayne for his anti-Black Lives Matter comments, Migos for homophobia, Steve Harvey for joking about the Flint, Mich., water crisis, Sheriff David Clarke for the murders in his prison or Ben Carson for his support of Donald Trump, our fairer-skinned brethren didn\u2019t quite have the requisite level of reading comprehension to enjoy those pieces. When I wrote about the culture of black male silence surrounding sexual assault, I should have done it phonetically. And apparently, Damon Young\u2019s viral piece \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d was too filled with words for our white audience.\n\nWe\u2019re going to change this, Kevin. Not just for you but for all of our white audience that accuses us of racism. I know you must be correct in your assessment of The Root because if not, it could only mean that you are being willfully ignorant and would rather call us racists than admit that there is a possibility that you pay attention only to things that confirm your own biases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you\u2019d never do that, Kevin.\n\nI just want you to stay. We\u2019ll do better, Kevin. I promise. Don\u2019t leave us. We are going to miss your one or two page views per week. We might have to close up shop.

Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me. I don\u2019t hate dogs.\n\nBut I know they all have teeth.", "keywords": ["feel", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "unanswered", "white", "know", "black", "dogs", "im", "questions", "reverse", "mailbag", "dont", "race"], "polarity": 0.019458046194687433, "subjectivity": 0.41400055203490305},

Instead of clapping back at the people who send emails, tweets and direct messages, we would like to thank our haters, because without them, where would we be?\n\nAs you sit back munching on your leftover dressing and sweet-potato-pie sandwich (don\u2019t judge me; I\u2019m just trying to eliminate waste by recycling), remember that whatever you do in life, if you don\u2019t have haters, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet us commence with the clapping:\n\nOur first correspondences this week refer to a story we recently published about Nazi furries. The community of furries (not to be confused with the furry community\u2014people with an excessive amount of back hair) was very upset about our post on the trend of alt-right anthropomorphic cosplayers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Buddy\n\nTo: The Root Tips First off spreading lies about something you have little to no information about, and using a photo completely out of context, On of the suiters is a partially deaf gay man, there is just as much Nazi propaganda in the furry community and there is in a loaf of bread. This is why only certain news outlets grow enough to recognised, they don\u2019t lie nor spread rumor to get attenchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Furries:\n\nFirst, allow me to thank you for reaching out to me. I am delighted to share this open dialogue with you and your community. I hope The Root can become a place where people of all costumes can come together and exist in unity, no matter their fur or made-up species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I would like to say that, as an equal opportunity site, we would never limit people from doing what they believe. As such, I want to clarify our belief that the phenomenon of \u201cwhite-people shit\u201d is not limited to people of the Caucasian persuasion. Yes, a nonwhite gay man can, indeed, participate in white-people shit.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the term was not coined to besmirch the activities enjoyed by taupe Americans. It was meant to praise their imagination, unfettered by the fear of being marginalized or categorized. Our wish for humanity is that we all, one day, can enjoy the privilege of participating in white-people shit.\n\nI do, however, object to your belief that having sex with a black man means that you cannot be a racist. History is filled with examples to the contrary. Slaveholders routinely had sex with slaves while upholding the tenets of white supremacy. There are many incidents of white women who had consensual sex with black men and then pointed lynch mobs in the direction of their lovers. Racism and interracial sex are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, on the other hand, uphold your right to have sex with whomever you choose. Whether it be a black man or a fuchsia fox wearing a Nazi-inspired armband, if you like it, I love it.\n\nJust remember to use protection. I don\u2019t want you to get rabies.\n\nFrom: Chantel\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I read your article on Black Thanksgiving. I love your writing, but would like you to know that not everything is about race.Stuff like Thanksgiving is universal. Your aritcles about black thanksgiving is so similar to white thanksgiving. We might not eat the same kind of food, and our relatives might be slightly diferent in the way we treat each other, but everything els is exactly alike. I am white, but I recognized almost everything in your article. If The only difference in me and you is what we call our aunts and how we like our macarone, then we might not be so different afger all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Chantel,\n\nYou might want to look up the definition of the words \u201cexactly alike.\u201d\n\nThanks.\n\nFrom: Bill S.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Hello Michael, I\u2019d like to apologize for contracting you on your personal email address.\n\nTried to find a method of contact on the site, but an email address for writing submissions was all I could find in the way of contact. I also posted this in reply to your last Clapback posting, but I\u2019m a member of the Greys and with a last name like S., Ill likely never not be on The Root. Ok let\u2019s get to my application.\n\nI think I have finally figured out what irks me about your writing Michael. Well actually I shouldn\u2019t say writing, as you are a damn fine writer. I guess I should say, the content in your writing.\n\nI\u2019m not poor ol Dusty from the last set of clapbacks, and Im not gonna get offended by comments that you make. I\u2019m honestly too damn busy trying to pay my bills every month to get riled by an internet comment.\n\nWith that said, I think the issue I have with your writing is that you\u2019re coming across as just another provocateur, in what seems like an ever growing sea of provocateurs. A provocateur as I see it, only serves one purpose, and that\u2019s to stir the pot. Honestly I dont have any problem with stirring the pot, because that needs to happen from time to time, and it would seem it needs to happen often when it comes to social issues. The problem with provocateurs is that they never stop stirring for long enough for the change they provocate for to actually take place.\n\nNow obviously Im not saying that if you stop now, all of a sudden all of the racist bullshit out there is instantly going to vanish. That obviously does not hinge on your writing. What I am saying is that I wish the provocative nature of your writing could take a back seat more often now that the site has a pretty good base. I wish there was more writing on here about ideas to bring about change now that you have a voice with a platform and base that will hear you.\n\nYou can keep writing about the evils of Whitey till the sun burns out, and we both know it will continue to work from a blogging perspective. What it does not do however, is make a damn bit of difference. You and I are both now old enough to recognise that pointing out a wrong and getting people to recognize said wrong, does not mean that the wrong will be righted. I swear, if I hear one more god damn millennial say \u201cyou need to recognize...\u201d, I\u2019m going to lose my goddamn mind. As if their generation is the first to be cognisant of racial and social injustices, or that the simple recognition of those injustices will fix anything.\n\nWe now have roughly 3 generations of people that were brought up to recognise racial and social injustice. I think its safe to say that we have the numbers to bring on some level of change. Continuing to to simply ask for recognition at this point is about as useless as poor ol Dusty comment to you.\n\nI want to be clear that I am not trying to tell you what you should be doing with regard to your writing. I am trying to voice what I wish you and the rest of the writers at The Root would do more often. As I see it you can be content with being Flavor Flav, or you can be Public Enemy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill,\n\nThank you for finally enlightening me on this subject.\n\nI have received a million letters like yours, but you, in your eloquence, finally solved a puzzle that I have been unable to decipher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am often asked this question or presented with this argument in various forms. Some of the most popular are:\n\nWhy must you always talk about racism all the time?\n\n\n\nWhy not offer solutions?\n\n\n\nTalking about race and prejudice only leads to more divisiveness.\n\n\n\nBut you\u2019ve figured it out for me, Bill. Because of your letter, I finally understand:\n\nWhite people have amnesia.\n\nYou\u2019re partially right, Bill: I often point the finger at white people when it comes to racism. But the idea that I or any writer at The Root never speaks about solutions is either a blatant attempt to ignore the facts or a goddamn lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will not call you a liar, Billy.\n\nBut if you are not a liar, then you are either stupid or you have a strain of forgetfulness I like to call sudden-onset Caucasian amnesia. Let\u2019s examine the facts:\n\nWhen I, or other writers, talk about the blatant, systematic racism in the criminal-justice system, white people accuse us of \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and not offering solutions. Either they are making the argument up, or white people\u2019s Wi-Fi can\u2019t download the incessant number of articles I and others writers here have written about how to change the criminal-justice system by voting, electing local prosecutors, getting engaged in activism, reorganizing the bail system and organizing communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to Change the World We are so often overwhelmed with complex issues and bad news that it is easy to forget the impact\u2026 Read more Read\n\nWhen we talk about education disparities, apparently you skipped by the posts about HBCUs, reforming school districts or community-based education projects. We tried to make it simple for your white mind, Bill, by highlighting our list of black children excelling in education with our Young Futurists series. We put it on our banner. We shone a light on them. Perhaps you aren\u2019t an overly sensitive snowflake crying every time you see the word \u201cwhite people\u201d on a black site. Maybe you just missed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we talk about police violence, we offer solutions. When we discuss mass incarceration, we talk about ideas. We have written articles specifically aimed at white people who want to combat white supremacy.\n\nIn fact, there is not one single subject we have tackled here at The Root for which we have not addressed our own community about solving the problem among ourselves, whether it is inner-city crime, gang violence or bringing our own seasoning to white gatherings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour letter reminds me of the people who are anti-Black Lives Matter. Anyone who has ever lived in a black neighborhood will tell you that for every #BlackLivesMatter march, there are 10 Stop the Violence rallies. But Fox News never shows up at those events. Media outlets don\u2019t give them publicity, but they will point the camera at any white face willing to ask, \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nEvery single day this place focuses on black excellence and highlights those who are engaged in eliminating white supremacy. We have criticized both black and white alike. If you don\u2019t see it, it\u2019s because you have chosen to remain willfully ignorant.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re a goddamn liar.", "keywords": ["say", "writing", "clapback", "roots", "white", "im", "root", "talk", "dont", "thanksgiving", "mailbag", "black", "sex"], "polarity": 0.0361974573780129, "subjectivity": 0.4478799235743681},

In fact, he\u2019s a pathological liar with a history of lying and then just nonchalantly acting as if what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t lying.\n\n\n\nDuring one stretch from Jan 21. to Feb. 27, the New York Times found that the president lied publicly some 38 times. He lied about not being a fan of the Iraq War, which he totally was. He lied about how many times he appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover; he claimed that he\u2019d been on the cover more than anyone else, but turns out he\u2019d been on the cover 15 times and former President Richard Nixon had appeared 55 times. He even lied about about two people getting shot in Chicago the same day President Barack Obama was in town making a speech; reports confirmed that no one was shot the day Obama delivered his speech.\n\nTrump lies; it\u2019s just what he does. While his lies are easily disproved, it\u2019s rare that he will readily admit that he lied, much less admit it to another world leader. The Washington Post got its hands on a fundraising speech Trump made Wednesday in which he openly admitted to making up claims during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He just randomly spouted that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada without even knowing whether that was true.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post breaks down the audio of Trump speaking during a private event:\n\n\u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau. [...] \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c ... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. \u2026 And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, in that case, I feel differently,\u2019 I said, \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u2018Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 \u2018Well, sir, you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. \u2026 And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. It reports that in 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump\u2019s a notorious liar who actually believes his own lies, he took to Twitter on Thursday to double down on his totally false and made-up accusation.\n\nBruce Heyman, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2017, blasted Trump over his remarks, tweeting that the president was \u201ccreating a crisis where none existed,\u201d USA Today reports: \u201cLying to your friends only hurts the relationship. Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you casually damage this realtionship [sic]? Shame on you!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tape obtained by the Post, Trump attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement, reached by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is currently being renegotiated. And he openly mocked other politicians for wanting to keep NAFTA. He called Mexico \u201cspoiled\u201d and added that Canada had outsmarted the United States. \u201cThe best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,\u201d he said, according to USA Today.\n\nClearly, Trump doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works.

(Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Operation Smile) 1 / 21\n\nIf ever the term \u201chair journey\u201d applied, it would be DaCosta\u2019s, albeit an entirely natural one. From a high schooler once given the superlative of \u201cmost hairstyles in one year\u201d to a college co-ed visible across campus rocking a big \u2019fro before natural hair was back in fashion, she\u2019s consistently followed her own instincts when it comes to her crown and is happy to see other women doing the same:\n\nYou know, obviously we have pictures of some of our moms, or aunts or grandmothers in the \u201970s with Afros. But there was a long time when natural hair was not accepted. And so it\u2019s really great for me to see this\u2014I guess it\u2019s being called a \u201cmovement\u201d\u2014women just learning how to care for what comes out of their heads. And it\u2019s nice to have people feel like they have more options, you know? Because we can always do what we want to do, or what we feel comfortable doing\u2014whether it\u2019s a weave or it\u2019s a perm or anything else. But it\u2019s when we don\u2019t feel like we have an option that it becomes a problem; when it then becomes a societal issue, rather than a personal decision. But there\u2019s a cult mentality that\u2019s crept into the movement that I\u2019m not really supportive of. I think it has a lot to do with something that happens when people convert to a lot of things. It\u2019s always the recent converts\u2014whether it be religious dogma or philosophy or anything else\u2014that tend to be really extreme. I live in a little less of an extreme world, in my personal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, even her decision to crop her famous locks was initially met with more opposition than support. But after years of joking about taking the leap, DaCosta ultimately took the decision in stride: \u201cI was walking down the street, and as crazy as this may sound, I heard a voice\u2014maybe it was my own inner voice or higher self\u2014just say, \u2018Cut your hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter considering it late into the night, she lit some candles, sat down in front of her computer and recorded a conversation with herself, contemplating all of the things she would be releasing by cutting her hair:\n\nAnd when I tell you, after childbirth, that was the most powerful experience of my life. I cried, I hugged and kissed myself; it was amazing. And I never looked back. I always thought when people do that, the next day they wake up, like, \u201cOh my God, what did I do? I ruined my life.\u201d I didn\u2019t. I felt good about it. ... There\u2019s so much that has happened since [then] that I know would not have been possible had I been weighed down by the weight that I was carrying; the toxic relationships, other people\u2019s expectations of me, safety, hiding, not feeling beautiful without it. ... One of the things that I cut off as well was fear, and in doing so, realized how guided I was, not by love or confidence, but fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence is an issue DaCosta confesses to having struggled with in younger years. She recalls an experience early on in her professional acting career, when her father presented her with a unique challenge:\n\nHe goes, \u201cI just have one question: \u2018Where does your confidence come from?\u2019 Don\u2019t answer now\u2014just think about it\u201d ... I think that that was\u2014it was an invitation to step into the answer, to figure out what it was. And it\u2019s something that I guess is from life, when you\u2019re ready to come into yourself. And it can\u2019t be forced and it can\u2019t be faked. And you know, it\u2019s amazing having all these mirrors around me now, and people, and relationships, and just seeing how the types of people coming into my life now are different. And I\u2019m so inspired by them, and they\u2019re a reflection of the work that I\u2019ve been doing to answer that question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while DaCosta has every intention of growing her hair back\u2014healthier and with new energy and genuine confidence\u2014taking the risk has come back to reward her tenfold, especially as she becomes more aware of the impact her image has had on others:", "keywords": ["natural", "life", "know", "2015", "premiere", "growth", "yaya", "chop", "big", "2016", "chicago", "meds", "images", "talks", "dacosta", "hair", "growing", "teamnatural"], "polarity": 0.1759024490002751, "subjectivity": 0.5000853454114325},

I\u2019ve been asked that question a million times (I\u2019m bad at math). But I thought we should take some time to explore this question.\n\nIt might give our readers some insight into why we choose to jab back at those who send us hate mail, insulting tweets and ugly comments. It might help you understand why The Root started this weekly tradition. But mostly because Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan makes me write these introductions every week [Hey, Harriot, I see you talking about me because I\u2019m editing this. Introductions are important! \u2014Yesha].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was 11 years old, a bully named Jamaal was about to beat up one of my friends when Jamaal tripped and fell on the sidewalk. I quickly quipped, \u201cThat nigga Jamaal be tripping,\u201d and everyone burst into laughter.\n\nJamaal got in my face and kindly informed me that he was going to kick my ass. Scared, I ran home and hid in the house. My mother saw the fear in my eyes, and do you know what she did? She grabbed me by my collar and said: \u201cAight. I mean ... Jamaal is pretty big.\u201d\n\nThe next day, no one remembered me running home like a scared rat, but they remembered that joke I said about Jamaal. That\u2019s when I realized: A smart, witty retort is even better than kicking someone\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, that story is 100 percent fake. The following emails are 100 percent real. Blame Yesha.\n\n[Thank you; that was a good fable/introduction. \u2014Yesha]\n\nThe following is a direct message from a Twitter user named P0lymorphic:\n\n\n\nFrom: P0lymorphic\n\nTo: Michael Harriot You are aware hate crimes apply to all people. Not just people of color. https://www.theroot.com/when-the-irish-weren-t-white-1793358754 \u2026 this article is offensive, remove it or I\u2019ll call your local pd and file a complaint for hate crimes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear P0lymorphic,\n\nI rarely do this, but I am reaching out to you because I am confused. A few weeks ago we published an article about Nazi furries that engendered a furtwa against me. Every day since, I have received hate mail from people who like to dress up as magenta German shepherds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can see that your Twitter bio picture is some kind of animal in a Nazi uniform. Because of the past few weeks, that\u2019s not so weird. The crazy part is this: In your direct message accusing me of a \u201chate crime,\u201d you never mentioned furries, the alt-right furry article or anything about your polymorphism!\n\nThis leaves me with some questions for you, P0lymorphic. I hope you can provide some clear answers:\n\n\n\nWhy are you dressed up like an alt-right golden retriever? Look, I get it, we all have our preferences. I am not a human supremacist. I feel like blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians and people who want to walk around like the love child of Sonic the Hedgehog and a Teletubbie all deserve the same rights. What puzzles me is why you want to marginalize others. Who are you specifically against? Black bears? Do you want to build a wall to keep out the chihuahuas coming here to take your furry jobs? Are you Homo (sapiens) phobic?\n\nAre you Irish? The link you provided is to an article about the false notion that the Irish were slaves. Was that a mistake, or are you willing to forgive me for making fun of your predilection for polymorphism, but the fact that I wrote about the Irish upsets you? What are you going to tell the police? When they come to your home to answer the complaint, will you be wearing your SS-officer fox outfit? Are you going to ... wait. I think I just figured it out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re trying to fuck a police dog, aren\u2019t you, P0lymorphic? You\u2019re using my splendid name to lure an unsuspecting K-9 officer to your home so you can make sweet love to another animal in uniform.\n\nI refuse to be a part of your sick games, P0lymorphic. I see through your little ruse. Shame on you!\n\nThe next message is from the comment section for Monique Judge\u2019s article about why emotional maturity and emotional intelligence are important in healthy relationships:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear AluNoir:\n\nMonique\u2019s definitions of emotional intelligence and emotional maturity come directly from psychological definitions, specifically, Psychology Today. But it brings up a greater point about a subject we need to discuss: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very emotionally intelligent or mature, AluNoir. I have never met you personally, so I am basing my conjecture on one theory:\n\nHit dogs.\n\nThere is an old Southern saying that goes, \u201cA hit dog will holler,\u201d meaning that when you say or do something to a group of people, the one who is offended will let it be known. This happens often at The Root. Allow me to present you with another recent example:\n\nThis week I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could easily find 10 comments that objected to the article, but I think the easiest way would be to just post this letter (that\u2019s right, you are about to see a clapback inside a clapback. That\u2019s some Inception-level shit):\n\nFrom: Kristi Z\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Michael, it\u2019s hard to understand how you could write an article about Trump calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas being racist and then call all white women Beckies. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s just as bad? Using your logic, if Trump using a traditional native American name as a slur means he hates Indians, does this means you hate all women? I can tell youdo but I want to hear you say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluNoir, Kristi is a Becky.\n\nShe makes a good point that, all things being equal, calling a woman \u201cPocahontas\u201d is the same as calling a white woman a \u201cBecky.\u201d But here is the thing\u2014and I\u2019m going to type it in all caps, which, in internet parlance, means I am yelling. Because I am about to yell:\n\nALL THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL!\n\nThat is the entire point of the term \u201cBecky.\u201d That is the entire point of the term \u201cwypipo.\u201d If the infinitely small dig of \u201cBecky\u201d and \u201cwypipo\u201d upsets you, then imagine how white supremacy must feel. Imagine how being labeled a \u201cthug\u201d feels. Or \u201cunderprivileged.\u201d Or \u201curban.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most important (here is where I tie the point up in a neat little bow), anyone who objects to the the truth of a psychological definition or a hackneyed joke of a quiz is probably a hit dog.\n\nAluNoir thinks that Monique must be living in an alternate reality because she believes in psychology. AluNoir believes that anyone who uses the actual definition of a term is delusional. AluNoir is emotionally unintelligent and emotionally immature. Alu Noir is a hit dog.\n\nJust like Kristi. Kristi literally believes that anyone who makes a joke about white women must obviously hate all women. According to Kristi, that is the only possible explanation. I mean ... who could possibly dislike white women, with their entitled attitudes and their credit-card-shaped buttocks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Kristi\u2019s standards, either I\u2019m a hater or there are people on this earth who actually believe that there are some white women whose entire existence is predicated on their privilege. Kristi can\u2019t fathom that it could possibly be the former, so it must be the latter. Kristi is a hit dog. Kristi is a Becky.\n\nI beg of you, AuNoir ...\n\nDon\u2019t be like Kristi.\n\nThe next letter is an email to one of our female writers. I have concealed her name in case there are others out there like this:\n\n\n\nFrom: Ron E.\n\nSubject: Your worn panties Would it be possible for you to sell me your worn panties? Please let me know.\n\nThank you kindly. XOXOX Ron\n\nDear Ron,\n\nFirst of all, I am jealous. I have been writing for The Root for quite a while and no one has solicited a pair of my boxers. Even though I am disappointed, I will let it go so that I can bring up another salient point:\n\nWhy, though?\n\nWhy do you want a pair of panties? More important, what endows you with the confidence to ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have often wondered how men like Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein and Mark Halperin would think that a woman would want to see them masturbate. How could they pose questions like, \u201cYou wanna see me wash my bloated, fluorescent dad bod in the shower or watch me manhandle my penis like a bicycle pump?\u201d I have come up with a theory:\n\nIt works.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that these middle-aged men would continue to ask women these obscene questions if no one, at some point, said yes. Human nature doesn\u2019t work that way. Therefore, I have come up with a solution I call the \u201cThanksgiving rule.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are a man, every Thanksgiving, you should gather your aunts, sisters, mother and grandmother in a room and reveal your sexual proclivities. Tell them, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a woman who likes when a man grabs her breasts without asking.\u201d Ask them if they know a nice girl at their church who might be looking for a guy to furiously masturbate into their house plant.\n\nIf they look disgusted or throw mashed potatoes in your face, take that as a sign that you shouldn\u2019t do it to strangers. If you can\u2019t do it at home, don\u2019t do it in public.\n\nI think I just solved the entire sexual-misconduct crisis. That\u2019s what the mailbag is here for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["hate", "point", "wypipo", "clapback", "thats", "roots", "women", "white", "article", "tripping", "jamaal", "think", "mailbag", "kristi", "important"], "polarity": -0.0044653880070546735, "subjectivity": 0.49038800705467367},

First, I would like to apologize to the readers who trusted me to bring them the latest and best clapbacks of the week. Next, I want to issue my deepest regrets to all the idiots, racists and people with generally bad grammar who feel ignored. I have failed you.\n\nThis week, through the magic of the great technical team at Fusion Media Group, I discovered that I have overlooked some of you for far too long. I discovered that I have whole-ass accounts to which fans have been sending tons of messages hate mail. First I received a notification to check my company email, to which I replied: \u201cI have company email?\u201d\n\nWhile explaining how to access this alleged email account (\u201calleged\u201d means that you don\u2019t have to believe in something\u2014even if it actually exists, correct? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s right), the \u201cengineer\u201d (I prefer to call them \u201cscience magicians\u201d*) joked that I missed out on these emails like people miss out on their filtered-Facebook-message inbox.\n\nAgain, I said, \u201cWhatchootalmboutwillis?\u201d\n\nThe 20-something didn\u2019t get the joke, proving that inane trivia about \u201980s sitcoms is far more important than useless bullshit like algebra and information technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*Seriously, I think all engineers know magic. The only other explanation is that they know math, science and how computers actually work, and there\u2019s no way I believe that bullshit. It\u2019s literally impossible. Next you\u2019ll be trying to convince me to believe in bullshit like unicorns, Bigfoot, climate change and evolution.\n\nYeah, right.\n\nAnyway, here are the clapbacks we have missed because I never learned the correct spells and incantations necessary to conjure up computer stuff (that\u2019s the technical term, I think).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Ray O.\n\nTo: Anne Branigin\n\nSubject: Too Many Commies In This Country You sound like a stupid, commie bi#@#h that simply repeats what she heard from her indoctrinated professors . To think colleges and universities used to be institutions of higher education. The insults you throw at the president of the United States and other politicians simply demonstrates that you graduated from kindergarten (maybe) and have no respect for this country. Please return to Iran or Yemen or whatever \u201craghead\u201d country you probably still call home. Do not pass \u201cgo\u201d, do not collect your passport, you won\u2019t need it any longer. The true Americans don\u2019t want you here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks for your reply, Ray. It\u2019s obvious that you and I are kindred spirits. While I love Anne, I, too, think she far too often writes about issues and news with a bias toward that nonsense people learn in college. I have spoken with her privately about using things like facts, scientific studies and research. She will never get anywhere in life doing that.\n\nDuring our impromptu counseling sessions, I\u2019ve told her that if she wants to be a \u201ctrue American\u201d like you, she must learn to get the truth from the one place where all real Americans find it: their guts.\n\nBut I could tell she was confused. See, Anne can\u2019t shake free from the indoctrination she received by getting an actual master\u2019s degree in journalism and instead adhere to the journalistic integrity of random yahoos who email her to tell her to go back to countries she\u2019s not from. You see, Anne has not come to the realization that there is a difference between \u201cthe truth\u201d and \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has yet to comprehend the fact that we live in a post-truth society where one can deny climate change because it feels colder, or white people can grab tiki torches and commit acts of terror because they feel oppressed. I continue to work with Anne on this, but there\u2019s one other question that I\u2019d like to ask you:\n\nWhy did you feel the need to censor the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Did you think a woman would be OK with your calling her a \u201cstupid commie\u201d or a \u201craghead\u201d but then clutch her pearls when she read the word \u201cbitch\u201d? Are racism and xenophobia OK in your circle, but sexism is going too far? You\u2019re such a fucking gentleman, Ray.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to Anne and what it means to be a \u201ctrue American,\u201d because I don\u2019t know what that means. When your parents, grandparents or great-grandparents came to this country, did they not become \u201ctrue Americans\u201d? How long does it take? Must Anne do something like steal land, kidnap blacks, rape, commit genocide or write asterisk-laced racist diatribes to people she disagrees with before she gets an invitation into your club of lying, murdering, raping, reneging thieves?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m asking for a Native American friend.\n\nOh and one more thing:\n\nYour mama\u2019s a b***h.\n\nDon\u2019t be offended; I didn\u2019t type it out. Plus, look at her son.\n\nHey man, that\u2019s just \u201cmy truth.\u201d\n\nThe next message was found in the hidden double-secret, filtered-message inbox:\n\nFrom: Shane G. Hey Michael, The things you are sharing are inappropriate and should not be on Facebook. Please take them down. You are a dumb prick who writes bullshit articles on a back ally site Also go fuck ya mother and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGotdammit, Shane!\n\nI wish I had gotten this message before I had that threesome with your mother and Ray O\u2019s! Now I\u2019m pretty much done with mother-fucking for the year.\n\nI blame Obama.\n\nP.S. This is just a joke. I don\u2019t want to be sued for slander or libel. Despite her numerous pleas, I have never had sexual intercourse with your mother. Plus, I would never insert my penis into the dry, wrinkled hole that gave life to anything like you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Jo\n\nSubject: No longer following NFL\n\nTo: Stephen Crocket Obviously that is a lie. Starting with a lie is a bad foundation. I am positive you never served your country in any way shape or form as Mr. Kaep has also not served. Also I am sure you will not allow me to tell you how to spend your money. Just as you can not tell any NFL owner how to spend theirs. NFL owners do not have to put out a good product because it is not necessary for them to do so to make millions. They have blind follows. It is always about money. I do not watch The NFL nor do I support what they stand for because starting from the owners, coaches and players they are all over paid for whatever skill,or talent people feel they have there by creating all this ego and false value. Just like writers like yourself and those you work with who continually spew out their praises. I understand Mr Kaep\u2019s cause and realize it is a worthy one but he should have picked a different a venue to express himself. Get a life and write about something else. Oh yes try to tell the truth a forgotten area in your chosen profession\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Jo,\n\nThank you for your service. (I don\u2019t know if you have ever served in the military\u2014I\u2019m talking about your service to whiteness.)\n\nHere\u2019s a surprise: I actually agree with you. You have every right to disagree with the Colin Kaepernick protest. It is supposed to upset you. That is the point of a protest. However ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat does not mean anyone has to give a fuck.\n\nDo you think Rosa Parks gave a fuck about the people who were going to be late on that Montgomery, Ala., bus? I bet Harriet Tubman never considered the slave owners\u2019 financial losses; nor did civil rights workers worry about the people who wanted to sit down and eat their grilled-cheese sandwiches at segregated lunch counters. When state troopers cracked John Lewis\u2019 skull open on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., I\u2019m sure, as he faded into darkness, that there is one thought that never crossed his mind:\n\n\u201cDamn, this is really going to screw up traffic.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry that you wish Kaepernick had picked a different venue to protest. The next time a black mother is crying over the body of her son as the blood spills onto the concrete from the bullet piercings, I will be sure to send her a note asking:\n\n\u201cCan you pick a different venue to mourn?\u201d\n\nOne year ago this week, I was asked to mediate a microscopic difference of opinion (it wasn\u2019t really a beef) about the film The Birth of a Nation after a prominent news anchor (Roland Martin) disagreed with a writer at The Root (Yesha Callahan) who said that the film was a flop, saying that she was dancing on the film\u2019s grave. His comments resembled the sentiments of many black men that black feminists had doomed the movie, so I wrote this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter that piece was published, I received a lot of backlash, including this voice message, which is exactly 1 year old today. For the first time ever, I now present to you a video clapback:\n\nScience, bruh.", "keywords": ["clapback", "mother", "roots", "know", "old", "bringing", "im", "tell", "sure", "dont", "country", "true", "think", "mailbag", "anne", "stuff"], "polarity": 0.04178911366411367, "subjectivity": 0.4995208957708959},

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["saying", "evil", "job", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "blacks", "way", "welfare", "mailbags", "think", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings. I miss the safe space of being surrounded by women laughing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI miss my friend.", "keywords": ["natural", "shes", "surviving", "know", "women", "breakup", "miss", "woman", "lenelle", "hairdresser", "weeks", "missed", "hair", "black", "going", "ive"], "polarity": 0.06577585377585381, "subjectivity": 0.4640754208754209},

The Root\u2019s staff is going to kill me for revealing this top secret information, but in the spirit of openness and honesty, I feel it needs to be said, so here goes:\n\nNot everyone hates us.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to believe. I can\u2019t believe it myself. The truth is, although we receive a ton of hate mail, tweets, messages and email (which is totally different from hate mail\u2014some people actually take the time to mail us letters, with stamps and everything!)\u2014the vast majority of the correspondence we receive is from readers thanking us for the stories we write.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of it is critical, but for every person clapped back at in this weekly segment, there are at least three or four people whom I and other writers here contact privately and have meaningful, fruitful discussions with.\n\nI know you\u2019re thinking: \u201cIs Michael getting soft on us? Is he trying to remake the mailbag into a touchy-feely bucket of hugs and kisses?\u201d\n\nNah, don\u2019t worry about that. There is still more hate than we can handle. I simply thought there was a need to place the clapbacks into proper perspective. We aren\u2019t overly sensitive to criticism; we actually like it. I just wanted you to know: I don\u2019t always clap back ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when I do, it\u2019s in the Clapback Mailbag.\n\nThe following messages are regarding the debate about NFL players selling out the anthem protests written by Senior Editor Stephen A. Crockett Jr. and me:\n\nFrom: Peanut the Stepchild\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You aint shit I read your article calling Malcolm Jenkins a sellout. What i need to know is how is he a sellout? He got $100 millions ofdollars for black causes? That money will help alot of people. Maybe you\u2019re the sellout. I know you\u2019re an Omega, as is he. How could you sell your frat brother out for clicks? What I\u2019d like to know is: what are you doing for black people besides bitching on the internet. It is brothers like you who criticize your own people that keep us down, not Malcolm Jenkins who is trying to solve the problem. Maybe if you get off your ass and do something he wouldn\u2019t have to \u201csell us out\u201d as you call it. Coons like you are the worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this direct message from Twitter:\n\nFrom: DamnDamnDamnJames I liked your argument about the NFL players alot. I\u2019m #teammicheal on this one. Niggas like Stephen Crockett should just die so real niggas can actually make some moves. Don\u2019t fuck with that nigga. Porch monkeys like him will sell you out like he thinks the players should sell out. Keep doint your thing black man.\n\nHey, James, calm down. As far as the NFL players are concerned, Stephen and I are in agreement: The players shouldn\u2019t have taken the money. I don\u2019t understand how they even came to that conclusion. When I initially found out about it, I contacted Stephen (because he is our sports editor) and we had a long conversation about it into the wee hours of the night. Actually, it was about 11 p.m., but still.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of us were conflicted on the subject, and we thought the best way to enunciate both sides of the issue was to pick a side and debate it. Stephen just lost the coin flip. In truth, Stephen asked me which side I wanted to write because he knew he was good enough to write either side. That shit kinda threw me off for a minute, like when a dude smiles and nicely invites you outside to fight.\n\nAnd Peanut (may I call you Peanut, or is it Mr. Stepchild?), what the hell will $100 million do for injustice and inequality? Here\u2019s what you should do: Call Sybrina Fulton and ask her how much it would take for her to stop crying at the image of her son in a casket. Ask Michael Brown Sr. if it would have made everything OK if Darren Wilson had written him a check before pumping bullets into his son\u2019s body.\n\nNot everything is for sale. The only people who think like that are broke motherfuckers and white people. However, I don\u2019t blame you or the owners. Both of you fit into one of those two categories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore I close, I would like to recommend that both of you come up with better slurs. In this new age of white supremacy, \u201cporch monkey\u201d and \u201ccoon\u201d are so pedestrian. I think you can do better. How about \u201cmoon cricket\u201d? No one ever says \u201cmoon cricket\u201d anymore. Or better yet, I think the trendy new term \u201cdindu\u201d might fit even better. White people love it because\u2014as they say\u2014when black thugs are arrested, they always say, \u201cI dindu nuthin\u2019.\u201d\n\nFinally, I won\u2019t comment on the part about me criticizing my fraternity brother. When I criticize white people, white people call me racist. When I criticize black people, black people call me a sellout. But absolutely no one will call me a Kappa. I won\u2019t stand for it.\n\nDespite your passion, we take your criticism with a grain of salt. There is, however, one very important thing I wanted to point out about both of your messages that absolutely infuriated both Stephen and me:\n\n\u201cAlot\u201d is not a word.\n\nMany people were mad about the article explaining why Donald Trump was racist for using the name \u201cPocahontas\u201d as a slur.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this direct message from a friend of mine:\n\nFrom: Baby Team, there will be no outcry at all if President Obama had called her the same thing. I find it disingenuous on her part to claim Indian Heritage and then get mad when she is referred to by the name of an Indian heroine. IJS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Dawn, LoDuv and Baby,\n\nMy article was not about the hypocrisy of Elizabeth Warren. She grates on my nerve simply because she talks like a kindergarten teacher trying to show you how to write a cursive letter \u201cB,\u201d but that was not the point of this piece.\n\nI can\u2019t get mad at Elizabeth Warren when I know at least 137 black people who say they have \u201cIndian\u201d in them with no proof except what their grandparents or parents told them. Plus, they have a good grade of hair, so they must be Cherokee. I was writing about the slur, not Warren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for the claim that Warren uses Pocahontas.com, someone else did that. Anyone can redirect traffic to a site. In fact, I might forward all tweets from Dawn and LoDuv to StupidMotherFuckersWhoComeAtMeOnTwitter.com.\n\nLet me check to see if the domain name is available.\n\nFrom: Che\n\nTo: Michael H. I think you are funny, but I don\u2019t get why you coon for white people when you write. That thanksgiving writeup was funny, but it makes black people look bad. We are not a monolith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChe,\n\nYou could\u2019ve stopped at \u201cThat thanksgiving writeup was funny.\u201d I understand how some think it reduces us to a stereotype. I try not to do that, but some things are true. White people make worse potato salad. Black people like sweet potato pie. I am often criticized for using black tropes because of something I like to call \u201clow black esteem.\u201d\n\nLow black esteem is a term I coined to explain when black people feel the need to polish the black parts of themselves to make themselves palatable for white people. We won\u2019t eat fried chicken in public. We cut watermelon into cubes. We code-switch. We turn the volume down on our blackness, not because white people will be offended, but because we want to be simply seen as human. Colorless. Like them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is the thing, Che:\n\nI am not like them.\n\nI do not feel the need to filter my blackness with a soft lens or hide it behind the gossamer curtain of respectability. Here is the premise of the \u201cCaucasian Guides\u201d and every joke I tell: We are not different. They are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have low black esteem. I believe our culture, and black people in general, to be the standard upon which everything is built (or stolen from). I don\u2019t talk \u201cblack.\u201d They talk white. I feel no need to suppress anything about myself, no matter how stereotypical it may seem.

It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t receive a lot of hate mail this week. (Don\u2019t worry; we won\u2019t ever run out of shitty comments from disgruntled readers of The Root\u2014ever). It\u2019s just that answering more than one piece of email this week would be redundant and stupid, and here is why:\n\nThis week we received the greatest piece of hate mail of all time.\n\nI don\u2019t like overhyping things. When guys, say, tell women they are going to \u201cmake you scream all night,\u201d they usually take the woman home, give her 4 minutes and 30 seconds of frantic \u201cWhose pussy is this?\u201d thrusting, followed by a deep slumber. That is not what we are doing here today.\n\nSometimes, for comic effect or to make a point, I will use hyperbole, but I\u2019m for real this time\u2014you about to read the whitest email ever written. It is not so much hate mail as it is white mail.\n\nOK, to be honest, it is pretty hateful, but it also embodies every piece of whiteness that has ever existed. It is a condensation of every microscopic molecule of Caucasianness. When I talk about \u201cwypipo,\u201d this is who I meant. We now have a mascot. The email is epic in its level of paleness and lack of melaninity. It is all the white things! When you read it, you will feel ...\n\nYou know what? Let\u2019s just read the letter.\n\nFrom: Nancy\n\nTo: Michael\n\nSubject: Your vile, sick, self deluded article Hey Michael Regarding your hateful rant about white people. If you think we are so bad you really need to go back to your African homeland where your own tribal leaders and ancestors pimped you for profit to jewish ship owners. Nothing to do with white europeans you despise so much. In Africa your honeland youll find they still never got civilized but there are cannibal warlords in Liberia. As Ben Carson said, a decent black man who excelled in a white mans world.\u201d the best thing that ever happen to the black man was slavery as it gave them the opportunity they would have never had in Africa\u201d you guys benefit from our civilization and our inventions. Cars, planes, trains, phones, electricity, tv, radio, archetecture. Roman and greek civlization is western civilization and Im sorry your ancestors are sad ass voo doo cannibals who never made a civlization.. Deal with it instead of hate and blame. Obama is a MuslIm which is very odd as Islam are the first to enslave your black ass. Go to Islam see what they still do to blacks today. So you should be thanking white men. We let you become millionairs in our society, Presidents, educated. Your complaining is vile and makes you unworthy. As far as crime. Lets face the facts. 40, 000 white women arr raped a year by black mren. White men dont rape black women. Wonder why? 300,000 black on white crimes a year. It is racial targeted hate. We cant help we are a beautiful intelligent race. But your acts of violence are transparent. We dont protest the way you people do as we have jobs. Not on welfare. In Japan during Fukishmi not one act of violence or looting. An honorable people. Katrina and other Us disaster its your breathen doing the looting not whites. It appears to me \u201cMichael\u201d sadly the name of a great warrior archangel you disgrace with your racial hate, jealosy, lies, and most import self delusions. What you are inciting with your so called \u201cpoetry\u201d is that of your voo doo ancestors demonic verbal diarrhea . Id like to look you in the eys and expel your bullshit out of you. Your a disgrace to humanity and ungrateful trash. Like your islamic Breathen foul and unholy Obama.You will fall from your throne of hate and deceit and lies soon enough by the wrath of God. May i suggest you go to church and pray rather than hating on white peopke and twisting the reality. You could never make a civlization absent us and now think your going to slander us the hijack and get unearned credit. Well try. When we fight back I assure you we will win as we always do since the history of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, Nancy,\n\nFirst of all, when you talk about my vile, racist rant against white people, it would be helpful if you pointed out which one. How am I supposed to know? That would be like going to a place where white people go (like Yankee Candle or wherever y\u2019all buy those Caucasian-fit jeans) and asking, \u201cMay I speak to a racist?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not why I selected your letter for mailbag honors. I chose this letter because I love you, Nancy. I want to meet you and marry you. I want you by my side for the rest of my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not for any romantic reasons, Nancy. My love for you is really selfish. From here to eternity, whenever I speak about racism, hate and the laughable fragility of wypipo and someone objects, I only wish that I would be able to say, \u201cHave you met my wife, Nancy?\u2019\n\nThe way your well-greased whiteness slid effortlessly from a \u201cGo back to Africa\u201d into a diatribe about black rapists, directly into a \u201cYou were better off as slaves,\u201d then transitioned into a lazy, welfare-nigga stereotype, may have been the most difficult combination of fucktastic bigotry I have ever witnessed on a page. I allowed David Duke to read your letter, and he was like, \u201cDamn, that bitch is racist!\u201d\n\nAnd where the fuck did the \u201cObama is a Muslim\u201d part come in? I gotta admit, Nancy, that shit came out of nowhere. It surprised me because I thought you were going in a whole different direction, but then you pivoted on me and wedged a little Islamophobia in there. And you prefaced it with a Ben Carson reference. And the subtle anti-Semitism of blaming slavery on the Jews was revelatory. It\u2019s rare to find respectability, white supremacy, Jew hate and Muslim hate right next to one another, without a new paragraph or anything. Well played, Nancy. Well played.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Nancy, I hate to point this out, but they would fire me at The Root if I didn\u2019t. If I didn\u2019t ask the following question, Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton would call me into her office and ask me what the hell was wrong with me. She would probably stage an intervention, so I am compelled to ask:\n\nWhere the fuck is Islam?\n\nYou said I should \u201c[g]o to Islam and see what they still do to blacks today\u201d? How? I went on Travelocity and couldn\u2019t find a direct flight to Islam. Could you tell me the nearest airport? Do they have hotels, or would I need an Airbnb? There are so many questions I have, but we don\u2019t have enough time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I were to clap back at this letter (which I won\u2019t because I\u2019m praying that you and I become pen pals), I would dispel that whole notion about the scourge of black men raping white women by telling you to read this article:\n\nBut I would never do that, because I know you don\u2019t read, Nancy. Plus, I\u2019m not clapping back at you, remember? If I were, I\u2019d ask you how you could tell black people that you are not responsible for the sins of your ancestors and then turn around and take credit for all of Western civilization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt defies logic, but then again, I know you didn\u2019t enslave me, Nancy. I am 100 percent clear that you had nothing to do with slavery, even though you somehow made slavery Barack Obama\u2019s fault. (Again, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the Obama part. Bravo, Nancy.)\n\nYou know what else I know, Nancy? I know you didn\u2019t invent shit, either. You couldn\u2019t build a boat, a house or a civilization. You can barely build a shitty email.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that you have personally never done anything to me, but I know you have done something to someone black, Nancy, simply by existing. Simply by believing that you \u201clet\u201d us be millionaires and president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore I go, since we are in the mood to take credit, allow me to take credit for something my people have given to mediocre white women whom Darwinian evolution should have stamped out long ago. Allow me to pat myself on the back for the one thing that my people have \u201clet\u201d vile, disgusting, barely literate bitches like you be:\n\nAlive.", "keywords": ["hate", "didnt", "clapback", "read", "roots", "know", "white", "email", "women", "im", "whitest", "dont", "mailbag", "black", "nancy"], "polarity": -0.050368051260908424, "subjectivity": 0.4903705421562561},

I think someone slipped a headache into my drink last night at The Root 100 gala. It\u2019s either a hangover or I have sudden-onset brain cancer. That\u2019s not a thing, is it?\n\nOr maybe it was Social Media Editor Corey Townsend screaming the lyrics to Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d at me. Can I call the police? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a hate crime. Or terrorism. Or white supremacy.\n\nAnyway, there are many people who doubt the veracity of some of the mailbag letters because they apparently don\u2019t think people could be so shitty in real life. There are some who think the hate letters, emails and tweets we receive are from people who are trolling because they want to be featured in the mailbag. Some people even think we fabricate the letters and this whole \u201cmailbag\u201d thing is a ruse.\n\nNah, nigga. This shit is real.\n\nIn fact, this week, instead of hate mail, let\u2019s just look at some actual comments from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is an actual comment \u201cMadril\u201d left on a story about a caf\u00e9 that refused to give candy to black kids on Halloween:\n\nSome of you will take this the wrong way because AA or Black Americans have been conditioned to be the victim in America. It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["say", "clapback", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "gray", "madril", "shit", "im", "black", "area", "think", "mailbag", "dont"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

After rolling our eyes at his whining, we started to think about the growing number of men who care about their hair health, and how it may be difficult to find a similar community and shared knowledge geared toward their needs.\n\nBig names in natural-hair products, like Shea Moisture, Form (from the minds behind Bevel) and Oyin, have all extended their product lines to cater to the needs of men. The natural-hair movement seems to be recognizing that there is room for the fellas, too, and the DIY culture of social media is following suit.

One of Ferrer\u2019s followers posted a picture of her young son, explaining that he was being teased for his long hair and had been asking to cut it until seeing Ferrer\u2019s page and videos.

With videos on twist-out and stretching techniques posted already, this gentleman is off to a great start in helping men with their questions about grooming and hair care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent video, Barnes leaves his followers with an ever important reminder about loving and living for yourself: \u201cIf we\u2019re always wondering and worried about what other people may think about us, we will never move forward in life and progress.\u201d We hope to see more of this positive personality as he becomes more comfortable sharing his journey.\n\nWhat I love the most about Humphrey\u2019s page is that he takes men\u2019s hair way past the wash-and-go styles we\u2019ve come to expect\u2014trying box braids, Bantu knots and beaded cornrows. With a hilarious personality and \u201cinstant bestie\u201d vibe, Will brings his followers hairstyle tutorials, product suggestions and routine rundowns. He\u2019s also included content around travel, beauty routines and what he calls \u201cshenanigans,\u201d dropping a little something for everyone on his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the midst of all the loose-textured, \u201ccurls with just water\u201d vloggers, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to see tutorials and product reviews targeting kinky coil textures. The best advice we got from Humphrey\u2019s page? \u201cDead ends are like fake friends ... cut them off.\u201d Life and hair goals unite!\n\nBefore we even got to McDonald\u2019s hair tutorials, we wanted to know every single tip this man has about brows. Thankfully, he heard our cry and gave a detailed walkthrough of his shape, cut and clean routine for his full brows as the very first video posted to his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, McDonald has brought followers along for the ride as he started college, got played by Tinder dates and shared his roommate horror stories. After two years of his life and hair updates (including video cameos with his siblings), we feel as if we\u2019re officially part of the McDonald family. To call this rising star a natural-hair guru seems a bit limiting, since his channel definitely tackles more than just hair tutorials. But we\u2019re glad to see another young voice setting his own standards for beauty and style for men.\n\nCamera-shy, Sheldon is not. Just a short scroll down his feed shows that this fella knows his way around a beauty shot and isn\u2019t new to the \u201cflip and smize\u201d game. This strand star recognizes the dedication (and arm strength) it takes to maintain healthy hair and take on the task of twist-outs and curl techniques.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also brings a great young perspective to the natural-hair community, using new-gen rappers like Lil Yachty and Travis Scott for hairstyle inspo. In a recent video on his page, while blowing out his hair for box braids, Sheldon joked, \u201cY\u2019all ask me about my workout routine\u2014this is it.\u201d\n\nWe feel you, Sheldon; wash day and arm day go hand-in-hand around here.", "keywords": ["followers", "healthy", "tutorials", "men", "product", "video", "things", "coed", "ready", "beauty", "naturalhair", "guyrus", "teach", "videos", "hair", "teamnatural"], "polarity": 0.21418345543345543, "subjectivity": 0.48765262515262503},

Instead of clapping back at the people who send emails, tweets and direct messages, we would like to thank our haters, because without them, where would we be?\n\nAs you sit back munching on your leftover dressing and sweet-potato-pie sandwich (don\u2019t judge me; I\u2019m just trying to eliminate waste by recycling), remember that whatever you do in life, if you don\u2019t have haters, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet us commence with the clapping:\n\nOur first correspondences this week refer to a story we recently published about Nazi furries. The community of furries (not to be confused with the furry community\u2014people with an excessive amount of back hair) was very upset about our post on the trend of alt-right anthropomorphic cosplayers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Buddy\n\nTo: The Root Tips First off spreading lies about something you have little to no information about, and using a photo completely out of context, On of the suiters is a partially deaf gay man, there is just as much Nazi propaganda in the furry community and there is in a loaf of bread. This is why only certain news outlets grow enough to recognised, they don\u2019t lie nor spread rumor to get attenchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Furries:\n\nFirst, allow me to thank you for reaching out to me. I am delighted to share this open dialogue with you and your community. I hope The Root can become a place where people of all costumes can come together and exist in unity, no matter their fur or made-up species.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I would like to say that, as an equal opportunity site, we would never limit people from doing what they believe. As such, I want to clarify our belief that the phenomenon of \u201cwhite-people shit\u201d is not limited to people of the Caucasian persuasion. Yes, a nonwhite gay man can, indeed, participate in white-people shit.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the term was not coined to besmirch the activities enjoyed by taupe Americans. It was meant to praise their imagination, unfettered by the fear of being marginalized or categorized. Our wish for humanity is that we all, one day, can enjoy the privilege of participating in white-people shit.\n\nI do, however, object to your belief that having sex with a black man means that you cannot be a racist. History is filled with examples to the contrary. Slaveholders routinely had sex with slaves while upholding the tenets of white supremacy. There are many incidents of white women who had consensual sex with black men and then pointed lynch mobs in the direction of their lovers. Racism and interracial sex are not mutually exclusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, on the other hand, uphold your right to have sex with whomever you choose. Whether it be a black man or a fuchsia fox wearing a Nazi-inspired armband, if you like it, I love it.\n\nJust remember to use protection. I don\u2019t want you to get rabies.\n\nFrom: Chantel\n\nTo: Michael Harriot I read your article on Black Thanksgiving. I love your writing, but would like you to know that not everything is about race.Stuff like Thanksgiving is universal. Your aritcles about black thanksgiving is so similar to white thanksgiving. We might not eat the same kind of food, and our relatives might be slightly diferent in the way we treat each other, but everything els is exactly alike. I am white, but I recognized almost everything in your article. If The only difference in me and you is what we call our aunts and how we like our macarone, then we might not be so different afger all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Chantel,\n\nYou might want to look up the definition of the words \u201cexactly alike.\u201d\n\nThanks.\n\nFrom: Bill S.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot Hello Michael, I\u2019d like to apologize for contracting you on your personal email address.\n\nTried to find a method of contact on the site, but an email address for writing submissions was all I could find in the way of contact. I also posted this in reply to your last Clapback posting, but I\u2019m a member of the Greys and with a last name like S., Ill likely never not be on The Root. Ok let\u2019s get to my application.\n\nI think I have finally figured out what irks me about your writing Michael. Well actually I shouldn\u2019t say writing, as you are a damn fine writer. I guess I should say, the content in your writing.\n\nI\u2019m not poor ol Dusty from the last set of clapbacks, and Im not gonna get offended by comments that you make. I\u2019m honestly too damn busy trying to pay my bills every month to get riled by an internet comment.\n\nWith that said, I think the issue I have with your writing is that you\u2019re coming across as just another provocateur, in what seems like an ever growing sea of provocateurs. A provocateur as I see it, only serves one purpose, and that\u2019s to stir the pot. Honestly I dont have any problem with stirring the pot, because that needs to happen from time to time, and it would seem it needs to happen often when it comes to social issues. The problem with provocateurs is that they never stop stirring for long enough for the change they provocate for to actually take place.\n\nNow obviously Im not saying that if you stop now, all of a sudden all of the racist bullshit out there is instantly going to vanish. That obviously does not hinge on your writing. What I am saying is that I wish the provocative nature of your writing could take a back seat more often now that the site has a pretty good base. I wish there was more writing on here about ideas to bring about change now that you have a voice with a platform and base that will hear you.\n\nYou can keep writing about the evils of Whitey till the sun burns out, and we both know it will continue to work from a blogging perspective. What it does not do however, is make a damn bit of difference. You and I are both now old enough to recognise that pointing out a wrong and getting people to recognize said wrong, does not mean that the wrong will be righted. I swear, if I hear one more god damn millennial say \u201cyou need to recognize...\u201d, I\u2019m going to lose my goddamn mind. As if their generation is the first to be cognisant of racial and social injustices, or that the simple recognition of those injustices will fix anything.\n\nWe now have roughly 3 generations of people that were brought up to recognise racial and social injustice. I think its safe to say that we have the numbers to bring on some level of change. Continuing to to simply ask for recognition at this point is about as useless as poor ol Dusty comment to you.\n\nI want to be clear that I am not trying to tell you what you should be doing with regard to your writing. I am trying to voice what I wish you and the rest of the writers at The Root would do more often. As I see it you can be content with being Flavor Flav, or you can be Public Enemy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill,\n\nThank you for finally enlightening me on this subject.\n\nI have received a million letters like yours, but you, in your eloquence, finally solved a puzzle that I have been unable to decipher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am often asked this question or presented with this argument in various forms. Some of the most popular are:\n\nWhy must you always talk about racism all the time?\n\n\n\nWhy not offer solutions?\n\n\n\nTalking about race and prejudice only leads to more divisiveness.\n\n\n\nBut you\u2019ve figured it out for me, Bill. Because of your letter, I finally understand:\n\nWhite people have amnesia.\n\nYou\u2019re partially right, Bill: I often point the finger at white people when it comes to racism. But the idea that I or any writer at The Root never speaks about solutions is either a blatant attempt to ignore the facts or a goddamn lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will not call you a liar, Billy.\n\nBut if you are not a liar, then you are either stupid or you have a strain of forgetfulness I like to call sudden-onset Caucasian amnesia. Let\u2019s examine the facts:\n\nWhen I, or other writers, talk about the blatant, systematic racism in the criminal-justice system, white people accuse us of \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and not offering solutions. Either they are making the argument up, or white people\u2019s Wi-Fi can\u2019t download the incessant number of articles I and others writers here have written about how to change the criminal-justice system by voting, electing local prosecutors, getting engaged in activism, reorganizing the bail system and organizing communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to Change the World We are so often overwhelmed with complex issues and bad news that it is easy to forget the impact\u2026 Read more Read\n\nWhen we talk about education disparities, apparently you skipped by the posts about HBCUs, reforming school districts or community-based education projects. We tried to make it simple for your white mind, Bill, by highlighting our list of black children excelling in education with our Young Futurists series. We put it on our banner. We shone a light on them. Perhaps you aren\u2019t an overly sensitive snowflake crying every time you see the word \u201cwhite people\u201d on a black site. Maybe you just missed it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we talk about police violence, we offer solutions. When we discuss mass incarceration, we talk about ideas. We have written articles specifically aimed at white people who want to combat white supremacy.\n\nIn fact, there is not one single subject we have tackled here at The Root for which we have not addressed our own community about solving the problem among ourselves, whether it is inner-city crime, gang violence or bringing our own seasoning to white gatherings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour letter reminds me of the people who are anti-Black Lives Matter. Anyone who has ever lived in a black neighborhood will tell you that for every #BlackLivesMatter march, there are 10 Stop the Violence rallies. But Fox News never shows up at those events. Media outlets don\u2019t give them publicity, but they will point the camera at any white face willing to ask, \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nEvery single day this place focuses on black excellence and highlights those who are engaged in eliminating white supremacy. We have criticized both black and white alike. If you don\u2019t see it, it\u2019s because you have chosen to remain willfully ignorant.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re a goddamn liar.", "keywords": ["say", "writing", "clapback", "roots", "white", "im", "root", "talk", "dont", "thanksgiving", "mailbag", "black", "sex"], "polarity": 0.0361974573780129, "subjectivity": 0.4478799235743681},

Yes, we\u2019re making it a day of the week. The name \u201cFriday\u201d wasn\u2019t imaginative enough. Plus, it has nothing to do with frying. If they only served fried chicken and french fries, then I\u2019d be cool with the name, but I think the last day before the weekend should be reserved for clapping back.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about how we here at The Root respond to the hateful tweets, emails or comments; I\u2019m talking about you, too. Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week? Send an anonymous note to Sheila in human resources telling her she needs to use better deodorant, if only for the one day you have team meetings. Scream \u201cFuck you\u201d to the mailman who left your packages from Amazon.com in the rain.\n\nLet this be a healing day because the end of the week should be a catharsis so that you can empty out your negative energy and absorb something positive. Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications. The following letter is representative of them all.\n\nFrom: ABQ\n\nTo: Anne Branigin Why dont you go in as hard on punk hillary the aristocratic bitch that used bubba to imprison millions of poor mostly black men. Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas. Then we spend the rest of the day reporting, writing about or covering an issue.\n\nNone of us here at The Root are sitting around waiting for a story about Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton to surface so that we can bash either candidate. While we care about politics and how they affect minorities, when it comes to Bernie vs. Hillary, or Chrisette Michelle or most other divisive issues, we try to adhere to a strict journalistic policy known as \u201cnot giving a fuck.\u201d\n\nAnne isn\u2019t sitting around the office rocking back and forth like she\u2019s in a double Dutch competition waiting for a story so she can bash Bernie. She wrote about a quote that Bernie actually said. If you have an issue with what he said or how it was received, you should write an angry email to Bernie Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should also be aware of one other thing about Bernie Sanders (whom\u2014in the spirit of full disclosure\u2014I confess I voted for in the primaries):\n\nHe motherfucking lost.\n\nI wanted him to win. A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is. Some black and brown people just weren\u2019t down with Bernie like that. Deal with it.\n\nOr not.\n\nWe don\u2019t give a fuck.\n\nFrom: Greg T.\n\nTo: Michael Harriot\n\nSubject: You\u2019re obsession with white people Why are you so racist against white people. I think you are a good writer, but you take every opportunity to down white people. Your anti-white jokes aren\u2019t even funny anymore. Some white people don\u2019t care about race. It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black. Sure there are some racists, but they are a small minority of white people. You need to stop focusing on them and find some non-racist white friends. Or maybe you can\u2019t because your the one whose the racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg,\n\nFirst of all ... what anti-white jokes? I was being serious. Every single time.\n\nI\u2019m glad you sent this. I have often been accused of being a racist. So often, in fact, that I decided to be proactive about it.

Whennah Andrews of the U.S. Army National Guard tries to hide her braces while showing off her smile. But four years since first advocating against grooming regulations that barred soldiers from wearing natural hairstyles, her smile hints at relief over one of the final steps in the fight for acceptance.\n\nA decade-old ban on dreadlocks is finally coming to an end.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter all my years of service, I felt like I had a target on my back. I walked a very tight line, but my convictions were more important to me than a paycheck.\u201d \u2014Staff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Army directive, issued in February, adjusted its grooming policies related to allow dreadlocks\u2014which had been banned since 2005.\n\nThe policy that banned all natural hairstyles, called AR 670-1, first leaked online in 2014. It outlawed twists, braids, cornrows and Afros\u2014styles commonly associated with black women. Andrews first sent them to me before the revisions went public, and after our story sparked months of outrage\u2014including an open letter from the Congressional Black Caucus (pdf) and a review ordered by the Pentagon\u2014the Army reversed course.\n\nIt marked a significant victory for many black female soldiers. But Andrews wasn\u2019t one of them. Despite the Army\u2019s reversal, the ban on dreadlocks remained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a setback,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was attention paid to other styles like cornrows and twists, but a lot of people ignored dreadlocks because the mindset was, \u2018Well, they\u2019ve been banned already anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nBefore, the Army\u2019s vague definition of dreadlocks\u2014including controversial terms like \u201cunkempt\u201d and \u201cmatted\u201d\u2014allowed women with neatly groomed locs to bypass the regulation.\n\n\n\n\u201cLocs being unclean and unkempt is a stereotype that impacts the men and women who wear them,\u201d says popular beauty vlogger Nikky Nwamokobia. In a YouTube video, Andrews and Nwamokobia dispel common myths associated with dreadlocks\u2019 cleanliness and ease of use in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was important for the Army to see that, for many women, locs are their only option to maintain hair without using harsh chemical relaxers, weaves or wigs,\u201d Nwamokobia says.\n\nHundreds of soldiers were faced with a dilemma: Cut their hair, be reprimanded or unenlist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan of Fort Stewart, Ga., was also one of those soldiers. The 16-year soldier never had any issue since first locking her hair in 2011. But the natural-hair ban meant added scrutiny. After refusing to cut her locs, she faced a dishonorable discharge that would have affected her eligibility for work and education benefits under the GI Bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter all my years of service, I felt like I had a target on my back,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked a very tight line, but my convictions were more important to me than a paycheck.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was prepared for the worst, but a chance decision to style her locs in a bun during her appeal allowed her to exploit a loophole in the policy. Her hair now looked like Senegalese twists, which are authorized under AR 670-1. An examination of her hair right there in the hearing room determined that Logan was in compliance with the guidelines.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt shows you just how fickle the regulation was,\u201d she says. \u201cTo them, it was just hair, but for me it represented who I am as a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut even as the military, one of the most conservative institutions in the country, develops more progressive stances on hair, a return to civilian life may invite the same stigmas that dreadlocked servicewomen face while enlisted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employees face an uphill battle claiming race-based employment discrimination over their dreadlocks. Even though Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protects against workforce discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin, hairstyles aren\u2019t included.\n\n\u201cIf the person is Rastafarian, they have much firmer ground for claiming discrimination because it\u2019s generally accepted that they are a part of the religion,\u201d says attorney Arthur R. Ehrlich of the Chicago-based Goldman & Ehrlich law firm, which specializes in employment law and discrimination. Proving race-based discrimination, he says, is trickier because \u201chairstyles are not considered as characteristics associated with race.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, a federal judge ruled that employees and applicants don\u2019t have a right to wear dreadlocks after a young woman sued Alabama-based Catastrophe Management Solutions for racial discrimination. The insurance company rescinded her job offer after she declined to cut her locs. The EEOC, which represented the applicant, argued \u201cdreadlocks are a manner of wearing the hair that is physiologically and culturally associated with people of African descent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, however, the court disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I can serve my country with my hair the way God intended it but be denied a job when I return shows just how much work there is left to do.\u201d \u2014Staff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan\n\n\u201cIn the military and civilian world, the ones making these decisions are those who will never have the hair texture or cultural background to understand,\u201d says retired Sgt. Major Donnell Johns. Johns fielded the concerns of many servicewomen, including Andrews, about how to navigate the dreadlocks ban.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that dreadlocks, like many other black hairstyles, are deeply ingrained in cultural and ethnic identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter fighting to keep her dreadlocks, Logan, who has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, says that she refuses to take up the battle again in the corporate world. \u201cI rather go back to war than go through that process again,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that I can serve my country with my hair the way God intended it but be denied a job when I return shows just how much work there is left to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor now, the battle over dreadlocks in the Army may be won, but the war is far from over. Andrews and Nwamokobia have paired up again to take on the only military branch where a dreadlocks ban remains: the Navy. After initial talks, they plan to tackle the Navy\u2019s ban the same way they did the Army: through education. The goal is to enlighten Navy personnel and the public about their ease of use and necessity for black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are currently working on a video for the Navy\u2019s ban on locs,\u201d says Nwamokobia. \u201cWith the military as the role model, we plan on continuing on to corporate America in hopes to continue the momentum of positive and inclusive change.\u201d\n\nDespite a more progressive military, Andrews\u2019 reserved smile fades amid her concern over the hundreds of dreadlocked soldiers who will eventually return to civilian life. But she\u2019s \u201cprepared to fight against stereotypes with the same vigor for women outside the military as those within.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven if, for her, it was too late.\n\n\n\nAndrews, like many other servicewomen, cut her locs prior to the Army\u2019s reversal. While she\u2019s already growing them back, dreadlocks won\u2019t be formally accepted until next year.", "keywords": ["ban", "military", "servicewomen", "dreadlocked", "battle", "women", "civilian", "fight", "dreadlocks", "andrews", "locs", "discrimination", "army", "acceptance", "black", "hair"], "polarity": 0.06786226930963773, "subjectivity": 0.37948849396217815},

I know this sounds like some Inception-level shit where we make references to a mailbag inside a mailbag about the mailbag, so I will include some new stuff, too.\n\nLast week was a rough week for mail. I feel like you guys weren\u2019t bringing your racist A-game (the \u201ca\u201d stands for asswipe). I had to look for stuff to clap back at. I know it was the day after The Root 100 gala, and I may have awakened in my bed the next morning wearing a tuxedo jacket, formal shoes and no pants. I cannot confirm this, and also ... why are you being so nosy?\n\nLuckily, you guys really stepped up to the hate plate this week. I have received no less than 12 correspondences that contain the word \u201cnigger\u201d in them. While it does show a lack of creativity on the part of racists (400 years and \u201cnigger\u201d is the best you can do?*), it does set a new personal record for me.\n\nBravo, motherfuckers. Bravo.\n\nLet\u2019s read some mail:\n\n\n\n*I prefer the pure simplicity of \u201cporch monkey.\u201d\n\nThe following is a comment on Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan\u2019s article about a hair game, which some (white) people found very offensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: Mike Your just another niggger jealous of white people and pissed because you were born black, I would be to, you blacks snivel about everything and blame everyone else for your woes, but it is you who are to blame for the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way people of all races see blacks and the way we see you is justified by the way blaks as a whole are, basically lie animals, all races really hate blacks, even blacks hate blacks and kill each other by the hunddreds every day, you wil alwasy be the scum of the earth and rightly so\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike,\n\nIt is part of human nature to believe that everyone likes the same things and feels the same way you do. If you like a dish, how could anyone else not like it? If a joke makes you laugh, how could anyone else not think it\u2019s funny? The entire staff of The Root still can\u2019t wrap their minds around the idea that, after having tasted bacon, I think it is just \u201ca\u2019ight.\u201d They can\u2019t even process the concept. They have actually come to the conclusion that every time I\u2019ve tried it, it must have been fake bacon. Like there\u2019s an international conspiracy to slip mediocre pork products to Michael Harriot. It\u2019s probably beef lobbyists. Big beef must be behind it* (which, I must add, would be my stripper name). I said all of that to make this point, Mike:\n\nJust because you hate black people doesn\u2019t mean everyone hates black people.\n\nI know the concept is as mind-numbingly implausible as someone\u2019s being apathetic about eating pig thigh meat. I truly understand that so much hate is buried in the rancid, charcoal black muscle you call a heart that you think everyone in the world must obviously have the same despicable disposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike, you\u2019re not going to believe me when I say this, but trust me it\u2019s true: Not all white people are racist.\n\nNope. Trust me, it\u2019s true. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you another secret. There are even people in the world (I will admit, they\u2019re probably some kind of lexical geniuses or something) who use periods and all that fancy-schmancy punctuation shit. They even know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m going to keep the grammar thing between you and me, because I intend to cite you as a source to every Caucasian crier who says, \u201cNot all white people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n*That\u2019s what she said.\n\nFrom Twitter user BuildTheWall:\n\nThis comments related to article complaining to whites that bring up black on black crime. You said over 91% of blacks are killed by other blacks & most whites are murdered by other whites & failed to mention that 84% of whites are killed by other whites , blacks commit approximately 50% homicides in the U.S. every year & commit most crime at a much higher ratio / percent of other races. They burn towns / cities & then cry about needing everyone to give them something for free , they take over 35% welfare annually are only 13% - 15% of this nations population & shift the blame saying most welfare goes to whites. They are taught that only white people can be racist in some schools / colleges & this only makes race relations worse. Pointing out facts doesn\u2019t feel good does it? I am no racist & to be honest the world sucks. There will be no end to the shitholes that many poor or unemployed blacks live at in all major cities & poor black areas in general until welfare is cut off for many of them because a large percentage of them don\u2019t need it & just refuse to work like any other race. When you cut off welfare for those that can work & are just sitting home they\u2019ll to get off their asses & find a job. You have no idea how much better life would be for many people if they lost their welfare. I have seen major improvements in attitudes after they started working no matter their skin color. They were scared as hell at first & when they got a job their attitude was much better then when they were relying on welfare because they were able to get an apartment , had money to spend & got out of the shithole they were living in. My girlfriend was one of those black people that relied on welfare because she didn\u2019t want to work. I told her that she was only allowed to eat dollar store soup until she got a job & kept my food which was mainly meat & poultry was in a chest freezer. She left my food alone & found a job in only 1 week . When she got a job she was given a key to the chest freezer & allowed to eat whatever she wanted as long as she mentioned it if I was gone so I could replace it. She was also stuck at home & not able to go out until she got a job. You want to know what she did over it? She was angry at me about it until she got a job & thanked me for making her stay at home because she realized that\u2019s a little like how she was living for years & she no longer feels imprisoned like she was on welfare. She said the job gave her more freedom then she could have imagined & finally has some money to spend because of me. I overheard this when she was talking to a friend because she talks a little loud & th\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is so much to unpack here, so I won\u2019t. Instead, I would like to submit that this isn\u2019t one of the most racist things I\u2019ve ever received, but it is all the racist things I\u2019ve received. If someone wanted to know what kind of hate mail black writers get, this would be my prototype.\n\nIt is excellent in its sheer lack of fucks given about grammar. The way he refers to his arbitrarily derived statistics as \u201cfacts\u201d is baconlike in both taste and saltiness. But you know what my favorite part is? The way, smack dab in the middle of this verbal diarrhea, he says, \u201cI\u2019m no racist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favorite parts.\n\nI was actually going to include this letter in last week\u2019s mailbag, but last Friday\u2019s bag of bullshit ran pretty long, so I had totally forgotten about the part where he said he had a black girlfriend whom he trained to work and be responsible through a system of starvation and ass-whippings. (I know the DM didn\u2019t say anything about ass whippings, but y\u2019all know. ... You think this guy doesn\u2019t slap women around?) I am also still trying to wrap my head around the fact that an actual woman, with a vagina and everything, let him stick his flaccid, chicken-neck-looking, underdeveloped, thumb-shaped penis inside her. I guess even a trash can catches a steak some days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me to my last point about the worst people on the planet. I know I talk about racism very often, but there is a class of people who are worse than racists: the motherfuckers who put locks on refrigerators.\n\nIf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been limited to these motherfuckers, he would have been hailed as a hero. I\u2019ve always heard about these people, but even this brief, momentary contact makes me want to take one of those Silkwood showers where I scrub my skin really hard with a medium-bristle wire brush and then sit on the floor of the shower with my arms wrapped around my legs thinking about the complexities of the human condition and why they don\u2019t make Pop-Tarts without the icing anymore as my tears slowly dissolve down the drain.\n\nSee what I go through for y\u2019all?\n\nThe following are two comments left on last week\u2019s mailbag from a user named Dusty. Dusty was apparently triggered by me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nI like to pop in from time to time to see how other folks view the world who aren\u2019t like me and I have not posted until now. You write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation, but in the end, had a white person said \u201call black people are evil\u201d regardless of the explanation, they would immediately be branded a racist. How do you justify pointing out all the anti-black racism when many comments and articles on this site are anti-white? How do you expect a white person to act when you put your thumb in their eye at every opportunity?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDusty later wrote:\n\nSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate? How about all black people are evil?\n\nDearest Dusty,\n\nSorry for putting my thumb in your eye. I\u2019m also sorry that your anus is still so sore from me saying, \u201cWhite people are evil\u201d that you missed the entire point of last week\u2019s mailbag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, by the way. If a white person had said, \u201cAll black people are evil,\u201d I would have assumed they were racist. I probably wouldn\u2019t have typed a letter or comment to the site where they said it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have done it for one particular reason:\n\nIf I were browsing that imaginary site that said, \u201cBlack people are evil,\u201d I bet it would have a million stories on it. I would imagine that it had stories about crime, racism, inequality, injustice, death, satire, politics, pop culture and even achievements. After I perused through all of the other worldviews that are different from mine, the thing I would have been offended by the least (or at least not enough to toggle me into \u201cletter-writing mode\u201d) was someone saying, \u201cBlack people are evil.\u201d Would you like to know why?\n\nBecause I am not evil.\n\nI know it\u2019s hard dealing with the racism against white people. I\u2019ve felt it, too. Last year, while filling out my taxes, I told my son to get his registration so I could see how much I paid to register his car. I walked to the garage with him, and when he fumbled around in the glove compartment searching for the right paper, I yelled at him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wasn\u2019t being mean, but in that moment, all I could think about was, \u201cWhat if the wrong cop was standing over this black kid fumbling around in his glove compartment?\u201d That stupid little moment of teenage carelessness could cost my son his life\u2014because he is black.\n\nIt is a tough thing to wrestle with, watching your children, knowing the more they grow, the more they become prey. It is scary to think about that every time they leave the house. And then I thought, I bet this is just how Dusty feels when he reads words on the internet.\n\nSee? Our battles with racism are the same, Dusty.\n\nBut there is something else in your comments that I\u2019d like to point out:\n\nI said, \u201cWhite people are evil.\u201d\n\nYou asked, \u201cSo you think saying all white people are evil is appropriate?\u201d\n\nYou also wrote, \u201cYou write that all white people are evil and then try to make a nuanced explanation ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you notice the difference in those sentences, Dusty?\n\nYou added an \u201call.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201call,\u201d Dusty. Thank you for clearing this up for me. Now I understand everything. For so long I\u2019ve been accusing the \u201cnot all white people\u201d crowd of being too sensitive and privileged, but now I understand.\n\nWhite people can\u2019t read!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve pointed it out to me, it\u2019s clear, Dusty! Thank you for that.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that \u201call\u201d white people are illiterate. Just some. The ones who compare comments on the internet to 400 years of rape, torture, injustice, murder and inequality. The ones so dumb they actually think they can convince people that they are open-minded and sophisticated enough to cruise the internet to hear opinions different from their own, but so sensitive they can\u2019t handle opinions different from their own. The ones so privileged they think they can actually tell people that their opinions aren\u2019t \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all white people, Dusty.\n\nJust you.\n\nHey, Mike said it, not me.", "keywords": ["saying", "evil", "job", "clapback", "roots", "know", "white", "blacks", "way", "welfare", "mailbags", "think", "mailbag", "black"], "polarity": -0.06077503969763386, "subjectivity": 0.48780286426729924},

Way to demonize white people when your own shit race is responsible for the most crime in the country despite being only somewhere between 12-15% of the population. Go educate yourself so you can have some context the next time you feel like you want to speak about something you are so clearly ignorant in.\u2019\n\nDear Mr. YouAreStupid:\n\nFirst, I and my \u201cshit race\u201d would like to thank you for going on Twitter, creating an account and naming it \u201cMichael YouAreStupid.\u201d I wish I had that much time on my hands, but bravo to you. You are obviously good at whatever you do ... and racism. You are very good at racism.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m glad you brought to my attention how much less advanced my \u201cshit race\u201d is than every other race. Your intense research of stupid internet memes instantly trumps the nondebatable historical facts that every advancement in ancient European society was stolen from Africa.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have an \u201calt-right\u201d meme about how the things you hold dear for having been created by \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and white men were remnants of knowledge we donated to the savage palefaces who traveled to Egypt to learn science, astronomy and architecture? Is there a Twitter pic that shows how Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were really just hacks regurgitating remnants of philosophy they learned in Africa?\n\nDoes your meme research include any captions that talk about how the now decrepit Greek and Roman buildings were constructed centuries after the pyramids? Is there one that explains how Europeans thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth and didn\u2019t know how to navigate with compasses or by the stars until someone from the \u201cdark continent\u201d told them: \u201cHold up, you silly white man. Let me show you something\u201d?\n\nOr maybe you might be able to find a photo that represents the idea that Africans are living in huts because thirsty, greedy white men arrived on the shores of Africa ready to rape, pillage and plunder everything on the continent because ... well ... that\u2019s just what white people do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, just to see what it would look like, maybe you could show a collage comparison of the Native Americans, Africans, Aborigines, Aztecs, Mayans, Taino and Inuit to illustrate what happens when white people show up.\n\nNah, that\u2019s just too many \u201cshit race\u201d boxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianboz, there are a lot of black people who immediately dismiss the idea of reverse racism. I do not. I believe that it exists because I once met a white guy who explained to me how he grew up poor in an all-black neighborhood and was constantly picked on. I stand against all racism, even the reverse kind. It is demeaning, and no one should have to endure it.\n\nI think affirmative action is definitely a form of reverse racism. I also think that reverse racism is actually worse than regular, American-made, throwback racism, because no one acknowledges it, and it is harder to deal with.\n\nB-Boz, I understand that being white is like being a piece of delicate crystal\u2014you are easily broken. Someone so fragile shouldn\u2019t have to experience the horror of bigotry. I mean, black people have the luxury of having had their skin and psyches weathered and hardened by centuries of dealing with prejudice. It hurts so much more when you must deal with it once or twice in a lifetime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome people would say that crying about reverse racism is like whining about how much it hurts when lightning strikes, but not me, Boz. I feel your pain. I understand how affirmative action probably gave the two minority Fortune 500 CEOs their jobs, but the other 498 \u201cworked their way to the top.\u201d I believe you are right to direct accusations of reverse racism toward college admissions boards who want diverse institutions. I can\u2019t imagine how bad you feel when you are excluded from a job because a company wants to hire more minorities.\n\nBut I have a question for you, Brian B: Do you feel the same pain in your panties-bunched anal region when you conveniently ignore the biased testing, unequal education system, and history of segregation and exclusion that created the need for those programs? Are your white tears as salty when you think about how the black unemployment rate has been double that of whites for more than 50 years? When you hear how r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with black names are tossed in the trash, or how black people are paid less than white people regardless of education or experience, do you have the same level of butt-hurtedness?\n\nOne more question, Brian: Would you like to hear how I know the concept of \u201creverse racism\u201d is a bullshit product of white fragility, white tears and idiotic, unaware cognitive dissonance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause\u2014unlike the original-recipe racism that black people deal with every day\u2014\u201creverse racism\u201d happens so infrequently to white people that when it does, they actually remember it.\n\nThe following tweets are in response to the new Nas-and-Jay-Z-like beef between me and Megan McArdle in this article:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSabrina, don\u2019t listen to Doug. He is wrong. I do actually respect you. Contrary to popular belief, I don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure Doug thinks I do. There are many people who assume that I dislike white people as a whole, and I want to assure you that I do not. This next analogy is going to sound fucked up at first, but I pray you\u2019ll understand.\n\nI treat white people like my sister treats dogs.\n\nWhen my sisters and I were growing up, there were homes with mean dogs scattered throughout my neighborhood. One day, one of them got loose and bit my sister on the leg. She has been afraid of dogs ever since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy sister is smart. She knows that not every dog bites. She understands that most dogs won\u2019t bite her. But there is no way to distinguish the ones who will bite from the ones who won\u2019t, so she just stays away from dogs. She doesn\u2019t trust them.\n\nHere\u2019s the funny thing: My sister has a rescue dog named Lola that she absolutely loves. Actually, she loves Lola more than people should love animals. She takes her dog to dog church and treats it like a human. She knows Lola won\u2019t bite her because she knows Lola.\n\nSabrina, when I write about \u201cwhite people,\u201d I\u2019m writing about the mean ones. I\u2019m writing about the racist ones. I\u2019m not talking about all white people when I talk about race. I know that there are some white people who don\u2019t hold malice and racism in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut imagine how you would feel if you were attacked by dogs every day for 400 years. If you have been bitten by them at civil rights marches. If you have seen them chase you off their lawns. Imagine centuries of watching them maul people who look like you. Imagine knowing that they are trained by society to attack you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you leery of dogs?\n\nBut Doug would have you believe that I hate them. I do not. I don\u2019t even think that all, or even most, will bite. I just try to deconstruct the reasons dogs are like this. I want the training to stop so that I don\u2019t get nervous every time a dog sees me. I don\u2019t hate dogs.\n\nBut I know they all have teeth.", "keywords": ["feel", "clapback", "racism", "roots", "unanswered", "white", "know", "black", "dogs", "im", "questions", "reverse", "mailbag", "dont", "race"], "polarity": 0.019458046194687433, "subjectivity": 0.41400055203490305},

It is understandable that the psychological damage due to slavery, Jim Crow and Segregation still pervades the mind of many African Americans. Moreover, the Black Elites who are taking their cues from the White Liberal Elite and Democratic Leadership are also continuing to push the premise of Black Victimization and White Supremacy. The reality is that the cafe has the right not to give Black kids candy. It is their cafe. The same way you have the right to open a cage next door that will compete against this \u201cracist cafe.\u201d Or the right not to shop at that cafe. The only way to gain your respect is to build your own and stop complaining about racism. The fact is there are no government institutions in the USA in 2017 that will block African American or Black Americans from starting a competing cafe or any other business for that matter. Yes there are individual people who are racists, but that will never change.What needs to change is the victim attitude and playing the race card. The race card is lame and no one is listening or cares cause our community is not respected. America is the greatest country for economic opportunity and mobility. Plan and work harder and smarter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadril,\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you this in a tactful way, so I will just go ahead and say it because you aren\u2019t aware of the truth behind this statement:\n\nWhite people are evil.\n\nAfter reading your bullshit reasoned explanation, I was hesitant about making such a broad generalization. I even deleted and rewrote the sentence a few times. Then I realized that someone had to tell Madril. Maybe it should be me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore you get upset about me painting white people with such a broad brush, I want you to know that I don\u2019t think all white people are evil. According to my rough calculations, the percentage of evil white people is about the same as the ratio of poisonous snakes or venomous spiders to their respective populations overall. Now, I could take a course in herpetology and learn how to differentiate the killer snakes from the harmless ones, but just to be safe, I don\u2019t fuck with snakes.\n\nI know you don\u2019t want to think your people are evil, Madril. Neither do I. At first I tried to convince myself that maybe it was just Madril. Maybe Satan ejaculated into a shitbag of a human being who just happened to be ovulating, and 13 months later, out popped Madril (I think there is a longer gestation period for tiny pieces of toilet asswipe clotted with dried remnants of day-old diarrhea manifested in human form. I\u2019m pretty sure I read that in a medical journal), but then I thought, \u201cNah ... it\u2019s white people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault, Madril. You were enabled by your evil peers. I doubt that you are even aware of your evilness. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure of it. I\u2019m not shocked that you actually sat down and wrote a letter that used free-market economics to rationalize literally taking candy from babies\u2014any evil individual could do that. But you sent it to someone, Madril! The fact that you released it into the wild for all the world to see is proof that your people have normalized it until you are unaware of how vile you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you are a trash human being, don\u2019t despair. There is always room in this world for demons like you. I mean, it was your people who came up with the idea to combine two of the most despicable activities and ruin the world by simultaneously raping and pillaging. You used white-people-ing economics to justify colonization, genocide and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, so why not use it to explain how you fucked over babies who just wanted to trick-or-treat?\n\nSo go out there and keep shitting on toddlers, Madril. Keep on tricking. Keep on injecting poison into the world.\n\nMake your people proud.\n\nThis comment from \u201cSweetJamesJones\u201d is from The Root staffer Danielle Young\u2019s (I don\u2019t know her title, but I think it\u2019s either \u201cdope person\u201d or \u201cexecutive in charge of making fun of that one time Michael Harriot had on too much lip balm\u201d) brave article this week about her experience with famous men:\n\nAs a guy, I just want to say that this is tough. I want to be clear that the guys who did this stuff was wrong, but men are left in a Catch-22. I\u2019m sure I will be eviscerated, but here goes the reasoning. First, a lot of women love that type of attention. They feel it is complimentary, and it makes them feel wanted. Maybe all women are uncomfortable and not saying anything, but that\u2019s highly unlikely. Secondly, men have to pursue women, but there are no guidelines to doing so. All women have a different tolerance for flirting and contact. If a guy never makes an advance, he never gets a woman. If he comes in weak and respectful, some women will hate that. If he comes on strong, some women will see it as harrassment. As a guy, I\u2019m perplexed as to what to do as some women would feel uncomfortable if you simply ask them on a date. Instead of simply calling out these guys, can people actually come up with clear direction on how guys should act. Finally, Weinstein and others were clearly wrong. I am not defending that, but this seems like they simply found you attractive and wanted a chance. Its in a grey area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSweetJamesJones,\n\nYou know how I just eviscerated Madril a few seconds ago? Well, after careful consideration, in light of the revelations about Jesse Jackson, John Singleton, Harvey Weinstein, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and, now, Louis C.K., I think I need to say this:\n\nMen are trash.\n\nI know women say that shit all the time as if it were a joke, but they have no idea the percentage of men who are shit bags who should be tossed on the trash heap of humanity. We ain\u2019t shit. None of us. Myself included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, I ain\u2019t shit, either, SweetJamesJones. If I wasn\u2019t a piece of human garbage, my knuckles would be bleeding from punching motherfuckers like you in their fuckboy mouths. When I read about people like Bill Cosby, R. Kelly or Harvey Weinstein, I\u2019m not even shocked, because every man knows multiple other nonfamous men who do the same thing (minus the asking women if they can masturbate in front of them. That\u2019s strictly a white-boy thing). But we don\u2019t say shit because we aren\u2019t shit.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying men don\u2019t know where to draw the line for sexual harassment because some women like it? What kind of idiotic statement is that? There is a small minority of people who like everything, SweetShitJones. I know a woman who likes ketchup on her eggs, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t an atrocity. I once saw heard about a documentary on this streaming site called Pornhub about a man who became sexually excited from women defecating on him. He liked it. So would it be OK if a woman shit in your mouth without asking you, SweetJamesJones?\n\nJames, you say there are no guidelines to pursuing women. But there are. I\u2019ll tell you where the line is:\n\nStop. Being. White. People.\n\nSexism is just like racism, James. Only white people and toxic motherfuckers like you think in those selfish terms of not giving a damn about how anyone feels as long as you can ejaculate at the end of the encounter. You can\u2019t rape and enslave whole human beings because you want to have an orgasm or own a plantation, James. That\u2019s evil, man. There is just no other way to say it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what the fucked-up thing is, James?\n\nI believe you don\u2019t know where the line is. I believe you were being sincere. I believe Madril was being sincere. Madril doesn\u2019t feel like he hates black people, and you don\u2019t believe you hate women. At least Madril is just taking literal candy.\n\nBut just as Madril believes racism is a byproduct of normal society, you believe sexual harassment is a byproduct of your inherent male right to stick your dick into a moist hole\u2014all other humans be damned. The line is you, James. You are already across it because you think there is actually a line where you can almost sexually harass someone, but not quite!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoddamn, man, what the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with us?\n\nWe ain\u2019t shit.\n\nDamn, damn, damn, James.\n\nI\u2019m out.", "keywords": ["say", "clapback", "roots", "know", "women", "white", "gray", "madril", "shit", "im", "black", "area", "think", "mailbag", "dont"], "polarity": -0.02480267748124891, "subjectivity": 0.490844671201814},

But President Trump, whose proven himself to be the pettiest of bitches, commanded his personal top cop Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions to fire McCabe.\n\n\n\nSessions waited until just before 10 p.m. to announce that McCabe, who would\u2019ve been eligible for his full pension in just one day, was going to be terminated, because the Trump administration is nothing if not dramatic.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, McCabe stepped down from his second in command post at the FBI earlier this year, but was still employed and was still fighting to keep his job as recently as Thursday. The Post notes that McCabe spent some four hours inside the Justice Department pleading his case.\n\nBut, like Simba\u2019s uncle Scar before him, Trump has proven himself to be an evil bitch. He just couldn\u2019t let McCabe bow out with his money. Nope, he just had to knee-cap him on his way out the door.\n\nThe Post notes that McCabe\u2019s firing comes after a general investigation found that he \u201cauthorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case, then misled investigators about his actions in the matter, people familiar with the matter have said.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering McCabe\u2019s number of years at the agency and estimations of his high-level pay grade, formulas published by the US Office of Personnel Management for law enforcement officers show that his yearly payout could hit in the area of $60,000 each year, if McCabe were to retire after his birthday on Sunday,\u201d CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that McCabe can seek legal action to try and get his pension wages, but good luck with that. McCabe spent 20 years with the FBI and his tenure ends just days before he could have bowed out quietly.\n\nIn my best Joanne the Scammer voice I say, \u201cTrump is a messy bitch who lives for drama\u201d so much so that he couldn\u2019t wait to hop on Twitter at midnight to gloat over McCabe\u2019s firing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is the president that 53% of white women voted against their own self-interst to put in office and so far he\u2019s doing a stellar job, assuming of course that his job is to guide America into the fiery pits of hell.", "keywords": ["spent", "director", "job", "fbi", "proven", "fires", "president", "retire", "office", "petty", "screwing", "mccabes", "trump", "mad", "mccabe", "post", "pension"], "polarity": 0.12170781893004115, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["apart", "policy", "explain", "seeking", "refuge", "mother", "separate", "detention", "daughter", "border", "immigration", "parents", "congolese", "report", "torn", "post", "lawsuit", "case"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

In July 2016, a news story went viral about a school in Pretoria, South Africa, banning black girls from wearing natural hairstyles like Afros because they were \u201cuntidy\u201d and \u201cunladylike.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, twins Grace and Thabisa, who are of South Sudanese descent, were pulled out of their classes at Bentleigh Seconday School in Melbourne, Australia, and told to remove their braids because it didn\u2019t \u201crepresent the school.\u201d After an uproar from parents who said the policy was an attack on African culture, the girls were allowed to return to school.\n\nLast week, there was a story about twins Maya and Deanna Cook, students at Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden, Mass., who were kicked off their sports teams and prohibited from attending a prom because they wore their hair in braids.\n\nThe school said that the girls were in violation of the dress code for wearing their hair in an \u201cunnatural\u201d way, which includes braids. The girls were also placed in detention for two weeks for refusing to change their hair, and other black students were singled out for hair inspections.\n\nNews outlets reported this week that at Montverde Academy in Lake County, Fla., school administrators asked Nicole Orr, a 16-year-old black student, to change her natural hair because it was against the dress code. In both cases, school administrators contacted the parents first to ask them to \u201ccorrect\u201d the teens\u2019 hair. In Nicole\u2019s case, administrators cited the need for \u201cneat\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat black people in general and black girls specifically are being targeted by these discriminatory practices because of \u201cneatness\u201d and \u201ccleanliness\u201d is laughable. It is common knowledge that hair lice is a major problem with white schoolchildren, particularly in elementary schools. Thousands of letters go out to parents each year regarding lice outbreaks, and some parents complain that children with lice are sometimes allowed to stay in school, as was the case in Arlington, Va., in 2014.\n\nMany environmentalists, some of whom are students, believe that taking fewer showers saves water, which is true. This practice, however, also means that people are often subjected to foul bodily odors as well as dirty hair, which can be oily, greasy and downright smelly.\n\nAs a college professor, I encounter all kinds of folks. It has never occurred to me to file lawsuits against my students or colleagues, or to lobby for policies to put an end to this practice. If they\u2019re cool with having hair that sometimes smells like a combination of garlic bologna, dogs caught in rainstorms and formaldehyde, then so be it. In my head, I call it \u201ceau de funk for our future,\u201d and simply suck it up. So why are black people in general and black girls specifically being targeted?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Petty Pendergrass in me thinks that some folks are jealous because they don\u2019t have the versatility that natural hair affords black women. We can loc, twist, cut, grow, curl, weave, braid, shave\u2014pretty much do anything we want with it and look good doing it. If natural hairstyles worn by black girls are so bad, then why are white celebrities like Fergie, David Beckham, Juliette Lewis and the Kardashians celebrated for wearing them?\n\nThe academic in me knows that there\u2019s something more occurring: the targeting of black girls for whatever infraction\u2014perceived or real\u2014of normative worldwide behavior. Historically, the bodies of young black girls have been policed, touched, harassed and violated\u2014legally. See slavery. See segregation. See the civil rights era. See the post-civil-rights era. See the new millennium. See Halle Berry\u2019s unwanted kiss from Adrien Brody at the 2003 Academy Awards. See the kidnapped girls of Chibok, Nigeria. If you think that a focus on people touching black women inappropriately, especially when it comes to our hair, is a stretch, then listen to Solange\u2019s song \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d for a recent testimony.\n\nWhat is happening to our girls now is not a stretch. In fact, it is part of the fabric of our country and its institutions. In September 2016, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in a lawsuit filed against Catastrophe Management Solutions, effectively ruling that refusing to hire someone because he or she wears dreadlocks is legal. Out of all the hairstyles people wear in this country, dreadlocks\u2014a natural hairstyle that is sometimes worn for religious purposes, sometimes for fashion or for personal expression\u2014were singled out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscriminating against people with \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d hair cuts across many categories, including race, class, gender and nationality. Singling out and discriminating against black women for natural hairstyles like locs and twists is quite common, in fact. In 2014, Ayana Byrd and Lori L. Tharp wrote an article for the New York Times entitled, \u201cWhen Black Hair Is Against the Rules,\u201d detailing the long history of discrimination by U.S. institutions against black hairstyles. The article came out just as the U.S. Army\u2019s grooming policies, some of which specifically targeted black women\u2019s natural hairstyles, including dreadlocks, were being revised by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel after the Congressional Black Caucus, led by Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), requested the revision.\n\nReportedly, there was a lot of confusion about the rules because many officers had trouble differentiating among locs, twists and cornrows. Despite the federal circuit court\u2019s ruling in 2016 allowing discrimination in hiring against blacks with dreadlocks, the U.S. Army lifted the ban on locs, ending years of \u201cscrutiny and confusing enforcement of rules about their appearance,\u201d in February 2017.\n\nEven though the Army could have continued to legally enforce the policy as a requirement for employment, it chose to do the opposite. Why? Because singling out one group of people for something like hair is demoralizing, abusive and unnecessary. How do you ask people to die for their country but then give them grief over the actual hair growing out of their scalps? The answer is, you don\u2019t, because, wait for it: It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is happening to these young black girls in schools is what happens when a federal circuit court makes it OK to discriminate against black people with natural hair in the workplace. Those in positions of authority at these schools think it is their right to swap one environment for another and pick on black girls because of their \u201cunnatural\u201d natural hair.\n\nThe only thing \u201cunnatural\u201d about the situation is that so-called educators would try to enlist Nicole Orr\u2019s parents in an attempt to socially isolate her; assault her psyche, self-identity and self-esteem; and demand that she change her beautiful head of hair. What\u2019s natural about that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a parent is hard in general, but being the parent of a black child is exhausting. Why? Because we always have to worry about someone messing with our children for no reason other than that they\u2019re black. We are always managing the expectations of others, including how our children should look in order to be palatable to them. Unfortunately, black parents also have to worry about our children being harassed, bullied or publicly humiliated by adults\u2014grown people with academic degrees and all sorts of training, who should know better and do better.\n\nAs an educator and the mother of a black girl whose hair is natural and will remain so until she is old enough to decide otherwise, I would ask these adults to please take their hands and policies out of our daughters\u2019 hair. In the words of India.Arie, black girls are not their skin, hair or your expectations. They are girls\u2014human beings\u2014who deserve to be educated without being degraded, publicly ridiculed or humiliated. Let go of archaic ideas about black people, let go of ridiculous policies about black hair and let go of the need to constantly police black bodies, especially black girls. For God\u2019s sake, let our girls be girls, and let our girls learn.\n\n", "keywords": ["hairstyles", "natural", "girls", "parents", "wearing", "school", "learn", "let", "students", "black", "hair"], "polarity": 0.005687039568618517, "subjectivity": 0.4251841725525933},

Why not use this day to clap back at everyone who fucked with you during the week?

Because next week is going to be shitty, too. Because haters gonna hate and motherfuckers gonna motherfuck.\n\nBecause clapping back is self-care.\n\nThe following is a Twitter direct message received by staff writer Monique Judge from a reader named Patrick:\n\nSince you \u201csaid what you said\u201d I\u2019ll say what I say too: It\u2019s great and makes sense that Lion King has a predominately black cast. However you making it about race and calling people \u201cpasty faces\u201d how does that make things better? How is it not divisive? Racism is not a one way street-and your angry and hatefully-toned blog posts and replies to comments just go to show that. Racism is not an American problem, it\u2019s a human problem and honestly, minorities in America have it pretty damn good. I\u2019m not saying things are perfect, but please go to any country in the world and by comparison you will see how much more tolerant and accepting people are in the US-byfar. Just like you have nothing to be ashamed of for being black, I don\u2019t have any self-loathing tendencies for being white. It\u2019s just a shame that black people can be openly racist and think it\u2019s only an one-way street, because it\u2019s obvously not. And before you reply some angry and race-based argument about how bad being black is in America and how oppressed you are, please save it. If yo want to talk like an adult and not shout insults at people for being different than you, I\u2019m open to that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDearest Patrick,\n\nFirst of all, Monique is racist.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way. I have spoken to our HR department about her calling white people pasty faces. That\u2019s just wrong. If Monique is using Elmer\u2019s glue as a standard, I think her adjectives are offensive, too. I believe your faces have more of a biscuit-dough complexion. The good biscuits, though. Like Pillsbury or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I\u2019d like to thank you and all white people who have the hubris to use the \u201cIt could be worse\u201d argument. It\u2019s like telling a woman who\u2019s been beaten up and left for dead, \u201cWell, at least he didn\u2019t rape you.\u201d\n\nBut I really wanted to get to your main point, Patty. One of the things I\u2019m most confused by is the vast quantity of white people who come to a site about race, read the content and reply, \u201cWhy do you have to make everything about race?\u201d\n\nThat is literally what Monique is paid to do, Pat. Your complaint is akin to someone asking why ESPN doesn\u2019t focus on politics more often. Why does everything have to be about sports over there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not a technical wizard by any stretch of the imagination, but let me let you in on a bit of advanced computer coding that is hidden in whatever platform you are using to read this: If you look at the top of your screen, there is a small symbol of an arrow pointing left. That is called the \u201cback button.\u201d If you click on it, miraculously you won\u2019t be forced to read Monique\u2019s words. Also, If Monique\u2019s words make you uncomfortable, then good. It\u2019s the job of everyone here to make white people uncomfortable. All white people. Uncomfortable enough to do something. Anything.\n\nSome will not feel uncomfortable at all. They will think to themselves, \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I don\u2019t participate in racism, so I\u2019m not offended by any of this because they\u2019re not talking about me.\u201d\n\nSome of them, in their discomfort, will say, \u201cFuck The Root.\u201d\n\nSome of them will say, \u201cFuck this system; I need to do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnd some, unfortunately, will feel so uncomfortable about their own subconscious racism that in hopes of absolution, they will take the time to direct-message a writer about how black people complain too much about racism as they, themselves, are whining about a motherfucking Disney movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news fellow Anne Branigin wrote this story:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the article appeared, Anne received a boatload of communications.

Or her advocacy of private prisons. And to later imply who blacks should vote for. How about shutting the fuck up bitch. What could your snow white ass come in and tell us collectively whats for our good. Im a bernie or bust voter that voted for trump cause i hated hillary and wanted an end to globalization. 8 years obama had an opportunity to adress criminal justice reform. 8 YEARS!!!!! bottom line before you go out and denounce the only person with guts to advocate for the belitttled and downtrodden do a little inbiased research your self. As a real black person, not some bitch with a platform to talk, i think that hes a ok with me. How about asking a black person before writimg about what we need pr who we feel is that person to advocate for it. It sure wasnt cunt ass hillary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear ABQ,\n\nFirst of all ... I asked Monique, and she told me that Anne isn\u2019t pasty white or \u201csnow white.\u201d Anne confirmed that while she has seen seven dwarfs, she has never lived with seven of them. Or a prince.\n\nBut I thank you for your letter. I want to explain how this anti-Bernie bias works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery morning, the writers at The Root compile a list of stories we will write about. Some of them are assigned to us. Some of them are newsworthy events. Some of them are our own ideas.

A lot of black and brown people wanted him to win. But he got his ass whipped. Very few people think that Hillary Clinton is a friend to black people or even unworthy of being called a \u201ccunt ass.\u201d (Although I do question your blackness for using that word. It\u2019s just not a thing for us.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we write a story that reflects how actual people feel, it\u2019s not meant to be an attack. It just is.

It is people like you who are so obsessed with everything white people do or say who keep racism alive. Just like some white people need to get to know black people, you need to get to know some non-racist whites. Most white people are good people who want the same thing in life like everybody black.

But President Trump, whose proven himself to be the pettiest of bitches, commanded his personal top cop Jeff \u201cKing Keebler\u201d Sessions to fire McCabe.\n\n\n\nSessions waited until just before 10 p.m. to announce that McCabe, who would\u2019ve been eligible for his full pension in just one day, was going to be terminated, because the Trump administration is nothing if not dramatic.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, McCabe stepped down from his second in command post at the FBI earlier this year, but was still employed and was still fighting to keep his job as recently as Thursday. The Post notes that McCabe spent some four hours inside the Justice Department pleading his case.\n\nBut, like Simba\u2019s uncle Scar before him, Trump has proven himself to be an evil bitch. He just couldn\u2019t let McCabe bow out with his money. Nope, he just had to knee-cap him on his way out the door.\n\nThe Post notes that McCabe\u2019s firing comes after a general investigation found that he \u201cauthorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media about a Clinton-related case, then misled investigators about his actions in the matter, people familiar with the matter have said.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering McCabe\u2019s number of years at the agency and estimations of his high-level pay grade, formulas published by the US Office of Personnel Management for law enforcement officers show that his yearly payout could hit in the area of $60,000 each year, if McCabe were to retire after his birthday on Sunday,\u201d CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Post reports that McCabe can seek legal action to try and get his pension wages, but good luck with that. McCabe spent 20 years with the FBI and his tenure ends just days before he could have bowed out quietly.\n\nIn my best Joanne the Scammer voice I say, \u201cTrump is a messy bitch who lives for drama\u201d so much so that he couldn\u2019t wait to hop on Twitter at midnight to gloat over McCabe\u2019s firing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is the president that 53% of white women voted against their own self-interst to put in office and so far he\u2019s doing a stellar job, assuming of course that his job is to guide America into the fiery pits of hell.", "keywords": ["spent", "director", "job", "fbi", "proven", "fires", "president", "retire", "office", "petty", "screwing", "mccabes", "trump", "mad", "mccabe", "post", "pension"], "polarity": 0.12170781893004115, "subjectivity": 0.42366255144032927},

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks.

And I don\u2019t mean in a political kind of way. I mean the sense of culture and community that surrounds how we groom our luscious locks, regardless of how we choose to treat or style them. That is whether they\u2019re permed, natural, weaved, in dreadlocks or up in box braids.\n\nAt any given point you can find a black woman commenting on another black woman\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cI love that style, where did you get your hair done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you buy that hair, girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat products do you use?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you get your locs so curly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many packs of hair did it take to get your braids like that?\u201d\n\nThe conversations can be endless. There are countless YouTube channels, blogs, social media pages, etc., dedicated to helping black women find #HairInspo, showing them wash routines and styling techniques and reviewing hair products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now there\u2019s an app for that. Three black software engineers and entrepreneurs\u2014Cassandra Sarfo, Esther Olatunde and Priscilla Hazel\u2014have created Tress, an app they hope will become the one-stop shop for all your black hair needs, inspirations and appointments.\n\n\u201cWe do this all the time: We see a hairstyle that we like. We stop people on the street just to ask them where they did their hair, how much it cost them, or ask them for their stylist\u2019s number,\u201d Hazel told The Root. \u201cAnd my mom, she takes pictures of her TV screen and [messages] me and asks me where she can have it done. It\u2019s a habit that we have that we do all the time.\u201d\n\nSo the women put their heads together to come up with a solution for what they saw as an obvious demand, and the app Tress was born. The long-term goal is to make Tress a one-stop shop for all things hair, and for the platform to be a seamless integration between someone seeing a hairstyle and knowing all the products and procedures (and even people!) used to create it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it stands now, the search starts on the street or on social media with someone loving a hairstyle. Then maybe they have to search for tutorials on how to style the hair, or where to purchase specific products or extensions. Then it\u2019s a matter of, can this be done with your own two hands, or should you put your life in a stylist\u2019s hands?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re constantly moving from one platform to the other, trying to figure out how to get information on one style you want to get done. So, for us, we thought it\u2019d be cool if we could just build a platform where you can actually come and find hairstyle inspiration, interact with people who post their hairstyle, be able to purchase products for those particular hairstyles and then eventually be able to book stylists all on one platform,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently on the app, women can find hair inspo and filter hairstyles by the type they\u2019re looking for, or even by cost. Women can also upload and share photos of their own hairstyle, adding whatever information is necessary, and contribute to community discussions about best hair-care practices and other tips. You can see what\u2019s trending, and even bookmark hairstyles for later viewing.\n\n\n\nThe women behind the app hope that within the next six to eight months, users will be able to purchase products through the app directly. A little further into the future, the next priority will be enabling women to book hairstylists.\n\n\u201cWe want to be very city-focused. We probably will start in certain cities when it comes to booking, and even maybe purchasing products. But we want people to be in a certain city and see where they can find a stylist to have their hair done through the platform,\u201d Hazel explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three women behind the app are currently based in California. However, Sarfo and Hazel are originally from Ghana, while Olatunde hails from Nigeria.\n\nHazel used to do marketing of consumer products before getting interested in tech. After the field sparked her interest, she quit her job and went to school to learn as much as she could about tech. It was there she met her co-founders, who were already in the space: Sarfo has a degree in information technology, and Olatunde has a degree in computer engineering.\n\nThis is the talent that came together and founded Tress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work on something that affects us, especially as black women,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHair is a big deal for us. We have one of the most unique hair types of any demographic. ... It\u2019s part of our identities, a part of our culture. It\u2019s not a matter of whether you have a lot of hair [or not],\u201d she added. \u201cHair is important for us. Hair, for black women ... is important to their fashion; it has to do with confidence. It\u2019s part of you.\u201d\n\nRight now, the free app is available on iOS and Android and has around 100,000 downloads.\n\nIn the future, the trio is hoping for much bigger things, wanting \u201cblack women\u2019s hair\u201d and Tress to become synonymous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you think about hair, you should think about Tress, and when you think about Tress, you think about hair for black women,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cIt should be synonymous with hair.\u201d", "keywords": ["hazel", "tress", "techies", "hairstyle", "hoping", "hairinspo", "women", "app", "products", "female", "needs", "platform", "think", "cater", "black", "hair"], "polarity": 0.11631493506493507, "subjectivity": 0.48742784992785},

That\u2019s the lowest monthly average for any yearlong period since at least 2000; under President Obama, the same sections together averaged more than a half-dozen cases a month. Cases begin when the Justice Department starts investigating whether a person or organization violated the law. Following the investigation, DOJ attorneys send a letter or complaint detailing the allegations against them and their findings. For example, after Freddie Gray\u2019s death in Baltimore police custody in 2015, the division initiated an investigation into the department, which resulted in a findings letter the next year. Another way to measure the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights enforcement activity is to look at legal agreements reached with people, companies, and organizations accused of discrimination. These agreements are one of the most common ways a case ends, and they typically come with fines or concessions. In Baltimore, the Justice Department imposed a court-monitored consent decree that listed goals for the police to meet before it could be lifted. Under Trump, the division has reached about six of these kinds of agreements per month, on average, the fewest since at least 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017 the Justice Department announced that it would be reviewing 2017\u2019s white supremacist violence and protests in Charlottesville, Va., but provided little information about where the investigation is now. Good money is on the Department of Justice finding that there are good people on both sides and that the tiki-torch-wielding white supremacists are really misunderstood, good kids just finding their way.\n\nVice News notes that a spokesman for the DOJ refused to provide the number of active investigations being pursued by the department.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to say,\u201d Lhamon told Vice News. \u201cWhat are they hiding?\u201d\n\nWell, for one, Sessions has yet to explain how, after all of these years, he and several of his workers have been able to make delicious cookies in a fucking tree, so there is that. It should shock no one that this administration is less concerned with the treatment of minorities, immigration rights or employment litigation\u2014all areas handled by the DOJ.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone.

It was a year after she became the breakout star of the breakout hit Braxton Family Values, and a year before the release of her album Love and War.\n\nShe had a peppy smile plastered across her face throughout the segment. And why wouldn\u2019t she? Finally, she was becoming a force of her own creation, someone whose fame origins could be directly attributed to her work, rather than one whose seedbeds stemmed from the contributions of another\u2014in her case, her ultrafamous sister, the legendary Toni Braxton. More important, she was inching closer and closer to her real aim: to successfully relaunch the solo career she\u2019d always wanted.\n\n\n\nIt has proved to be very difficult to launch a black female singer in the last decade. Black radio\u2019s influence has waned. Record labels have shifted interests and have largely sought to repeat formulas they know can score quick cash, at a time when the sudden shift in how we collectively consume music has depleted profit margins. They\u2019re not promoting black female talent the way they used to, and when they do make minimal effort, it is for much younger artists than Braxton, who at the time of the interview was in her mid-30s.\n\nMeanwhile, reality television has proved itself to be a shrewd way to build an artist\u2019s fan base\u2014well, if the music doesn\u2019t suck and there is proper planning in place. Tamar Braxton, along with her husband, Vincent Herbert, skillfully used reality television to make Braxton the star her talent has long demanded that she be.\n\nSo, five years later, as Tamar Braxton releases Bluebird of Happiness, her fifth studio effort (yes, I am counting both her purposely forgotten debut album, Tamar, and her holiday-focused project, Winter Wonderland), it was peculiar to hear her declare to Entertainment Tonight that she will no longer be releasing albums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that I want to do, and a lot of things that are in the works,\u201d she explained to ET. It\u2019s a curious statement given that since the premiere of Braxton Family Values, Braxton has been doing a constant juggling act. She has become a daytime talk show host, a contestant on Dancing With the Stars, a touring act.\n\nWhen Braxton announced her decision to leave The Real, it was noted that she would be shifting focus to her solo career. Of course, we soon learned that the \u201cmutual decision\u201d for her to exit the show was anything but. Nonetheless, Braxton always made it appear that music was the top priority, so that if she no longer had daytime TV, she still had a booming music career.\n\nWhat could possibly have changed her mind? \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that are going on in my relationship and me being close to this music industry, and whatever I can do to eliminate all of the stress and problems off of my relationship, I would rather do that,\u201d Braxton noted to ET. She went on to say, \u201cMy husband and I work very close together and it\u2019s really hard, you know?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for what is apparently her final album, Braxton\u2019s husband \u201ccalls it my best work yet.\u201d\n\nI would say that Braxton\u2019s woefully underappreciated last album, Calling All Lovers, deserves those bragging rights more, but Bluebird of Happiness is yet another fine effort from the youngest Braxton\u2014the one Toni Braxton named as the best singer of the family. Tamar Braxton has always complained about her first album sounding \u201ctoo much like Toni Braxton,\u201d but when you line that album up with the others, they all sound similar. Yes, many of the songs scream \u201curban adult contemporary,\u201d but there\u2019s never been anything wrong with that.\n\nTamar Braxton makes adult records, but she\u2019s never sounded old. Her flair has always been inserted in her music. There\u2019s always been some degree of youthfulness and spunk to much of what she releases. There\u2019s constantly some oomph from her records that comes across as effortless, whereas it sometimes feels out of character coming from her big sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s more pronounced in tracks like the Yo Gotti-featuring \u201cHol\u2019 Up,\u201d but it\u2019s also evident in songs like \u201cWanna Love You Boy,\u201d which interpolates Robin Thicke\u2019s \u201cWanna Love You Girl,\u201d and \u201cMy Forever.\u201d It\u2019s also true of \u201cRun Run,\u201d though the trend of American singers faking a Jamaican accent in song should finally be left behind before the year ends. That song would be better without it, which is why I skip it to return to more ear-pleasing works like \u201cPick Me Up,\u201d which features another interpolation, this one of Evelyn Champagne King\u2019s \u201cLove Come Down.\u201d In fact, there is yet another on \u201cThe Makings of You,\u201d which features Gladys Knight.\n\nAlthough I generally worry when contemporary acts rely too heavily on interpolations, given that simply re-creating what listeners have already shown they love sometimes feels lazy, it doesn\u2019t matter to me on Bluebird of Happiness because, simply put, Braxton sounds so good over everything she\u2019s singing. For those who prefer her as a balladeer, the bottom half of the album will prove pleasing.\n\nEven as an independent artist (Braxton recently broke with her label, Epic Records, and her husband has been ordered to pay its parent company, Sony, $3.7 million), Braxton has continued to find success, and Bluebird of Happiness\u2019 lead single, \u201cMy Man,\u201d has performed well on the charts. Moreover, Braxton will be touring on Xscape\u2019s reunion tour alongside Monica. Much of that has to do with the fact that once Braxton finally got another shot at solo stardom, she made the most of it.\n\nSo, again, why is she quitting? Yes, I heard that it\u2019s for the preservation of her marriage, but is there no alternative? Could she simply stop working with her husband in that capacity and they could enjoy each other as just man and wife rather than as business partners? Many people who are deeply in love can\u2019t be co-workers. To walk away from that situation sounds reasonable, but not so much walking away from a career that she has publicly complained about wanting for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who enjoyed Tamar Braxton in the girl group with her sisters Trina Braxton and Toward Braxton; who actively listens to the 2000 album she loathes and rarely, ever wants to discuss; and who remembers the false starts of a comeback, like when she signed with Tommy Mottola\u2019s Casablanca Records, I\u2019m a bit disappointed that she suddenly wants to abandon it all. Frankly, I don\u2019t get it, but perhaps it\u2019s not for me to get. Ultimately, it\u2019s her decision and, based on her social media commentary, one in which she is steadfast. Such is her right, even as the fans who have been quietly rooting for her for so long\u2014as much as a a decade, in many of our cases\u2014are left stumped by the sudden rush to drop a dream.\n\n\n\nNow, as for whether or not Bluebird of Happiness is the kind of project to end her catalog with, Braxton\u2019s most ardent fans, the Tamartians, will spend the months ahead debating that. I vote no. The album is good, but considering that it is presently being sold as her final project, it disappoints to an extent because after each listen, you\u2019re left with the feeling that she\u2019s got so much music left in her.", "keywords": ["bluebird", "theres", "shes", "wanted", "album", "records", "happiness", "star", "quitting", "braxton", "music", "love", "solo", "husband", "long", "tamar", "finally"], "polarity": 0.18311395018712082, "subjectivity": 0.43005871725383943},

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself.

Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense. And it was good.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Edition cast members: My first reaction was to objectify the adult actors, but I\u2019ll tuck in the thot and just say that, once again, they were fantastic. I really wish Luke James could score a moment with his own music. He\u2019s a phenomenal Johnny Gill, but we need to get him some music that\u2019ll let him body-roll and sing like that with his original music.\n\n\n\nThe real New Edition: BET has really earned back its investment with the movie. Bobby Brown\u2019s mint accessory made my night, and I like that even if he\u2019s moving a lil\u2019 slower these days, he still keeps up. If that set was a tour commercial, they succeeded with me.\n\nSZA: She sounded great\u2014awful opening that was no fault of her own notwithstanding. However, she probably should have performed in the first or second hour. The sequencing of performances felt off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nTamar Braxton: Tamar Braxton can sing exceptionally well, but she was not singing a lick during her performance of \u201cMy Man.\u201d So why she was aggressively moving her wig like it was dipped in a fire ant bed before she glued it to her head is beyond me. I saved this for last because it was the absolute most.\n\nAll right, before I (let) go:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers to Solange.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd Remy Ma for those wins.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye, blacks.\n\n", "keywords": ["forever", "felt", "say", "bet", "awards", "song", "chicken", "songz", "music", "love", "entertained", "let", "dont", "performance"], "polarity": 0.18189406065456484, "subjectivity": 0.5161022287702961},

On Tuesday, Donald Trump not only fired the secretary of state\u2014and stand-in for every daytime soap opera\u2019s mean oil baron\u2014Rex Tillerson, but he also got rid of some guy named John McEntee, who was his personal assistant.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, McEntee was let go because of issues surrounding his security clearance. McEntee could be heard screaming, \u201cThis is bullshit! Jared Kushner\u2019s ass couldn\u2019t get clearance to ride on a Greyhound bus, but I\u2019m fired?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFine, McEntee wasn\u2019t heard screaming, but his ass was reportedly escorted out of the White House\u2014according to one official, he didn\u2019t even have a chance to take any of his belongings, not even his jacket\u2014because escorting people out of places where they have been fired is mad degrading and I\u2019m here for it. I want to have security at my next house party just so I can randomly walk through and ask that someone who doesn\u2019t use a coaster be escorted out and then look at them like an evil slave owner as they feebly attempt to explain with their eyes that it was all a mistake.\n\nDoes any of us know who McEntee is? Of course not. Does it matter that he\u2019s been fired? Well, kind of. The Trump administration has been a mess since infancy. Clearly the president is in over his head in policy he doesn\u2019t understand, and anyone who tries to tell him different is getting the big boot. Speaking of big boots, I\u2019m totally fine with cutting Florida off the map at any point ... because ...

Men who don\u2019t put the messenger-bag strap across their body can\u2019t be trusted, and McEntee\u2019s ill-advised handling of his messenger bag proves that he didn\u2019t deserve to be in the Beverly Hillbillies White House.\n\nA White House official told WSJ, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be great for morale.\u201d\n\nWelp, that\u2019s it, folks, nothing more to see here. McEntee was at the White House and now he isn\u2019t, and while none of us knew who he was, he will be missed. I guess. Also, something tells me that Trump isn\u2019t done letting people go. He\u2019s like the uncle who once threw three touchdowns in a junior varsity nonconference game and can\u2019t stop talking about it at every Thanksgiving even though he\u2019s 74 years old and was in high school in the 1950s.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

True enough, the show started to sag a bit in 2014, but just a month later, it was being celebrated for besting the likes of Meredith Vieira's now canceled show in ratings.\n\nHowever, there is a more recent story about how the show is once again suffering from a ratings drop that has it matching its series low. It remains to be seen whether the show will bounce back as it has in the past\u2014although, if you\u2019ve followed the new season thus far, it might not be surprising to see this show remain in struggle mode.\n\nWhile the remaining four co-hosts\u2014Tamera Mowry-Housley, Jeannie Mai, Adrienne Bailon and Loni Love\u2014are all lovely people, there is something noticeably missing from the show. That something is the former co-host who sat farther to the left and who continues to be what I feel is the real-life version of that old BET-made animation known as Cita.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever one makes of the youngest Braxton sister, she\u2019s certainly never been dull. Now more than ever, I miss her interjecting her opinion whenever the mood suited her. The same goes for her beginning statements with, \u201cI mean \u2026 \u201d and \u201cWelll \u2026 \u201d and \u201cTuh, girl \u2026 \u201d Ditto for her rolling her eyes and sucking her teeth.\n\nWait. I cannot forget my favorite: the very high-pitched, \u201cYou tried it!\u201d\n\nThing is, if you\u2019re going to copy The View, which birthed the basis of this show, as well as The Talk and others, you\u2019ve got to be committed. What both The View and even The Talk understood is that when you create a winning formula, you have to commit to it. For The Real, it\u2019s five different types of women on one panel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMowry-Housley is the nice, polite Christian woman who married that nice man from Fox News. Mai is that spunky person with the mom who could easily do her job and everyone else\u2019s, TBH. Bailon is loud, no longer a Cheetah Girl from 3LW, and does a great job emulating Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d strut at the beginning of the show. Love is loud, cracks jokes and will, I guess, fuss at you when necessary to spread viral content online.\n\nWell, they\u2019re all loud\u2014except for Mowry-Housley\u2014but with Braxton\u2019s absence, now more than ever, we can tell that not all loud people are created equal. Who remembers when 702 sisters Irish and Orish Grinstead tried to continue on with the group without Meelah, replacing her with a singer named Cree Le\u2019More? They recorded the lead single \u201cPootie Tangin\u2019\u201d for the Chris Rock film Pootie Tang, which flopped, and then Meelah ultimately came back.\n\nThe Real without Tamar Braxton is basically the song \u201cPootie Tangin\u2019.\u201d\n\nBraxton will not be coming back to the old group, though. She\u2019s already working with Steve Harvey on a new daytime talk show called The Tamar Braxton Show. One wonders how Braxton will carry a talk show all her own, but for the people producing The Real, it\u2019s time to stop playing and find a replacement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one will be another Tamar Braxton, but the right person can bring her own unique energy to the group and give the show the jolt it needs to move forward before it\u2019s too late. There is room for error, of course. Farrah Franklin didn\u2019t help fans get over LeToya Luckett, or LaTavia Roberson, but we did have many great moments with Michelle Williams and the group as DC3.\n\nWhen you watch The Real now, it\u2019s like Diana Ross left the Supremes and the remaining four can\u2019t even give the viewers \u201cUp the Ladder to the Roof.\u201d Hurry, y\u2019all, \u2019cause in the land of daytime TV, y\u2019all will get y\u2019all\u2019s real asses canceled fast.

They filibustered, claimed they didn\u2019t like the public forum and noted that they felt that answering certain questions was inappropriate.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe noted that they had never been asked to intervene in an ongoing investigation. Both National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats soft-shoed their way around the question, adding that they didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to discuss specifics about conversations they\u2019d had with the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for me to address that in a public session,\u201d Coats said in response to questioning by the committee\u2019s ranking Democratic member, Mark Warner (D-Va.), ABC News reports.\n\n\n\nAnd Rogers testified:\n\nIn the three-plus years that I have been director of the National Security Agency, to the best of my recollection, I have never been directed to do anything I believe to be illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate, and to the best of my recollection, during that same period of service, I do not recall ever feeling pressured to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner wasn\u2019t fooled by all the double-talk.\n\n\u201cI understand your answer. I\u2019m disappointed with your answer,\u201d Warner said in response to Rogers, later adding: \u201cI hope you will understand the enormous need for the American public to know.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the truth is that none of the men who testified Wednesday give a thin hair on a rat\u2019s ass about the American public. The rest of the hearing was each one using different phrases to say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s when Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) came through, grilling these bamas. For King, he wanted answers as to why none of them were willing to answer anything. King wanted to know why they weren\u2019t answering questions as to whether they had had conversations with the president, or whether or not they had conversations with now former FBI Director James Comey about Trump.\n\n\u201cIs there some prohibition in the law that I\u2019m not familiar with that you can\u2019t discuss an item that you\u2019ve been asked directly?\u201d King asked McCabe, Mediate reports.\n\nMcCabe replied that it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to answer the question. King stayed on him until it was clear that he wasn\u2019t going to answer anything, and then King turned his attention to Roger and Coats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing wanted to know why Rogers wasn\u2019t answering, since he hadn\u2019t exercised executive privilege and the questions being asked weren\u2019t classified.\n\nRogers said, \u201cI feel it is inappropriate.\u201d\n\n\n\nKing shot back: \u201cWhat you feel isn\u2019t relevant, Admiral.

Now one of the biggest breaks in her post-Braxton Family Values career\u2014a slot on the hit daytime talk show The Real\u2014has come to an abrupt end. While the official announcement claimsthat it was a mutual decision, the first outlet to report the news notes that Braxton was fired\u2014something Braxton\u2019s own fiery Instagram post suggests, since it claims \u201cbackstabbing.\u201d Braxton didn\u2019t name names, but she did unfollow everyone on the show except for her now-former-co-host-closest-to-the-ideals-of-Jesus, Tamera Mowry-Housley.\n\nQuoting what it describes as a \u201cvery reliable source\u201d (Wendy Williams suggested that it was Loni Love on Monday\u2019s edition of The Wendy Williams Show), Love B. Scott reported: \u201cTamar Braxton just got fired from The Real. She wasn\u2019t reading too well with the audience and sales people didn\u2019t find her to be a good fit with advertisers. Also, production found her too difficult to deal with.\u201d\n\nOf course, when one reads phrasing like \u201cdidn\u2019t find her to be a good fit with advertisers,\u201d certain sensitivities are triggered. One of those includes the notion that maybe, just maybe, Tamar was too loud, and her rolling neck too active, to shill, oh, I don\u2019t know, diet products, kale chips, Cheetos or whatever else daytime TV typically advertises. My people, my people. I feel you, but not in this instance.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about The Real: Everyone on this show is loud minus Tamera, so while Tamar may be the real-life version of BET\u2019s old cartoon character Cita, Loni Love has a volume set just as high (Jesus\u2019 alarm clock).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a longtime fan of Tamar Braxton\u2019s (I listen regularly to the first album she pretends never happened), I think this is a teachable moment because I can totally see why Tamar might have gotten the boot. For one, she wasn\u2019t always the most pleasant person on the panel. Her eyes rolled as hard as my body does after my sixth tequila drink (save the judgment) and the DJ turns on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSorry.\u201d She tended to talk over her fellow panelists. She could be dismissive here and there of their feelings, too.\n\nIn sum, she treated her co-workers the way Towanda Braxton claims she treats her sisters. The problem, though, is that there is no Mama Braxton to come and save her from their criticism. Moreover, these are co-workers, not kinfolk. Production doesn\u2019t have to put up with you, especially once they realize that they don\u2019t need you to survive. So as special as Tamar Braxton is and as magnetic a personality many find her, we\u2019re all dispensable.\n\nShoutout to Star Jones and Rosie Perez.\n\nI\u2019m not Iyanla Vanzant, but I have a few suggestions for the littlest Braxton.\n\nFor one, stop taking to social media to discuss your messy work breakups. I can only imagine the betrayal and subsequent rage Tamar must be feeling, but if you\u2019re being accused of being a diva or combative, reading the girls on Instagram does little to negate that argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, while losing a gig certainly sucks, it does create an opportunity for Tamar Braxton, singer, to return to top priority. Tamar\u2019s second album was so well-done, but between TV shows one, two and three, it seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle. Tamar\u2019s voice is a gift, and I want more people to realize how good it is.\n\nThat would lead to more touring, more albums and just more from Tamar the artiste.\n\nCan she keep doing reality TV? Sure, get your money and use it to sell your music. But whew, if you can\u2019t get your morning face together for a daytime talk show, don\u2019t sign that contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would add more suggestions, but the reality is, talking too much and doing the most appear to be her biggest issues. Good luck, girl. I\u2019m rooting for you even if Loni, Adrienne, Jeannie and your producers can\u2019t be bothered.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

At least that\u2019s the conclusion of \u201cWhy It\u2019s Hard for Conservatives to Date in D.C. Right Now,\u201d a piece in The Washingtonian magazine that\u2019s become all the talk in Washington circles this week. Or at least some Washington circles.\n\nConservatives (mostly men) in the article lament that D.C. liberals would rather swipe left than settle in for a night of Tucker Carlson and chill. The dating deficit isn\u2019t just affecting the men, though. Conservative women who\u2019ve swarmed D.C. since Donald Trump got into office are forced to alter their dating choices, too. From The Washingtonian:\n\n\n\nConversely, a young White House staffer says she typically looks for someone from the South when swiping through profiles, as she thinks they\u2019ll be more receptive to her support of the President.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: She\u2019s looking for a white guy from the South. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not on BlackSinglesMeet.com scrolling for alumni from FAMU. Which got me thinking: Are black conservatives having the same dating problems as white conservatives in D.C.? Is there some lonely black Republican guy out there wondering why Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee never responded to his Diamond and Silk Chit Chat Live Evite? Is there some black Republican woman out there trying to turn men\u2019s heads who\u2019s frustrated because everyone thinks her \u201cLock Her Up\u201d T-shirt is advertising a new spot on 14th Street to get their braids done? I took an unofficial survey of every black Republican I know to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this polling has some limitations\u2014most of the black Republicans I know are already married, and it was hard finding LGBT black Republicans. I know a few, but to this day, I have yet to meet a black lesbian Republican. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, riding unicorns and paying for Janelle Mon\u00e1e tickets with four-leaf clovers dipped in vibranium, but I couldn\u2019t find any before deadline.\n\nThe vast majority of people I spoke to said that being a conservative or a Republican didn\u2019t hurt their D.C. dating prospects at all. If anything, it may have helped. The people I spoke to agreed to share their stories on the condition that their identities be kept secret. So The Root promised to be one of the few outlets in D.C. that WON\u2019T leak Republican testimony.\n\n\u201cMy boys introduce me as \u2018That\u2019s my Republican friend,\u2019 and women are, like, intrigued,\u201d said one prominent GOP state party member in his late 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know Republicans who get play, and I know some that are wack,\u201d said a Gen X Republican married to a woman who worked on former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cI mean, most folks don\u2019t bang with 45 like that, so if that\u2019s how you start and end every conversation, what do you expect?\u201d\n\nThe emerging theme was that being a black Republican wasn\u2019t as big a problem so long as:\n\nYou focused on the black part.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a Trump-supporting black person.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a problem for me,\u201d a millennial black Republican who works in media said. \u201cI mean, my girlfriend knows I\u2019m a black man. She knows that the lens through which I live my conservative politics is as a black man. Besides, her momma said, \u2018As long as he isn\u2019t one of those TRUMP conservatives,\u2019 and I definitely am not!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated lots of men I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said a 40-something black woman who works as a newspaper editor. \u201cBut Trump supporters are assholes!\u201d She noted that a co-worker set her up with a Trumper about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was very handsome, successful, but so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went on and on about how journalists should be locked up and how immigrants are ruining America.\u201d Clearly lapsing into the worst date of her life, \u201cAnd you know the worst part? He was a Jamaican immigrant!\u201d\n\nA lot of what I was hearing spoke to the way that black folks navigate \u201cparty\u201d politics versus universal issues when it comes to dating and mating. For many, being a Republican is like a form of code-switching, and potential dates accept that, but \u201cTrumpism\u201d is a lifestyle choice that will get you no love. I swear on a stack of secondhand copies of Gifted Hands that most black men and women in Washington would go on a date with a small-government, lower-taxes, pro-life potential bae, and even listen to some shading of Obama, but there are limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went on a few dates with a black Republican soon after I moved to D.C. Everything was cool until we started talking about Black Lives Matter and she turned into Stacey Dash. Not the \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d Stacey Dash, but Fox News, \u201cWe should cancel Black History Month and I hate BET even though I used to twerk in their videos,\u201d hypocritical Stacey Dash.\n\nI think this woman found political debates to be sexy, but by the time she was explaining why black folks shouldn\u2019t be given access to police dashcam and bodycam video because we\u2019d \u201cjust go crazy and riot,\u201d it was a wrap. I wanted to just give her a prepaid Metro card back to the sunken place, but I was too much of a gentleman; and besides, she probably would have liked it.\n\nMy extensive survey and lab work could only lead to one conclusion: Conservative white, Trump-loving people must suck at dating in D.C., because black conservatives aren\u2019t having these problems. Also, this isn\u2019t just a Trump issue; Breitbart complained about the same thing during the Obama administration, and Tomi Lahren\u2019s living Dorian Gray painting, Ann Coulter, said the same thing under Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why a whole article about it? What would compel a few \u201cMAGA\u201d-hat-wearing men and women to whine to The Washingtonian that their weekends are as empty as a Trump Christmas party?\n\n\u201cThat was just some \u2018woe is me\u2019 white-boy stuff right there,\u201d said the GOP state official. \u201cThey think they\u2019re entitled, but look, you enabled this guy [Trump]; you\u2019re complicit in what this country is going through. Why should anybody throw you the box?\u201d\n\nNever fear, though, young white conservatives. There are still some options for the less-than-discerning, Trump-supporting D.C. dater. Just know that the first 20 minutes might cost you about $130,000, but you definitely won\u2019t be judged for riding the Trump train.", "keywords": ["republican", "carlson", "men", "doing", "ones", "white", "dc", "know", "women", "trump", "conservatives", "date", "dating", "tucker", "black", "chill", "fine"], "polarity": -0.026833694083694067, "subjectivity": 0.4630097402597401},

Marshall (Getty Images)\n\nGrammy-nominated singer, reality-television regular and Braxton-family baby sister Tamar turned heads this week when she took to Instagram to post footage of her having her head shaved with the chorus of Bobby Brown\u2019s \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d playing in the background.\n\nThe diva\u2014as well-known for her array of hairstyles as for her multioctave voice\u2014has notably been estranged from her longtime husband, manager, reality-show co-star and co-parent Vincent Herbert since last year, amid rumors of physical and emotional abuse, accusations that Braxton refuted in December.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if shedding what often looked like a toxic relationship to viewers of WeTV\u2019s Tamar & Vince led Braxton to decide to shed her locks, but it\u2019s a major change to her look, which was heavily associated with wigs and weaves. Apparently, the big chop was done in honor of her 41st birthday, tomorrow on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which she playfully dubs \u201cSt. Tamar\u2019s Day.\u201d A post-shave Instagram post read:\n\n[I\u2019m] over feeling captive to a wig, weave, people, people\u2019s comments & opinions hell...even my OWN feelings! WE can choose to stop these things from having the power and victory over us!! And for me, that starts TODAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Braxton\u2019s declaration of her own liberation from pervasive beauty standards, the internet, of course, had to have its say, weighing in on a topic that, frankly, no one asked its opinion on (and before you @ me with rebuttals about the price of a public image, prove you\u2019ve never posted a selfie).\n\nWhile the response to seeing Braxton\u2019s beautiful face take center stage was overwhelmingly positive, inevitably, there were a few who felt the need to try to be cute\u2014as if Braxton\u2019s bold new look wasn\u2019t cute enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Instagram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople, please. It is the year 2018, and at this point, no one should have to explain why all of the above is problematic. Yes, we remember Britney Spears\u2019 infamous bald and window-bashing breakdown post-split from ex-husband Kevin Federline (and yes, we also know Spears covered \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d a few years before, but that does not an Easter egg hunt make).\n\nWe also know the bald warrior women of Black Panther\u2019s Dora Milaje are the hottest women to hit the screen so far in 2018. More importantly, we know that folks sound ass-backwards, transphobic and homophobic as hell when they compare a woman who decides to undergo the \u201cbig chop\u201d to a gender nonbinary person. Whatever kind of feelings it triggers in you, you might want to keep them to yourself, because it\u2019s not a good look, and nobody else\u2019s identity is really your business.\n\nAnd guess what? Even if you can\u2019t get over your outdated notions of sexuality and gender (and you really should, for your own sake), we also know plenty of cisgender straight men with long hair (hi, Jason Momoa) and plenty of cis straight women rocking beautiful bald fades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of that should really even matter. Like, for real: Grow the hell up.\n\nAs a woman who\u2019s undergone more than one big chop\u2014at times, to release the energy of the past, and sometimes solely for the sake of my hair health\u2014I can vouch that it\u2019s a very liberating experience. I can also attest that it didn\u2019t change the way I express my femininity in the least. In short (pun intended), this kind of sexist idiocy really pisses me off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, we think this is the prettiest and happiest that Tamar Braxton has looked in years\u2014and we hope she feels as good as she looks. That said, she might have a little work of her own to do, since her 4-year-old son snarkily called her \u201cMr. Mommy\u201d after seeing her new look.\n\n[Sigh.] Doing too much, indeed.

Even with multiple states legalizing the use of medicinal and/or recreational marijuana, the U.S. attorney general has made it his personal mission to squash that industry and those who participate in it like a bug. He even issued an order last month encouraging prosecutors to aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws.\n\nSessions\u2019 dedication to preventing anyone from being able to use marijuana legally is now being challenged in court. A federal lawsuit filed against Sessions and the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York City in July hit the docket Wednesday, the New York Times reports, and now both sides will have the opportunity to present their case before a judge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case include former NFL player Marvin Washington, who says his business interests in states where marijuana is legal are being impeded by the Controlled Substances Act. Washington argues that the act violates the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause. The second plaintiff is 12-year-old Alexis Bortell, who has epilepsy and says the law makes it impossible for her to travel legally with the only medication that has helped control her seizures.\n\nThe third plaintiff is the nonprofit Cannabis Cultural Association, a group that assists minorities in the marijuana industry. It claims that the Controlled Substances Act has been used to discriminate against minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph A. Bondy, one of the lawyers who brought the suit, told the Times: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time a young child who needs lifesaving medicine has stood up to the government to be able to use it. It\u2019s the first time that a group of young millennials of color has stood up to the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communities.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also points out blatant hypocrisy on the part of the U.S. government when it comes to marijuana. While the government claims that pot is a dangerous substance, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services obtained a patent on the compounds in marijuana in 2003 to protect against brain damage. In 2015, former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said publicly that marijuana has medical benefits.\n\nOn Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Dolinger asked Judge Alvin Hellerstein to dismiss the case because \u201ccourts around the country have considered similar or identical claims and have rejected them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Hiller, lead counsel for plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the hearing: \u201cThere is a well-established body of case law that when the facts change, the courts have to change, too. If you only decided case law based upon what people thought years before, we would never have Brown v. Board of Education. \u2026 We would never have Windsor. We wouldn\u2019t have marriage equality.\u201d\n\nJudge Hellerstein openly admitted in court that marijuana does not meet one of the three requirements for Schedule I drug status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYour clients are living proof of the medical applications of marijuana,\u201d Hellerstein said to Hiller during the hearing. \u201cI have to take the plausible allegations in your complaint as true.

And how could you possibly know the heart of someone who says something like, \u201cFor us, it is conquer or die. This is a unique burden for the white man\u201d? (That was Richard Spencer, by the way.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow could you possibly know the inner life of someone who thinks a German dictator who committed mass genocide had a pretty good point?

Dash has a long history of serving up her unwanted opinions on her blog and on Fox News, and had no reservations about judging others prior to this interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s repeatedly spoken out against former President Barack Obama. In 2016, while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, Dash said that Obama \u201cbamboozled us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all got blacked into it, \u201c she said, according to Essence.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t too concerned about knowing Jesse Williams\u2019 heart, either, when she called the actor a \u201cperfect example of a Hollywood plantation slave\u201d in a 2016 blog post after he spoke at the BET Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that you were standing on that stage at THOSE awards tells people you really don\u2019t know what your talking about. Just spewing hate and anger,\u201d Dash said, doling out harsher words to the Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor than she could muster giving to violent white supremacists.\n\nNor did Dash much care what was in the hearts of transgender activists fighting for their right to use the correct bathroom.\n\n\u201cOK, then go in the bushes,\u201d Dash said, also in 2016 (a real landmark year for knowing people\u2019s hearts, I suppose). \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, but I\u2019m not gonna put my child\u2019s life at risk because you want to change a law,\u201d Dash added, bringing up a long-held but completely false belief that trans people pose a danger to children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Dash couldn\u2019t find a word to mince when blogging about Black Lives Matter. Not only did she feel completely at home mocking one organizer, Aaron Goggans, for saying that black-on-black crime was a myth, but she also delivered a categorical condemnation of BLM\u2014despite not knowing their hearts: \u201cBlack Lives Matter is really a racist [movement] by definition\u2014providing a value based on the color of someones [sic] skin is Racist....

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

They were the kind of couple that threw amazing dinner and cocktail parties, who were the picture of love and affection everywhere they went, and generally made you feel good whenever you were around them. No one knows how long the breakup was pending, but when the news spread through our circle of friends, we were all collectively shook.\n\n\n\nWhen we finally recovered from the news of their breakup, a new panic spread among us: Who would get the friends after the breakup?\n\nThis may seem like a petty question to ask, but in some situations it is a real consideration after a breakup. People are often expected to choose sides in the split, and that can be an impossible dilemma when you are close to both people in the now dissolved relationship.\n\nIn my case, I have known both people for a very long time, and I am close to both of them. The shock of the breakup aside (neither of them told me shit, and I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t), I honestly don\u2019t want to have to choose one over the other because I love them both. I value both of them as friends. I want to be able to continue being friends with both of them.\n\nUnlike other breakups that involve cheating or a betrayal of some kind, theirs simply stems from their not wanting to be a couple any longer. As it was explained when the bombshell was dropped on me, they \u201cjust aren\u2019t compatible anymore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey don\u2019t have children (thankfully), so there is only their shared apartment to split up (he\u2019s moving; she\u2019s staying). They will divide up their shared belongings and disconnect their lives rather seamlessly.\n\nSo, again, who gets the friends?\n\nWhat is the proper etiquette for these situations?\n\nThey haven\u2019t said that we as friends have to choose, but you know those awkward moments are going to present themselves when we are having a group outing or a group dinner or a party or get-together somewhere and we have to decide: Do we invite him or her?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfortable. Undoubtedly they will eventually move on and start dating other people. No one wants to end up with a scene like the one that happened when Issa ran into Lawrence and Aparna at Derek\u2019s birthday party on Insecure. It\u2019s too messy, and no one wants to be messy.\n\nSo who decides? Do the friends make the choice themselves? Does the couple decide who gets to still hang with whom?\n\nHow do you navigate these relationships post-breakup?\n\nI will admit that the petty overtook me during my last breakup, and I specifically told my ex that he was not allowed to have contact with any of the people he knew only because of me. I told them that, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruth be told, it probably would have ended up working out that way anyway, because he\u2019s not exactly a social butterfly, and the idea of him reaching out to any of my friends to hang out was pretty preposterous in the grand scheme of things, but like I said\u2014I was petty, and I didn\u2019t even want him talking to them on social media. He didn\u2019t do that, either.\n\nIn that instance, it was my choice and he unwittingly obliged, but this is a couple known for being very social\u2014and the angst that it is creating in our friend circle got me wondering how we would figure all this out.\n\nWhat do you do when you break up with someone and you are friends with the same people? Do you make your friends choose? Do you choose?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you ever been in this situation before?\n\nThis is a point to ponder and discuss, so let me hear your thoughts in the comments.\n\nWe will be discussing \u201cWho gets the friends in the breakup?\u201d on our next The Root After Dark Twitter chat, Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT. I will take over The Root\u2019s official Twitter account as always, and we will chop it up.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

He was confident without being cocky. He was intense and intentional, direct and laid-back, funny, sexy and cool\u2014all at the same time.\n\nI liked the way he looked directly in my eyes as he was speaking to me and when he listened to me speak.

He turned on his iPod and we lay facing each other on the bed, talking.\n\nAfter what seemed like hours but may have only been minutes, I could tell we were going to kiss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomehow, gravity had pulled us closer together. My breasts were pressed into his chest. His arm was draped around my waist. Our noses were practically touching.\n\nHe looked at me\u2014as if checking to see if it would be OK\u2014and in response, I ran my tongue slowly across his lips.\n\nI felt like every nerve ending in my body was on fire. His kisses were gentle but urgent.

Come fall, there\u2019s saturated color, \u201990s-inspired silhouettes and a fair amount of fur to look forward to, so get ready.\n\nBut our favorite trend wasn\u2019t a trend at all; it was texture. Following several seasons in which we\u2019ve seen an uptick in black models wearing their natural tresses on the runways, this season\u2019s presentations boasted a remarkable number of naturally coiffed models on the catwalks. Even labels that typically cater to more conservative consumers, such as Tory Burch and Bottega Veneta, featured not only black models but black models sporting their natural textures in a variety of lengths, shapes and styles.\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to call it a trend, considering the fact that the past year has seen women in the armed forces wholeheartedly embracing the natural-hair movement, more natural-hair moments than ever on the red carpet, and 2018\u2019s biggest film starring a primarily black and entirely naturally styled cast, it\u2019s safe to say that #TeamNatural has gained more than a toehold in popular culture.\n\nAs model Kristina Elise told fashion site PopSugar: \u201cFor me, leaving my hair natural for the runway is really important. It means that the designer is embracing me how I am and not trying to make me like everyone else\u2014because my hair is not like everyone else\u2019s and it\u2019s not going to look the same. I really appreciate it when they make that decision.\u201d\n\nAnd while we know black is always in fashion, it\u2019s nice to see the fashion world actually taking notice.

People make fun of that saying, but if you think about it, it is a mood, a message and a lifestyle. Each year on Dec. 31, we shed at least some part of our old selves and take on new habits, ideas or mantras. For me, Dec. 31, 2017, was no exception.\n\n\n\nAs I sought to adopt a few new habits for 2018, I looked to 2017 to see what things I could leave behind, especially as it pertains to my love life. At the top of my list were the following five things that I will now share with you:\n\n1. Playing on My Phone\n\nI actually really did have a dude saved in my contacts as \u201cPlaying on my phone.\u201d I stopped answering his calls, and on Dec. 31 I actually deleted him from my contacts. He earned that name because he was constantly doing two things that irk me. He would either text me constantly asking, \u201cWhen can I see you?\u201d or send a text asking if he could come over, and when I said yes, he would say he was on his way, and then I wouldn\u2019t hear from him. This happened once every three encounters, and after a while, I just got sick of that shit.\n\nIt\u2019s totally my fault for letting him get away with it for as long as I did, but in my defense \u2026\n\nAnyway, in 2018, that shit is dead and canceled. No more playing on my phone for anyone\u2014no matter how good the zick is. Go play with somebody else.\n\n2. \u201cPotential\u201d\n\nI\u2019m done fucking with potential. Let me qualify that by saying there is nothing wrong with being a work in progress. We all are, if you think about it. Sometimes, though, the work that needs to be done is too detailed and too time-consuming, and it needs to be done on their time and not yours. There is also the problem of men wanting you to help them do the work on their potential, like it\u2019s a gotdamn Build-a-Bear Workshop. Fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI no longer have the time or the patience.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure there is someone out there looking at me who will say, \u201cShe has potential, but nah,\u201d and by all means, I encourage you to skip over me if potential is not your ministry, either. We too grown for this shit now.\n\n3. Explanations\n\nI\u2019m tired of explaining shit to dudes that they have probably already heard before and should already understand. Ain\u2019t no mo\u2019 explaining. If I am \u201cthe second person to tell\u201d you that, then you have heard it before and should have already been doing your homework. You are too old for me to be explaining to you why it\u2019s not OK for you to just pop up over my house. I don\u2019t care if you are calling from around the corner\u2014if we did not prearrange for you to come over and visit, the answer is \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith every \u201cno\u201d I give, there undoubtedly comes a \u201cWhy?\u201d I\u2019m done with \u201cwhy\u201d and done with explaining.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d is a complete fucking answer. Period. It requires no further explanation.\n\n4. \u201cFriends\u201d With No \u201cBenefits\u201d\n\nI was kinda already on this in 2017, but I am making a stronger commitment to it in 2018. Dudes are always surprised when they ask me if we can be friends with benefits, and I ask them what the benefit is. Just so we are clear: Dick is not the benefit. It never has been and it never will be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenises are like buses. Another one will be here in 10 minutes or less. So what else you got? Are you handy around the house? Are you good with cars? Can you hook my friend up with illegal cable? Can you put in on some of these bills? Like, what do you have to offer besides what\u2019s between your legs? I need answers. And real fucking benefits.\n\n5. Insecure Dudes\n\nThis last one is a biggie. I\u2019ve encountered it enough times to be sick of it. Usually I try to encourage dudes or make them feel better, but now I\u2019m like, fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am a Leo, and a gregarious, outgoing person by nature. I have a large following on Twitter, and now that I write for The Root, I have a large platform that brings me a lot of attention. I flirt. A lot. Flirting is harmless. It doesn\u2019t mean I want to date the object of the flirting or have sex with them or anything like that. Sometimes flirting is just flirting. In fact, a lot of times flirting is just flirting.\n\nI have had dudes who approached me because they like my outgoing, flirtatious personality suddenly feel some type of way when they get closer to me. They want me to turn down my personality and dim my light so that they feel more comfortable.\n\nTheir level of insecurity is not really my concern or my business; that\u2019s something for them to work out on their own time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere I used to try to be understanding and would often tone some things down to make them more comfortable, I realized that is changing who I am for another person, and again, FUCK THAT.\n\nSo insecure dudes have to go, too.\n\nIn summation, I had a glorious 2017, and I expect that 2018 is going to be even better. It is with that in mind that I make these changes, knowing that they will facilitate my happy new year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope you had a chance to think of some changes to make for yourself, too.\n\nHappy New Year!", "keywords": ["dudes", "leaving", "things", "work", "shit", "2017", "potential", "playing", "im", "starting", "flirting", "2018", "think", "fresh"], "polarity": 0.012024936868686869, "subjectivity": 0.5742025162337664},

Catch up with part 1.\n\n\n\nI was at ease with him almost immediately. All of his jokes (both corny and not) aside, there was something very sincere in the way he spoke to me\u2014a level of honesty was there that stood out and made itself noticed.\n\nHe was self-assured without being presumptuous. He was confident without being cocky. He was intense and intentional, direct and laid-back, funny, sexy and cool\u2014all at the same time.\n\nI liked the way he looked directly in my eyes as he was speaking to me and when he listened to me speak. I loved the way he used big words in the most unpretentious way.\n\nHe bought me drinks but didn\u2019t ply me with alcohol. He let me make requests but was proactive when it was required.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen my suitor and his brother asked if my friend and I wanted to come with them back to their hotel suite, me and my girl only had to glance at each other to know that we were both saying yes.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to throw caution to the wind when you feel comfortable with someone, but just to be safe, we sent pictures of him and his brother to her sister and told her where we were going.\n\nI have heard people say that a woman knows usually within moments of meeting a man if she\u2019s going to sleep with him or not\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of when.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know how true this is for other women, but speaking for myself, I would say that 9 times out of 10, that is definitely the case.\n\nIn the case of Mr. He Did That (HDT from now on), I certainly knew before we left the first bar\u2014but I also knew it wouldn\u2019t be on that first night.\n\nWe socialized as a group for a little over an hour in the living room of their suite before he took my hand and led me to his separate bedroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need some alone time,\u201d he said.\n\nWe were comfortably numb from all the alcohol.

Can I eat you?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI laughed and said \u201cSir\u201d loudly.\n\nMy girl laughed. He turned, unshaken, to look at her. He flashed a grin at her, then turned back toward me and looked expectantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most expensive dish on the menu, sir,\u201d I said. My girl laughed again. This time, I joined her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, he said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t tricking if you got it.\u201d\n\nThe next giggle caught in my throat.\n\nListen. If you are quick on your feet with the witty comebacks, you are well on your way to winning with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had my attention.\n\nWe bantered back and forth for a few minutes. I signaled the bartender for my check as he flirted with me.\n\nHe was smooth, and the lines he came with after that first one were clever and flattering.

She slowly rolled her eyes to the left, and I took in his homeboy for the first time.\n\nHe. Was. Not. Cute.\n\nMy girl could tell I was warming up to my guy, and she gave me the look, like, Bitch, you better not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Man had signed the bill and was already asking me what we were planning to do next.\n\nI made up some vague story about us having another spot to hit, and he continued smooth-talking me and my girl until we were convinced to go along with them to another bar, where we were joined by his brother.\n\nIn an effort to both give me and my girl a moment to ourselves and not look like a creep, he arranged for us to ride in two separate Lyfts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy girl was only slightly annoyed, but she warned me that if his brother wasn\u2019t cute, we were leaving the next bar as soon as we walked in.\n\nHis brother was very cute.\n\nWe hung out with the three of them until very late, drinking, laughing, listening to music and having a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Man and his brother invited us back to their hotel suite.

Aside from appearing both in the most recent Star Wars release and in episode 1 of this season of Black Mirror, she\u2019s co-starring in the English musical film Been So Long, due out later this year on Netflix.\n\nSuffice to say, whether choosing a challenging new role or impressing us with her yoga skills on her highly entertaining Instagram page, Michaela Coel likes to push herself to new limits, and her hair is no exception. This chameleon loves to switch up her style, transitioning from her closely cropped natural to any number of wigs at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nAnd for those who take notice with judgment on the brain, this past weekend, she had this to say while rocking a pink ombre-dyed bobbed wig: \u201cSome of the righteous rally see my shaved head and start talking trash about my wig gang. I\u2019m pro-choice, pro never be oppressed and never let your wig or \u2019fro box you. Let no one box you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to hair, we consider ourselves #TeamNeutral here at The Glow Up, so we love Coel\u2019s message of autonomy and unconditional self-acceptance.

For some, it will be the last night they can stay up as late as they want before starting out a new year at work Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\nThey say the way you bring in your new year is indicative of how you will spend the year, so bringing in the new year by having a romantic evening with your love (or someone you are into) is a perfect way to start things off right, right?\n\nNow, if you are going to do this, then please do it right. If you put a half-assed effort into it, your love life for the new year is probably going to look half-assed as well. Get off to a good start.\n\nSee what I did there?\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nCreate a playlist of all your favorite sexy and mood-enhancing songs. I personally have a playlist that is specifically for boning, and I know I am not alone in this. Crank that baby up and play it throughout the evening on repeat. Include plenty of Prince slow songs (they all nassy!) and Marvin Gaye at his wailing best.\n\nA romantic picnic in the middle of your living room on a thick, soft blanket or even in the middle of your bed would definitely set the right tone. Eat enough to feel satisfied, but not so much that you can\u2019t participate in the action later. The meal you eat should be delicious, but not one that is overly heavy or one that will lead to unfortunate side effects like painful gas and bloating. None of that is sexy, and none of that will lend itself well to a night that ends with good sex. Think light finger foods that you feed each other.\n\nGet a few good bottles of wine. Avoid heavy alcohol because while it may sound good in theory, if you have ever suffered your way through vodka or whiskey dick, you know that this is not ever a good idea. A good, full-bodied wine such as malbec or merlot will be good to give you just the right amount of buzz without turning the evening into a drunken nightmare. Drunken sex is just not very sexy.\n\nGet the ambience and atmosphere right. Dim the lights and make use of scented candles. The most popular store for body products and household scented items is having a huge sale right now, and its three-wick candles are currently only $10 each. Run over and get a few, but make sure the scents are not heavy\u2014just light enough to tickle the nose and give the house a good aroma. An alternative to candles is night-lights. I know you may not have used them since you were a kid, but strategically placed night-lights can create a romantic mood without being intrusive.\n\nWear something sexy. It doesn\u2019t have to be lingerie\u2014it could be that romper you got on sale after Thanksgiving and have been waiting for warmer weather to wear. Wear something to be peeled out of. Make it an adventure for your partner. Give your partner something to look at and something to do later. It will be fun for both of you.\n\nRemember that foreplay is important for both of you and can be the best part of the evening. Make a game out of it. Test the limits of each other\u2019s nerve endings. Bring in the new year discovering or rediscovering your partner\u2019s body.\n\nHave whatever protection you are going to use close by. Nothing is more of a mood killer than fumbling around to try to find the protection. If you are planning to use condoms, have them set out already in a cute, decorative bowl near your love nest. Make them easily accessible and readily available. And have plenty of them. This could be a long night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is just one of many ways to have a good night on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nHowever you choose to spend it, and whomever you choose to spend it with, be safe and have fun.\n\nAnd remember that when you come home from that first day back at work in 2018, The Root After Dark will be here to keep you company that night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHappy New Year!", "keywords": ["romantic", "know", "spend", "eve", "good", "way", "happy", "evening", "right", "love", "sexy", "night"], "polarity": 0.23952009528932613, "subjectivity": 0.5187538956769726},

To that end, the DOJ ended an effort put in place by the Obama administration to investigate and publicize police department shortcomings.\n\nAs a result, 14 police departments nationwide that had either received reports from the DOJ\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services or were waiting to receive reports were left dangling in the wind. COPS also made reform recommendations to troubled departments and provided guidance and technical support.\n\nOne such department was the San Francisco Police Department. After a six-month investigation of the SFPD in 2016, COPS found disparities in traffic stops, post-stop searches and use of deadly force against African Americans, as well as implicit and institutionalized bias against minority groups.\n\nCOPS released its findings in a 432-page report and made nearly 300 recommendations for reform, which it would have overseen if not for Sessions\u2019 ending of the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the absence of DOJ oversight, the California Department of Justice announced Monday that it will oversee the efforts of SFPD to implement the reforms suggested by COPS, Mother Jones reports.\n\nAt a press conference, San Francisco\u2019s interim Mayor Mark Farrell said, \u201cWe made a promise to our residents and to our communities that we were going to transform our Police Department\u2014and partnering with [California] Attorney General [Xavier] Becerra will allow us to follow through on that pledge.\u201d\n\nThe COPS investigation of SFPD was prompted by the shooting death of Mario Woods at the hands of San Francisco police in December 2015. The investigation looked into six areas, identified 94 findings and provided 272 recommendations for improvement within the Police Department. The investigation found serious deficiencies in the way the department collects, maintains and analyzes data related to officer use of force. In addition, COPS suggested that the use-of-force policies in place for the department were out-of-date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMother Jones reports that current San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said the department has already made progress on more than half of the recommended changes, including banning officers from shooting at moving vehicles and approving a plan to equip police with Tasers. The state will now evaluate the department\u2019s progress and issue regular public reports.\n\nAnd that\u2019s all anyone wants, right? Police accountability is important. Police should not be able to act with impunity. They should not be able to operate like armed gangs. They should be called out when they do wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m proud of my home state for taking this on.\n\nOther states should follow suit.", "keywords": ["suggested", "wont", "recommendations", "california", "department", "investigation", "doing", "departments", "hold", "bad", "sfpd", "sessions", "jeff", "accountable", "cops", "reports", "san", "francisco"], "polarity": 0.07877747252747253, "subjectivity": 0.43606297548605244},

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have to fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on the air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["men", "totally", "real", "history", "lightskinned", "walkoff", "envys", "dj", "moment", "envy", "passiveaggressive", "desus", "tantrum", "wife", "mero", "radio"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

We\u2019d consumed plenty of tequila and were laughing and talking when I saw him out of the corner of my eye.\n\nYou can always tell when someone is sizing you up\u2014at least, I can. I could feel him looking at me even before I turned to see who it was.

I flashed my cutest and slyest smize before returning my attention to my drink.\n\nIt worked.\n\nHe made his way over to us, and I pretended not to notice him as I laughed at something my friend said that wasn\u2019t even that funny.

Can I eat you?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI laughed and said \u201cSir\u201d loudly.\n\nMy girl laughed. He turned, unshaken, to look at her. He flashed a grin at her, then turned back toward me and looked expectantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most expensive dish on the menu, sir,\u201d I said. My girl laughed again. This time, I joined her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, he said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t tricking if you got it.\u201d\n\nThe next giggle caught in my throat.\n\nListen. If you are quick on your feet with the witty comebacks, you are well on your way to winning with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had my attention.\n\nWe bantered back and forth for a few minutes. I signaled the bartender for my check as he flirted with me.\n\nHe was smooth, and the lines he came with after that first one were clever and flattering. He never took his eyes off me, even when his friend walked up and stood just off to the side of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bartender put my check down, he immediately snatched it up.\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said. He took out an American Express card and slipped it inside without even looking at the bill.\n\nMe and my girl looked at each other and smirked.\n\nIt was a player move. He wanted us to know that the amount of the bill was of no consequence to him; he carries no balances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see you, sir, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cWe can pay for our own check,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, please,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\nMore banter. As we talked, I had my phone in my hand because I was live-tweeting everything that was happening. In that moment, everything is funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAre you texting your boyfriend?\u201d he asked.\n\nI laughed and looked back at my girl again, who was giving me the look. She slowly rolled her eyes to the left, and I took in his homeboy for the first time.\n\nHe. Was. Not. Cute.\n\nMy girl could tell I was warming up to my guy, and she gave me the look, like, Bitch, you better not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Man had signed the bill and was already asking me what we were planning to do next.\n\nI made up some vague story about us having another spot to hit, and he continued smooth-talking me and my girl until we were convinced to go along with them to another bar, where we were joined by his brother.\n\nIn an effort to both give me and my girl a moment to ourselves and not look like a creep, he arranged for us to ride in two separate Lyfts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy girl was only slightly annoyed, but she warned me that if his brother wasn\u2019t cute, we were leaving the next bar as soon as we walked in.\n\nHis brother was very cute.\n\nWe hung out with the three of them until very late, drinking, laughing, listening to music and having a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Man and his brother invited us back to their hotel suite.

He told Magnolia that he was not involved with Lily and she was making sexual jokes with him on the timeline out of \u201cnowhere.\u201d He told Gardenia that Magnolia was forcing him to choose between the two of them. He told Lily that he only talked to Magnolia about business, and there was nothing else between them.\n\nHe repeatedly ran between the three women dropping nuggets of incendiary gossip of the \u201cshe said, she said\u201d type in what the women imagine was an attempt to make them openly fight over him. No one took the bait.\n\nIn case that last part was too long or unclear, Jeremiah the Liar is basically a messy bitch who lives for drama.\n\n\n\nNothing about how this fraud presented himself either online or in their private conversations was real\u2014not even his name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nMagnolia was the first to confront him with the truth. He told her that unlike with her, the conversations he had with the other two women were \u201ctrivial\u201d and didn\u2019t extend beyond texting here and there. He wasn\u2019t as into them as he was her, and he didn\u2019t see his relationships with them as being real.\n\n\n\nMagnolia told him that he was full of shit. She told him that he was wild and reckless and that he needed to talk to the other two women and be honest about what he had been doing. She told him he needed to own it. He \u201capologized\u201d and said he would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe called Gardenia later that night and told her that of the three women, she was the one he had been the most honest with. She knew more of his truth than the other two did. He apologized to her for being \u201cwild and reckless.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\n\nGardenia told him that his behavior was pathological and he needed to seek help. Then she hung up on him.\n\nThe next morning, Jeremiah the Liar called Lily. He told her that he had apologized to both Gardenia and Magnolia. She openly confronted him about the personal information the three women had discovered about him. He admitted to some of it, then asked her why he couldn\u2019t decide what personal information he shared with people online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt ceased being an online conversation when you moved it off of Twitter and onto our phones,\u201d she advised him.\n\nJeremiah the Liar played the victim and told her he was just trying to apologize. He said he would understand if none of them ever talked to him again. He didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three women decided as a group to go against normal Twitter protocol. They would not expose him or air him out on the timeline. None of them wanted to be part of a messy Twitter drama saga, and none of them wanted harm to come to the innocent people who could be collateral damage if they were to do such a thing.\n\n\n\nHe was spared the embarrassment.\n\nThe moral of the story is, as I said earlier, this is a very common occurrence on Twitter. There are plenty of men who are single on the timeline and married in real life. Single on the timeline with a girlfriend hiding in the wings. Single on the timeline and engaging in extensive private conversations with multiple women behind the scenes, none of whom know about the others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s messy. Their lack of honesty often leads to multiple people getting hurt.\n\nThe reasons they do this are many. Some, like SpongeBob Pajama Pants, have low self-esteem and get off on the idea of multiple women wanting them. Some are just bored and looking for the attention they aren\u2019t getting in their real life. Some are emotionally manipulative, egocentric assholes who thrive on this type of behavior.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll are emotionally immature boys in man bodies who don\u2019t think far enough to realize how their actions impact the real-life people on the other side of those interactions.\n\n\n\nSo, ladies, pay attention. Look for the signs. If something seems like it\u2019s not right, it probably isn\u2019t. If he seems too secretive or you believe that he is withholding information, approach with caution.\n\nDon\u2019t let yourself be the next Magnolia, Gardenia or Lily.\n\nBeware of the lying Twitter man-whore.", "keywords": ["didnt", "manwhore", "liar", "lily", "women", "lying", "told", "timeline", "beware", "magnolia", "caught", "gardenia", "twitter", "jeremiah"], "polarity": 0.11316115702479342, "subjectivity": 0.4529122392758754},

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference. Sessions, who was head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team, can answer questions on the campaign\u2019s ties to the Russians as well as on whether or not Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nRemember, Trump was very upset when Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation last year and even said in an interview that he never would have given Sessions the job of attorney general if he had known that was going to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, Sessions has tea to spill.\n\nThis is all leading up to the eventual interview between Trump and Mueller, during which the president will likely be questioned about his decisions to send both Flynn and Comey packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s team are already preparing themselves for the inevitable.

But just as frequently, my dreadlocks and scalp kick my ass just as hard as my fitness regimen. And when I try to recruit a new fitness buddy, I\u2019m frequently met with frustrating rejections because of worries about their tresses; whether they\u2019ve taken the chemically relaxed route to straighten their hair or are sporting their naturally kinky coils.\n\nAs a woman of color and a fitness nut, I want to eliminate some of the anxieties from your beauty regimen and incorporate great ways to get you back in the gym. If you\u2019re committed to getting fit, here are some sweat-ready hairstyles you may want to consider:\n\n\n\nBe Protective With Braids, Twists and Cornrows\n\nProtective styles such as braids and cornrows tend to be naturally low-maintenance. These styles minimize breakage from frequent styling or various heat applications, keeping your hair intact while you work it out. After kicking ass in the gym, consider unraveling your braids and sporting a twist-out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPull It Back in a Ponytail or Bun\n\nPonytails and buns are not only easy, but versatile. Pop that hair to one side for a fun \u201980s-inspired look, or go for a classic high bun for a night out on the town after releasing all of those endorphins. Or tap into old Hollywood with a playful twist, similar to this chignon on Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay With a Short Do\n\nRegardless of what hair type you have, a short cut can accentuate your natural features while maintaining your chic. If done well, shorter hairstyles require less styling time than their longer counterparts. Tap into your inner Nefertiti with a fabulous high-top, or take your cues from Halle Berry and mimic her legendary gorgeous short haircuts.\n\n\n\nHide It in a Head Wrap\n\nPlenty of women\u2014including myself\u2014have embraced wearing head wraps because of their versatility and practicality. Interestingly enough, there\u2019s an abundance of head-wrap history in African and Afro-Brazilian culture. If you\u2019re curious, check out this Nigerian Ankara head-wrap tutorial, or follow Franchesca Ramsey\u2019s one-minute video on how to rock that printed scarf that\u2019s been collecting dust for months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevote Yourself to Dreadlocks\n\nDon\u2019t chop my head off. Yes, I did say I go through issues, too, but honestly, dreadlocks are very forgiving. However, please bear in mind that they are permanent. But like some of the aforementioned styles, you can cornrow your dreadlocks into braids, throw them into a sloppy bun or keep them in place with a stylish head wrap. If you don\u2019t want to commit, consider faux locs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe Unbeweavable\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about my girls who love their sew-ins. While this is not just a tip for women who wear weaves, I heavily suggest wearing a headband or scarf to protect your edges. Wrap your hair and place a stocking cap on top before using a silk scarf or cap on top; that will allow you to protect your tresses and look presentable.\n\n\n\nBut wait: Here\u2019s a bit more info on protecting your hair while perfecting your health:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to Do When Your Workout Is Done\n\nIf you have the ability, wash your hair with a good shampoo. When my locs require TLC, I prefer natural remedies, like soaking my hair for 10 minutes in an apple-cider vinegar wash to remove impurities from my locs. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d suggest doing all of the time\u2014doing this too much can screw up your hair\u2019s pH balance.\n\nIn between washes, using a dry shampoo on your roots goes a long way toward removing dirt and residue from your hair. After your workout, spritz your scalp with coconut oil, an olive oil sheen or even tea tree oil. For those who wear locs or braids, take it a step further by using peppermint or rosemary oil to remove any musty scents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your hair or scalp is damp underneath your sew-in, blow-dry your hair on a lower setting. A moist, sweaty scalp can lead to a foul odor and retain buildup, damaging your actual hair. And applying too much heat on a regular basis will cause hair breakage.\n\n\n\nRemember to alternate your hairstyles every now and then. Some days, I allow my hair to do its own thing. Brushing or pulling your hair in the same direction can cause traction alopecia over time\u2014and nobody has time for that.\n\nI may not have all of the answers to your specific hair-care needs, but at the intersection of beauty and fitness, I hope this aids you in getting back into a regimen that you love.\n\n", "keywords": ["styles", "head", "braids", "oil", "scarf", "fitness", "reluctant", "scalp", "short", "haircare", "tresses", "protect", "hair", "tips", "enthusiast", "using"], "polarity": 0.16237208147044208, "subjectivity": 0.4462535824830907},

Let\u2019s talk about the wrong way first.\n\nDudes who do it the wrong way are timid. They act like they are afraid to put their tongue to that thing and get to work. They might just touch the tip of their tongue to it, which is the most ineffective and nonpleasurable shit ever.\n\nThen there are the ones who lap at it like it\u2019s a bowl of water and they are a big, sloppy dog.

They hit the spot maybe once every 10 licks, and you are lying there like, \u201cWhy did I bother?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, of course, there are the ones who give it the college try, but despite their best efforts\u2014they keep missing the spot entirely.\n\nImagine you have an itch in the middle of your back. You can\u2019t reach it, so you ask someone else to scratch it for you, and they keep missing it. Like, they scratch all around it but never actually scratch the itch?\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is bad head.\n\nIf you want to do it the right way, take your time. Get to know her. The vagina is your friend. Lick her the right way, and she will weep tears of joy for you. Maybe use a finger first to find her pleasure spot and then go to town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to suck the clitoris\u2014it\u2019s your friend. Sucking it gently and playing around it with your tongue are the keys to the universe. All of a woman\u2019s secrets come out with good head.\n\nIt\u2019s like playing an instrument. You can make her hit that high note if you tune her up right.\n\nI know a lot of you watch porn, so I will save you some wasted effort: Sticking your tongue inside her is cute and all, but if you want to win the game, start with a slow lick inside the labia, and when it becomes too much, work your way to the clit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you get lost, ask for directions.\n\nPay attention to her responses. When she\u2019s squirming, digging her fingers into your scalp and smothering you with her thighs, you are on a roll.\n\nIf she\u2019s lying there quietly, barely breathing\u2014you have a lot of work to do.\n\nThe way you go downtown can make or break a relationship. It\u2019s just like real life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking the route with all the traffic that keeps you stuck in the car for hours?

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor.

The moment you sit in the chair and the stylist wraps the cape around you is the moment you begin to be magically transformed.\n\n\n\nBut the mythology\u2014and reality\u2014of black beauty shops isn\u2019t just about the stylists; it\u2019s the culture, the rhythm. It\u2019s the lady up the street who takes lunch and dinner soul food orders and the brotha with bootleg movies stopping through on a Saturday morning; the gospel music in some spots and the hip-hop or trap music in others. It\u2019s generations of women from one family either working in the shop or getting their hair done in that same shop. For many black women, the shop is a second home where we create family ties through nurturing our hair.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw Chris Rock\u2019s 2009 documentary Good Hair, I was surprised to learn that black hair care is a multibillion-dollar business. Most of us don\u2019t think about those numbers; what\u2019s always been most important to me\u2014as I\u2019m sure it is for other folks\u2014is to find a shop that aesthetically makes me feel comfortable and at home. I want to be in a place where the business practices are exceptional and the stylist cares about my hair. But for me, the black beauty shop experience is also complicated by my identities as a lesbian, butch woman and a black/biracial person.\n\nI grew up in the black church\u2014which meant long services, skeevy deacons, wilding-out preachers\u2019 kids (PKs) and older women who absolutely ran the church, regardless of the pastor. But one of the things I remember most from my religious education is that a woman\u2019s hair is her \u201ccrowning glory,\u201d which meant you had to be very cautious about how you cut or styled your hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a kid, I had thick, curly locks that at one point extended down to my butt. People gushed over my hair, but quite frankly, I hated it. I never quite understood what to do with it, and it never held a relaxer like my friends\u2019 hair did.\n\nAs I got older, I felt even more alienated from black beauty shops because of my own relationship with race. I was adopted into a black family, so I had a clear understanding of my blackness from a very young age. But it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I began to explore the nuances of being light-skinned, black and also biracial. The push and pull of being accepted by black folk who weren\u2019t sure whether I was \u201cblack enough\u201d felt constant. And that push and pull extended to the relationship I had with my hair, and my identity as a butch woman.\n\nFor me, long hair was not part of my butch identity. It indicated a femininity that felt uncomfortable, and I needed a stylist and salon that understood and respected that. The choice to cut my hair was the most liberating feeling I\u2019d ever experienced, aside from coming out to the world and myself. But it took a long time for me to find the right person and the right shop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been in hair salons with a heavy evangelical Christian energy, where people consider Harry Potter \u201cblack magic\u201d and implore folks to beware of the churches with rainbow flags, because that\u2019s where \u201cthose people\u201d go to church.\n\nI\u2019ve been in salons where the stylist criticized my hair just for being my hair. I\u2019ve been in salons where I was simply a number in a chair. And, of course, we\u2019ve all had a salon experience where your appointment is at 9 a.m. and you don\u2019t get out of the chair until 5 p.m.\n\nAt a certain point, I knew I needed a place with a mixture of great energy, client-centered service and stylists who wanted me to love my hair as much as they loved doing hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was lucky to find Consciously Beautiful salon in St. Paul, Minn., through a friend who wears her hair natural in intricate braided styles. My relationship with stylist and owner Marla Smith is intense and intimate; she knows me almost as well as my partner of 18 years.\n\nShe was the first stylist to tell me that my hair has an actual identity (spiral corkscrew 3a), and the only stylist to identify my partner\u2019s formerly inflamed scalp as a sign of lactose intolerance and recommend that she lay off dairy for a while. Recently, she recommended that I use a little coconut oil before adding product so that my hair doesn\u2019t dry out in the harsh Minnesota winter.\n\nMarla says she decided to go into hair care because she wanted to do something she could be passionate about. And though she loves black women\u2019s hair, her clientele is diverse and spans different types of identities and people. And most importantly, her spot is a place that has great healing energy. Every month, I leave her spot relaxed, rejuvenated and filled with joy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know there are women who work in barbershops, and butch lesbians and straight women alike who get their hair cut in barbershops, but my personal politic is that I don\u2019t belong in black barbershops. There are so few places where black men are able to be vulnerable with one another that it just doesn\u2019t feel right for me to be there.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also had plenty of moments where I felt out of place in black beauty shops. I\u2019ve often felt like I was eavesdropping on black women\u2019s vulnerability in a space where femme black women have felt their safest to talk about their partners, their children, their relationships with their mothers and other women in their lives, and maybe\u2014at their most raucous\u2014whether they should be the first one to text their new love back after a night of getting their backs blown out.\n\nMy place in black beauty shops has often been fraught with deciding what part of my identity must take precedence over the other. At this point in my life, I feel lucky I no longer have to worry about that, but that\u2019s not the case for every butch woman. Understanding our place within black and primarily femme women\u2019s spaces can be complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I love the scents of black beauty salons and the energy of black women. We are divine, complex individuals\u2014even in our most hood and ratchet moments\u2014and in those spaces, we find ways to make joy and community.\n\nThankfully, I\u2019ve found a space\u2014a space where my stylist literally and figuratively weaves magic\u2014where I don\u2019t have to decide which of my identities gets to show up. For Marla, I am Stephanie: black/biracial, butch, lesbian, a client she respects, and whose success she roots for.

She was tweeting about single people having to pay more in taxes than married people with families do. OK, I will concede that I took her tweet out of context, so y\u2019all can stop tweeting me about that now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other interesting take that showed up in my mentions, however, was the idea that I was lying about being happily single. There\u2019s no way I could be happy, they told me, because all single people are secretly craving a relationship; they just lie to themselves to make themselves feel better.\n\nIt all made me wonder\u2014do people realize that \u201csingle\u201d means alone, not lonely?\n\nI am single by choice. I\u2019m not sitting over here wishing I had a man to keep me company\u2014quite the contrary. As I\u2019ve written about before, I have my share of male companions to choose from when I want that kind of company, and they are the kind I can easily kick out when I\u2019m done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I wanted a relationship, I could easily have one. To be honest, the single, nonmonogamous life just works out better for me. Not just because of the built-in variety, but because I don\u2019t have to be bothered when I don\u2019t want to be.\n\nI enjoy my solitude. I live in a Hollywood studio apartment. It\u2019s a very nice studio, and because it\u2019s older, it\u2019s a very nice size\u2014but it\u2019s just enough room in here for me. I cannot imagine having to share this space with another person. I don\u2019t even like company that much.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone at all. I just want to sit here in my panties, no bra, listen to my music and do me. I spend all day writing, and that takes a lot of brainpower. When I\u2019m ready to shut down, I\u2019m ready to shut the fuck down, and having to consider another person\u2019s needs in that would probably drive me bonkers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause keeping it real, I am busy being an amazing writer. The Root keeps me busy all day and all night. Even when I\u2019m not online, I\u2019m online looking up stuff, researching, finding new angles and thinking of things I can write about that will be interesting for our readers.\n\nI eat, sleep and breathe writing. It takes up most of my time. I also have other outside projects and endeavors that hold my interest. I am very comfortable with the company of self. It gives me time to work on my creative projects and fiction writing\u2014things I don\u2019t get to do during the day when I\u2019m writing for work.\n\nI recently attended a panel with Shonda Rhimes during which she said: \u201cI\u2019ve always been a person who lives in my imagination. I\u2019ve never been lonely. You can\u2019t be lonely if you have that kind of imagination and enjoy spending time in it. The made-up world is a way of bringing order to the real world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI related to that statement on a personal level. Most creative people are able to spend long periods of time alone without missing being around other people because the silence of self helps to birth the best ideas. I can flesh them out easier. They come to me faster.\n\nMy main focus right now is my career. I am at a high point right now, and I know that I will only grow from here, but that growth will only happen if I remain focused.\n\nI am single by choice. I am childless by choice. I don\u2019t even have a pet, because the level of responsibility seems to be a bit much for me right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can live as selfishly as I want and not have to think about it. I make decisions based on what I want to do, and I don\u2019t have to worry about how someone else is going to feel about it. If I want to pack up tomorrow and move to Paris or Barcelona, I can do that. I don\u2019t have anything weighing me down or tying me to where I am right now.\n\nThis is about personal choices, and single is the personal choice I have made for myself.\n\nSingle. Alone.

It is very hard for large and powerful institutions to undermine their own power and authority. Foucault noted that in his writings. The status-quo is quite comfortable for an institution. Is there an incentive for tribal government to present a perfect image of itself? Absolutely. Does this present an incentive to fudge the facts? It absolutely does.

Tribal-governments should work with the independent media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, it is always important to be clear, I do not believe our elected officials are inherently corrupt, nor do I believe that the creation of this publication was brought about with nefarious intent. What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

As I am one of the world\u2019s leading scholars on the subject, Wypipology: The Essential Guide to Understanding White People, will be a semiserious satire dissecting my life\u2019s work in the uncharted field of Wypipology. I have no idea who, if anyone, will read it. I just think it\u2019s a funny idea that can also unveil some truth under the guise of comedy.\n\nOn Friday, comedian, actress and world-renowned owner of an unnecessary apostrophe, Mo\u2019Nique, appeared on The Breakfast Club to confront Charlamagne tha God for naming her the \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d in January after Mo\u2019Nique called for Netflix to be placed somewhere between H&M and R. Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people. The probable lack of interest from publishers won\u2019t be based on numbers, analytics or a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them will probably be apprehensive because, like Mo\u2019Nique and Charlamagne, I have a history of publicly pissing off white people. And I, like them, wholeheartedly believe everything I say is entertaining, honest and\u2014most important\u2014correct. But it will probably cost me. I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this:\n\nHey, my loves,\n\nBecause of discrimination and bias, I\u2019m calling for us to come together as a people and stand with me in this boycott against all books and everything white, including Apple chargers, Q-Tips and granulated sugar, until a publisher presents me with a check for $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love us, for real.", "keywords": ["say", "spoiler", "donkey", "answer", "wrong", "white", "women", "netflix", "im", "monique", "charlamagne", "tha", "alert", "calling", "face", "black"], "polarity": 0.06354760006075795, "subjectivity": 0.4925099206349207},

From a high schooler once given the superlative of \u201cmost hairstyles in one year\u201d to a college co-ed visible across campus rocking a big \u2019fro before natural hair was back in fashion, she\u2019s consistently followed her own instincts when it comes to her crown and is happy to see other women doing the same:\n\nYou know, obviously we have pictures of some of our moms, or aunts or grandmothers in the \u201970s with Afros. But there was a long time when natural hair was not accepted. And so it\u2019s really great for me to see this\u2014I guess it\u2019s being called a \u201cmovement\u201d\u2014women just learning how to care for what comes out of their heads. And it\u2019s nice to have people feel like they have more options, you know? Because we can always do what we want to do, or what we feel comfortable doing\u2014whether it\u2019s a weave or it\u2019s a perm or anything else. But it\u2019s when we don\u2019t feel like we have an option that it becomes a problem; when it then becomes a societal issue, rather than a personal decision. But there\u2019s a cult mentality that\u2019s crept into the movement that I\u2019m not really supportive of. I think it has a lot to do with something that happens when people convert to a lot of things. It\u2019s always the recent converts\u2014whether it be religious dogma or philosophy or anything else\u2014that tend to be really extreme. I live in a little less of an extreme world, in my personal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, even her decision to crop her famous locks was initially met with more opposition than support. But after years of joking about taking the leap, DaCosta ultimately took the decision in stride: \u201cI was walking down the street, and as crazy as this may sound, I heard a voice\u2014maybe it was my own inner voice or higher self\u2014just say, \u2018Cut your hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter considering it late into the night, she lit some candles, sat down in front of her computer and recorded a conversation with herself, contemplating all of the things she would be releasing by cutting her hair:\n\nAnd when I tell you, after childbirth, that was the most powerful experience of my life. I cried, I hugged and kissed myself; it was amazing. And I never looked back. I always thought when people do that, the next day they wake up, like, \u201cOh my God, what did I do? I ruined my life.\u201d I didn\u2019t. I felt good about it. ... There\u2019s so much that has happened since [then] that I know would not have been possible had I been weighed down by the weight that I was carrying; the toxic relationships, other people\u2019s expectations of me, safety, hiding, not feeling beautiful without it. ... One of the things that I cut off as well was fear, and in doing so, realized how guided I was, not by love or confidence, but fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence is an issue DaCosta confesses to having struggled with in younger years. She recalls an experience early on in her professional acting career, when her father presented her with a unique challenge:\n\nHe goes, \u201cI just have one question: \u2018Where does your confidence come from?\u2019 Don\u2019t answer now\u2014just think about it\u201d ... I think that that was\u2014it was an invitation to step into the answer, to figure out what it was. And it\u2019s something that I guess is from life, when you\u2019re ready to come into yourself. And it can\u2019t be forced and it can\u2019t be faked. And you know, it\u2019s amazing having all these mirrors around me now, and people, and relationships, and just seeing how the types of people coming into my life now are different. And I\u2019m so inspired by them, and they\u2019re a reflection of the work that I\u2019ve been doing to answer that question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while DaCosta has every intention of growing her hair back\u2014healthier and with new energy and genuine confidence\u2014taking the risk has come back to reward her tenfold, especially as she becomes more aware of the impact her image has had on others:", "keywords": ["natural", "life", "know", "2015", "premiere", "growth", "yaya", "chop", "big", "2016", "chicago", "meds", "images", "talks", "dacosta", "hair", "growing", "teamnatural"], "polarity": 0.1759024490002751, "subjectivity": 0.5000853454114325},

As I do on our main site, I like to engage with the readers in the comments. As I read through what people were saying, I noticed a disturbing pattern: A great number of men were criticizing me for talking about twerking. They said that I should be focused on more important things than just shaking my ass.\n\nIf you have followed me here for even a week, you know that I write about a great many topics on The Root. The Root After Dark is just a space where I get to express a different side of myself. I get to cut loose from all the politics and negative news that can at times be draining, especially for someone who has to be constantly tuned in to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was insulted by the insinuation that I didn\u2019t have more to add to people\u2019s day. It left me wondering a few things: Why aren\u2019t black women allowed to own their sexuality? Why are the only acceptable sexual depictions of black women those that are defined by people other than black women? Why is it that, when we embrace our sexuality or\u2014as I do here each night\u2014openly express it, we are labeled whores or sluts or too sexual? Why are we immediately dismissed, as if black women were not the multidimensional, multitalented, creative and expressive embodiments of #BlackGirlMagic that we are on a daily basis?\n\nIt\u2019s not just our own people who do this to us, but it is worst when our own people do this to us, at least in my opinion. By \u201cour own people,\u201d I mean black men. Why are you so threatened by a black woman owning her sexuality? What is it about a black woman who is expressing her sexuality that makes a black man feel that he has to tear her down for it?\n\nOn the one hand, every rap video wants us dressed in the skimpiest clothing possible, shaking our asses and acting as if we\u2019re dying to lay up with MC Misogyny at the first opportunity. The other side of that game is, if I put on a skimpy outfit and pose on Instagram, I am a thot or a ho and I need to find something better to do with my time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was totally OK, even celebrated, for Elizabeth Taylor\u2014a white woman\u2014to run through a passel of husbands.

It couldn\u2019t possibly be because the president of the United States and the overlord of Russia are secretly play cousins who spend the night over each other\u2019s house and make forts out of bedsheets in the basement of the White House and read books with flashlights, could it?\n\n\n\nEver since news broke of a possible scandal involving Russia and the subsequent investigation, there have been rumors that Trump wanted Sessions to stay involved. Because Sessions straight up lied during his Senate confirmation hearing, claiming that he\u2019d never met with Russian officials, he recused himself from all Russia-related matters.\n\nNow, according to several reports, Trump was not only pissed that Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he reportedly ordered his top lawyer to try to stop Sessions from doing so.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House counsel Don McGahn, acting on orders from the president, tried but failed to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself.\n\nNBC News reports that McGahn and several White House officials called Sessions to insist that he not recuse himself, but Sessions had already made up his mind after reports surfaced that Sessions had conveniently forgotten to disclose contacts he\u2019d had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter recusing himself in March, Sessions would suddenly remember several interactions he had with Russians during Senate committee hearings in June and October.\n\nA White House lawyer for Trump, Ty Cobb, told NBC News that he had no comment on the Times report.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump administration has been vocal about Sessions\u2019 recusal. In fact, during a July press conference, Trump blatantly stated that he didn\u2019t believe that Sessions should have taken himself out of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe should not have recused himself from the Russia investigation almost immediately after he took office, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have quite simply picked somebody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne thing has been consistent since Trump took office, and that\u2019s the fact that skullduggery, lying and Russia\u2019s raiding of the White House fridge at ungodly hours is the new state of the nation.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes out of this administration; at this point, this is how I feel about every claim lobbed at the president:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times and NBC News.", "keywords": ["investigation", "recuse", "persuade", "white", "lawyer", "times", "recused", "trump", "sessions", "probe", "jeff", "report", "reports", "urged", "russia", "house"], "polarity": 0.020730027548209365, "subjectivity": 0.3796700773973502},

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings. I miss the safe space of being surrounded by women laughing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI miss my friend.", "keywords": ["natural", "shes", "surviving", "know", "women", "breakup", "miss", "woman", "lenelle", "hairdresser", "weeks", "missed", "hair", "black", "going", "ive"], "polarity": 0.06577585377585381, "subjectivity": 0.4640754208754209},

I actually have two: one I call the \u201cRatchet\u201d playlist and the other called \u201cLet\u2019s Twerk.\u201d They are my guilty pleasures.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of crossover between the two lists, but both of them have been in steady rotation over the past week. In particular, Yo Gotti\u2019s \u201cRake It Up\u201d and Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d have been the theme songs that have gotten me going every day, and that made me want to make a list of some of my current favorite twerk anthems.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order:\n\n1. \u201cRake It Up,\u201d by Yo Gotti\n\n\u201cI tell my hos rake it up. Break it down. Back it up. Fuck it up. Back it up. Rake it up.\u201d The opening lines are an instruction manual for how you should dance when this song comes on. Not to mention, he calls it a \u201cstrip club anthem.\u201d Yo Gotti is telling you to get out there, shake that ass, back it up, fuck it up and rake up the money that gets thrown at you in the process. How can you not? My ass immediately starts swinging in a circle when this comes on, and this week, as I said, it\u2019s been on a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cNo Limit,\u201d by G-Eazy, Featuring A$AP Rocky and Cardi B\n\n\u201cFuck with me and get some money.\u201d I\u2019ll admit that Cardi B\u2019s verse makes this song for me, but white boy Gerald is pretty OK on the mic as well. This is one of those bounce-your-ass-up-and-down-real-fast songs, and that\u2019s just what I do when it comes on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cMercy,\u201d by Kanye West, Featuring Big Sean, Pusha T and 2 Chainz\n\nThis is an oldie but a goodie. It\u2019s still a damn goodie. My favorite thing to do is switch the direction of my waist wine every time Big Sean says, \u201cSwerve.\u201d I performed a dance for one of my man friends to this song, and he loved the \u201cswerve\u201d move. It worked out that night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d by Cardi B\n\nI changed the hook on this to say, \u201cI don\u2019t freelance no more, I make money moves,\u201d and it applies. I love this song because Cardi is talking about her come-up over the last year, and I relate. My come up as a writer over the last year has been similar, and while I am eternally grateful for those who helped me get here\u2014\u201cWhat bitch working hard as me?\u201d I feel it in my soul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cMoney Money Money,\u201d by Red Cafe\n\nAnother oldie but goodie. I like this song because you have to really have the skills to make your ass clap to this, and I do. This song is still amazing; don\u2019t @ me. It will always be on my list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cMotorSport,\u201d by Migos, Featuring Cardi B and Nicki Minaj\n\n\u201cYou heard she gon\u2019 do what to who? That\u2019s not a reliable source, so tell me have you seen her, let me wrap my weave up, I\u2019m the trap Selena, dame mas gasolina!\u201d Obviously Cardi is my favorite part of this song, too. Like, I legit turn it off when Nicki comes on and skip to the next song on my list. Cardi really said \u201cRide the dick like a BMX,\u201d though, and I\u2019m here for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cMy Chick Bad Remix,\u201d by Ludacris, Featuring Diamond, Eve, Trina\n\nThis song aged well. Especially Eve\u2019s verse, since she married a damn billionaire. I love this song because the women are unabashedly loving themselves, and I feel powered up when I rap and dance along to this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cScarred,\u201d by Uncle Luke, Featuring Trick Daddy\n\nThis is an OG twerk song. Luke started the movement; he fathered all these others. My knees are bad now from dropping it low to this song so much in the \u201990s. Get into it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cLove Me for Free,\u201d by Akinyele\n\nOK, so this may not necessarily be a twerk anthem. It\u2019s more of a two-step song, but two-stepping and rapping along to these raunchy-ass lyrics is the real winner. I couldn\u2019t find a version with the real lyrics, \u201cFuck me for free,\u201d but this will do, pig. This will do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cNo Hands,\u201d by Waka Flocka Flame, Featuring Wale, Roscoe Dash\n\nRaise your hand if you can drop it to the floor and bounce it, with no hands. This song will forever exist on both of my lists, most especially because of Wale\u2019s verse. I don\u2019t care about the other two dudes on the song, but when it gets to Wale\u2019s part, I lose my shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there you have it. A list of some of my current twerk anthems. I volunteered to send my editor, The Root Managing Editor Genetta Adams, a video demonstrating what \u201cthrow that ass in a circle\u201d means, but she declined.\n\nWhat do you like to throw your ass in a circle to?

Seriously, why is King Keebler, the attorney general of the United States, so hell-bent on taking the good herb away from the people?\n\n\n\nWhile the president is out here having a nuclear-button-measuring contest with the equally unstable (yet starting to look more sane than Donald Trump) supreme leader of North Korea, on Thursday, Sessions decided that he\u2019s going to continue the Trump mandate of undoing President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy by rescinding the policy of not interfering with marijuana-friendly state laws, CNN reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news site notes that many states have decriminalized or legalized weed use, but because the drug is still illegal under federal laws, and an elf face whose middle name is Beauregard\u2014which had to be impossible as a child, even a child who attended Klan Kids Kindergarten\u2014is insistent on hating us all.\n\nAccording to CNN, the Obama administration took a more hands-off approach to marijuana in states where the harmless happiness had been legalized. As long as the weed smoker wasn\u2019t attached to a cartel or distributing the drug to minors, police could basically behave like security at a Cypress Hill concert.\n\nNo one knows how Sessions plans to proceed because, like most things with this Azealia Banks-ass administration, rescinding Obama policy seems to be the only focus. It\u2019s unclear whether states where pot is legal will revert to the old policies regarding federal enforcement or if King Keebler will enact a new policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the belief is that Sessions plans to use federal laws to crack down on legal-weed states because he\u2019s an asshole who hasn\u2019t deal with his deep-seeded weed issues.

As did the death of luminaries such as Dick Gregory and Maurice White. But for all their contributions in moving black culture forward, their statuses as legends were solidified prior to their passing. My fear is that Reggie Oss\u00e9, better known as Combat Jack, who at 48 years young succumbed to colon cancer months after announcing his diagnosis, was denied a similar fate.\n\nThe first time I met Combat Jack was in Anaheim, Calif., last October at Now Hear This, an annual festival in which popular podcasters meet their adoring fans and perform their shows live. Riding off the unexpected success of my own podcast, The Extraordinary Negroes, which debuted a few months prior, my black ass was there for one reason and one reason only: to convince him that my show belonged on his Loud Speakers Network.\n\nHome to Kid Fury and Crissle\u2019s inimitable wit, Charlamagne tha Contrarian\u2019s polarizing opinions, Taxstone\u2019s authenticity and Angela Rye\u2019s raised fist, the roster on the Loud Speakers Network (which Combat Jack co-owned) is rivaled only by the Golden State Warriors\u2014just knocking down 30-foot jumpers and dunking on niggas for no reason, scoreboard and feelings be damned.\n\nWith my VIP pass in tow, I crept into some lounge I had no business being in and introduced myself to the man who inspired me to launch my own show, Combat Jack. Since I\u2019m an avid listener of The Combat Jack Show, he was amazed by how effortlessly I could recall minute details. He blistered at N.O.R.E.\u2019s penchant for continually hounding him about a deal he botched as a young lawyer, schooled me on interviewing techniques, gushed over his favorite podcasting equipment and shared a sneak preview of his next endeavor, Mogul, which was released earlier this year to universal acclaim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazed that I was able to get this kind of one-on-one time with him, I told him how much of a profound impact he had on me and how he was directly responsible for my own show even existing. Before I knew it, nearly two hours had passed. And as much as I appreciated chopping it up on some barbershop shit, it was time to shoot my shot.\n\nI prattled off about how we tackle difficult subjects within our community but infuse humor in order to make them more digestible. How our show was exactly what his network was missing and how we fit a need. He was impressed at our list of guests. \u201cY\u2019all did that yourself?\u201d Yup.\n\nBut before I could stunt on Instagram and commemorate our new partnership with obnoxious selfies and imaginary bottles of Champagne, I heard three fateful words: \u201cHolla at Matt.\u201d Matt, of course, being the innocuous white guy who, thanks to no formal introduction courtesy of Combat Jack, had no idea I had just spent the last two hours talking to his boss. Matt would also be the one to kill my dreams of throwing on that Loud Speakers jersey by referring me to the contact form on their website. \u201cSubmit your show on there and we\u2019ll check it out.\u201d Ouch. Thanks, Matt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I was devastated, but in hindsight, I realized I wasn\u2019t heavy enough in the podcast game to just waltz up to Combat Jack and expect him to snatch up my show. Dejected, I remember walking back to my car afterward promising myself that the next time I saw him, he would know who the hell I was.\n\nOver the next nine months, I proceeded to bust my ass building momentum for my podcast. Our social media following skyrocketed to over 80,000 followers; we joined forces with the big homies Panama Jackson and Damon Young for a watch party in Washington, D.C., for BET\u2019s The New Edition Story; got shoutouts in numerous publications, including Bitch Media and the New York Times; got invited to SXSW to perform a live episode of our show; announced a partnership with streaming media juggernaut TuneIn; and got nominated for Best Society and Culture Podcast in the People\u2019s Choice Podcast Awards. A bunch of other accolades and opportunities fell into our laps as a direct result of our success. So when I heard that Combat Jack was returning to Los Angeles for BET Weekend in June to do another live show, I was ready this time.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before his show started, I ran into him inside the venue. Much to my surprise, he rolled up on me. \u201cYo, it\u2019s Jay, right?\u201d Wait, what? He must have me confused with somebody else. I started to remind him of how we met at Now Hear This, but he shut me down quick: \u201cYo, I wanna come on your show. I leave on Monday. Let\u2019s make it happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoa.\n\nKnowing how much he prided himself on preparing for his interviews (a trait I inherited from him) and realizing that him coming on to my show was essentially my audition for the Loud Speakers Network, I knew rushing to record that weekend was a terrible idea. Much to even my own surprise, I declined. Instead, I offered to bring him on in a few weeks. To which he replied, \u201cBet. No bullshit. I wanna come on. Y\u2019all moving out here.\u201d He snatched my phone out of my hand, plugged his number in, asked someone to get a picture of us, dapped me up, then dissolved into the crowd. Thankfully, Matt was nowhere to be found this time.\n\nAfter locking in his interview, I was so amped I took my ass straight home after his show and stayed up until 3 a.m. researching him on the internet. Over the course of the next few weeks, I called or texted various people who had personal relationships with him and dragged tidbits of information out of them to craft questions around. After an absurd amount of research and preparation, I was 100 percent confident I would deliver his best interview ever. But sadly, fate had other plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough we texted back and forth trying to lock in a date, his schedule was bananas. First it was Vegas, then it was family. Soon it was becoming painfully obvious that the opportunity to interview the man who single-handedly changed my life and so many others was diminishing. But our failure to lock in his interview doesn\u2019t upset me at all. It\u2019s the fact that I never had the opportunity to thank him.\n\nSimply put, in launching the Loud Speakers Network, Combat Jack provided so many of us with a voice. In a world consumed with diluting, disparaging and disposing of any semblance of blackness, he created a platform for us to be our unapologetic selves. And while he wasn\u2019t the first black podcaster, he was easily the most influential. You can literally pinpoint the trajectory of podcasting before and after the birth of the Loud Speakers Network.\n\nIn fact, if you eliminate his contributions and influence, many of your favorite comedians, entertainers and media personalities wouldn\u2019t be where they are today. That\u2019s a fact. The argument can even be made that SoundCloud is only being kept afloat because podcasters funnel so much money into it. Though SoundCloud is widely maligned in podcasting circles, an overwhelming majority of podcasters of color host their own shows on the platform anyway in order to emulate Loud Speakers Network\u2019s formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for creatives such as myself, he provided us with far more than just a voice. He gave us our calling. After moving to Los Angeles in 2014 to jump-start my own writing career, I quickly realized that instead of pounding the pavement to work my way up the food chain, the fastest way to reel in the writing opportunities I wanted was to leverage my personality into popularity.\n\nAs such, podcasting has allowed me to reach millions of people I otherwise never would. It\u2019s allowed me to travel the country and generate awareness around important issues such as mental health in the black community, social justice and the pervasiveness of toxic masculinity. It\u2019s allowed me to change lives, speak in schools and on panels, and celebrate the agency and accomplishments of people of color. Podcasting has provided me with invaluable relationships and has opened countless doors that would otherwise have remained closed. In short, podcasting has given me\u2014and countless others\u2014purpose.\n\nAnd that\u2019s solely because of Combat Jack.\n\nHis death teaches us not only that one man has the power to move mountains but also why it\u2019s important that we champion our heroes while they\u2019re still here to move them.

Is that still a thing?\n\nTo be clear, most times when this was and is talked about, it\u2019s in reference to women and never men. No one ever looks down on the man who \u201cgets some\u201d on the first date, but the woman who \u201cgives it up\u201d on the first date is considered \u201ceasy\u201d or a \u201cho\u201d for doing what she wants with her body.\n\nSuch arguments are steeped in religion and patriarchy. A woman\u2019s body is considered her greatest virtue, and giving it to anyone but her husband would be the worst thing she could ever do. In fact, women who assume agency over their own bodies are frowned upon for just about anything; you can see this evidenced whenever the infamous \u201cbody count\u201d discussion comes up on Twitter.\n\nThere are those who believe that a woman who has sex with a man on the first date will never be taken seriously by him. Never mind that they are two consenting adults who participated with each other in the same activity. She is the one who is looked down upon. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nA lot of people have deeply religious backgrounds, and the church has given people a lot of unnecessary hangups where sex is concerned. You can\u2019t touch yourself and learn your own body, and you damn sure can\u2019t let anyone else touch it and learn it. Sexual repression and abstinence are the gospel, and in a lot of cases, that can lead to unhealthy sexual ideation and behaviors later in life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am of the belief that it\u2019s up to the two people involved whether or not they want to bump uglies on the first date, but I am a woman who has participated in a one-night stand or two, and I see nothing wrong with it as long as you practice safe sex.\n\nWhat happens when you are out for the first time and the vibe is incredibly strong? What happens when both of you are feeling that attraction that pulls your pelvises together like magnets?\n\nAny man who will have sex with you on the first date, then claim not to respect you after the fact, is a hypocrite. Sir, you did it, too. What makes you above reproach, if we are judging at all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual exploration is a big part of being an adult. Consenting adults should be allowed to do whatever they want with each other as long as they do so willingly and safely.\n\nSex on the first date can be an icebreaker. You\u2019ve gotten some of the awkwardness out of the way. You have determined whether or not you are sexually compatible. You can move on to the freak shit on the next date.\n\nOr not. Either way, it\u2019s completely up to you. Other people\u2019s opinions on it should not ever be a consideration in what you, as an adult, choose to do with your body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was curious about this topic, though, so I posted a poll on Twitter to see what my followers and their friends thought about it.\n\nOf the 546 people who took the time to answer the survey, 83 percent said that they believed sex on the first date was fine. A small group, 17 percent, believed that people should wait before having sex.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked people to expand on their answers if they were willing to be quoted for this column.\n\nOne gentleman said that he believed sex on the first date was a bad idea if you were looking to get into a relationship. I asked him why, and another person responded and said because sex clouds your judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get that people can be dickmatized, but if that is your problem, you probably have some other shit to work out besides whether or not you should have sex on the first date.\n\nNot that I am above or talking down on people who have been or are currently dickmatized, because bitch, I know the struggle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a gentleman who said he\u2019s never done it but that he is all for it because he wants a preview of things to come.\n\nThere were more than a few married women who responded to my query and said that not only had they had sex on the first date, but they eventually married the man with whom they had the first-date sex, which dispels the assumption that men won\u2019t see value in a woman who lies down with them on the first date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were plenty of people who believed you should do what you want to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line here is simple\u2014do what feels right for you. In the end, you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation for your actions or your choices. They are personal.\n\nThe idea that sex on the first date will preclude anyone, most especially a woman, from finding long-term loving relationships is dumb and needs to go away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is at times like these that I remember a motto I repeat over and over again on Twitter:\n\nMind your own pussy.", "keywords": ["man", "believed", "women", "body", "way", "1st", "date", "woman", "yes", "sex", "lot", "considered"], "polarity": 0.10829314848302188, "subjectivity": 0.5099809121961022},

The soft-scented cure for all things ashy popped on the scene, and black girls immediately fell in love with its line of hair-care products that let us love on our natural hair at an affordable price. It was easily accessible. It had different product lines containing different essential oils. Black girls talked it up and helped it grow into an empire.\n\nAnd how did it repay black girls?\n\nBy making a commercial about how hard it is to be accepted with your natural hair and centering white women in that narrative.\n\nAs if.\n\nSheaMoisture got canceled faster than a show starring Taye Diggs.\n\nYou took a huge L, SheaMoisture. I hope those white women were worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Dove and SheaMoisture are now under the same corporate umbrella. Dove caught the ire of black women and social media in general a few months ago when it dropped an ad on its Facebook page that featured a darker-skinned black woman turning into a white woman\u2014literally.\n\nThe black woman was wearing a T-shirt that matched her skin color. She lifts the shirt over her head to reveal a white woman in a cream-colored shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ad hit a sore spot for black people. For years, soap companies advertised their products as being able to wash the black off of people. No one could understand what Dove\u2019s motives were for creating such an ad.\n\nThe company tried to explain, but the damage had already been done.\n\nShame on you, Dove. Next time, consult actual people of color before trying to make an ad that is supposed to appeal to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nRemember when we heard Nicki on Roman\u2019s Revenge and Kanye\u2019s Monster and thought she was going to be everything we wanted to represent the ladies in hip-hop? Those sure were the days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToo bad she came into 2017 and started the year off immediately taking an L when Remy Ma slaughtered her with ShETHER. That was seemingly the harbinger of doom for Nicki, who continued on the path of WTF? with a detour onto that questionable Paper magazine cover and culminating in her ultimately being bested at her own game by the one and only Cardi B.\n\nRumor has it that when both women appeared on the Migos hit Motorsport, Nicki changed her verse after she heard Cardi\u2019s.

How do you do absolutely nothing to foster better relationships between that man in the Oval Office and black people in America\u2014especially when your job description says that is what you are supposed to do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut instead of doing that, Omarosa turned the White House into a photoshoot location for her wedding, showed her ass at the NABJ convention, hosted her wedding at a Trump hotel, got on national TV and proclaimed that Trump is not a racist, he\u2019s just racial\u2014and, after all that ass-kissing and tap dancing, still got fired from her job as token White House darkie.

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger.

She had a sexual encounter with a man who knew absolutely nothing about foreplay. He kissed her one or two times, slid into her without even making sure she was ready, and finished his little \u201cact\u201d all within two minutes. It was all bad.\n\nIt led us to discussing what do men think constitutes foreplay and how if only they realized foreplay is the key to a good sexual experience for everyone, we might not hold it against them so much when they fall short of our expectations in other areas.\n\nOK, maybe we would still hold it against them, but we would give them lots of points for their effort during the preamble. So that got me to thinking about all the things lots of men don\u2019t know, but could probably stand to learn, about foreplay.\n\nThis is a primer, so print it out and tape it to your mirror or your refrigerator or someplace you can see it daily and commit it to memory, fellas. This one is for you.\n\n1. Please realize that foreplay is about more than getting her \u201cwet\u201d so you can slide in.\n\nIt\u2019s about creating a level of intimacy, even with partners you have been with before. It\u2019s about setting up the perfect sexual alley-oop. It\u2019s about the buildup before the final act. Turn her up. Make her want to give herself to you. Make her want to get freaky with you. Make her want to whip out all the tricks she\u2019s been holding back from all the other dudes she\u2019s ever been with. Make her want to bless you with her body. Give her a reason to want you badly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. It\u2019s more than just kissing her and fondling her breasts.\n\nIf she is anything like me, she may not have that much sensitivity in her breasts anyway. All my sensitivity is in my nipples and along the sides of my breasts, so if you spend all your time kissing me across the tops of them, I\u2019m going to pull my phone out and check Twitter until you\u2019re done. This is not a joke.\n\n3. Foreplay is the perfect opportunity to learn about and explore your partner\u2019s body.\n\nYou can help her find \u201cthat spot\u201d she didn\u2019t even know she had. I never knew I was supersensitive on my shoulders until an old partner kissed and bit me on them. Now? That is my biggest turn-on, and I tell everyone I\u2019m with, because I want them to use that to their advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKiss all her 2,000 parts. Don\u2019t be afraid to try something new. Don\u2019t be afraid to try something that worked on someone else. She\u2019ll let you know through her body\u2019s responses and audibly whether or not something is working. Find that spot that makes her yell out in ecstasy. It\u2019s what you are here for, right?\n\n4. Foreplay is the easiest way to give a woman multiple orgasms if you are unable to do so with your penis.\n\nThere are so many ways to turn a woman on. Our bodies are treasure maps just waiting to be explored and discovered. Buried in lots of little unknown spots are the keys to even the elusive squirting orgasm, but you have to be more Lewis and Clark than Columbus about your game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are willing to travel the distance, the rewards will be great. If, however, you just want to destroy and plunder, you aren\u2019t going to get very far and probably won\u2019t be asked back. In fact, your reputation may be massacred when she discusses you with her girlfriends.\n\nYes, fellas, we have those conversations just like y\u2019all do. If you have left a woman unsatisfied, I guarantee at least five of her best girlfriends know about it, and they try to hold in their laughter whenever you are around.\n\nThat \u201cOh, this is Jerome\u201d has more to do with what we\u2019ve heard about you sexually and less to do with how good a guy she thinks you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Foreplay has the potential to be more pleasurable and sensual than the actual intercourse itself.\n\nThis is especially true for those of you who already know your own shortcomings. Don\u2019t play her, and for the love of Venus, don\u2019t play yourself, either.\n\nDon\u2019t just stop at cunnilingus\u2014take your time with her body. Kiss her everywhere. Put your tongue everywhere. Put your fingers everywhere. Whisper to her. Look her in her eyes as you touch her. Ask her if she likes it. Ask her if she wants it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are so many erogenous zones on a woman\u2019s body. Make it a game to find five new ones every time you are with her. Dedicate yourself to making her moan before you are inside her.\n\nAny man can stroke a woman with his dick; it takes a skilled one to bring her to orgasm.\n\nIf you can make her orgasm without using your penis?

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["hook", "law", "violent", "dishonest", "continues", "crime", "america", "increase", "sessions", "enforcement", "safe", "tour", "rates", "nearly", "drug", "watch"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

Other times, we are already waist-deep in emotions and feelings before we realize that the dude has no intentions toward us, accepts no accountability for his actions and is really just wasting our time.\n\n\n\nLet me be an example for you. I\u2019ve discussed my history with the \u201cLawrence type\u201d before, but I am going to go into a bit more detail today because I think it\u2019s needed. Momo went through that so you wouldn\u2019t have to. Heed my lessons, sisters.\n\nA gentleman approached me earlier this year and suggested that we collaborate on a creative project. I agreed, and in the course of our working on the project, private messages were exchanged. We also exchanged phone numbers, and the messaging branched out to texting.\n\nI was totally consumed by someone else at that point, so I considered our exchanges to be minor flirting at best. The frequency and intensity of the messages grew over the summer, however, and we started talking on the phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cgetting to know each other\u201d phase was sweet. He was charming, funny and smart. I found myself more and more attracted to him, and it appeared that the feeling was mutual.\n\nWhen I initially brought up taking things further, he brushed it off and said that he had some other things going on. I was confused, but he told me that he didn\u2019t object to the idea, he just wanted to clear out the other stuff first, so I acquiesced. We continued the flirtation. We continued talking every day. It got to the point where, if we didn\u2019t talk for even one day, things seemed weird\u2014to both of us.\n\nMore and more, though, I noticed that he bristled whenever I brought up the subject of taking things further again. So one day I asked him flat out, \u201cWhat are your intentions with me?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought about it.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was. This man whom I had spent hours each day for months talking with admitted that he was basically wasting my time. He didn\u2019t have any intentions with me. He just enjoyed the conversations and the attention.\n\nI was pissed\u2014both at him and at myself for ignoring the signs that were there all along. I was a fool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA man who knows what he wants from you is going to make that clear up front. He\u2019s going to tell you. If he\u2019s serious about it, he\u2019s going to tell you repeatedly. He\u2019s not going to beat around the bush or dodge your questions about it. He will have the answers because the thing that he wants is within his grasp. He only needs you to agree with and go along with it.\n\nHe\u2019s not going to play games with accountability, and in the earlier example, saying that he had no intentions is the way that man attempted to avoid accountability.\n\nAs long as he can pretend that he is \u201cjust friends\u201d and not looking for anything more, he thinks that is a way for him not to be responsible for how he makes you feel\u2014good, bad or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled, ladies. \u201cFriends\u201d is just a word they use to keep their toe in your pool. It\u2019s the way they are able to keep themselves in your orbit. Calling himself a friend makes it easy for him to have access to you without all the responsibility that comes with calling you his woman or girlfriend. It\u2019s the easy button. He can pretty much do what he wants, and whenever you voice an objection, he will throw that \u201cjust friends\u201d \u201cGet out of jail free\u201d card up in your face. It\u2019s bullshit.\n\nA real friend wouldn\u2019t treat you like that. If he were really your friend, and you told him that there was a man doing the things to you that he himself is doing, would he think that was OK? Ask him that. Chances are he won\u2019t answer or he will deflect instead, because he knows the truth: He\u2019s full of shit.\n\nSo what do we do, and how do we avoid letting this happen over and over again?\n\nFor me, I had to recognize that once I allowed it to happen, it became the norm. There was no need for him to change his behavior as long as I provided him an in for his performative brand of friendship. The moment I allowed myself to be a lily pad (we\u2019ll discuss this at length some other time) or a pleasant distraction or whatever it was he saw me as, that was the only thing he was going to see me as, no matter what. He didn\u2019t have to change because I wasn\u2019t changing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that you have to realize you are worth more than what you are getting so that things can and do change. First it was my initial irritation with the situation that made me create some space between us. Then it was the moment another man entered my life (HDT, for those who follow me on Twitter. We\u2019ll talk about him soon, too) who had real intentions and took real action to win me over that both I and Performative Friend Boy realized that things had changed. Flush the fuckboy behavior away and let some real light enter your life.\n\nBecause there won\u2019t be space for the real light to enter your life as long as you are allowing fuckboy behavior to have a stage on which to perform. It may sound clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true: You are blocking your blessings that way.\n\nNo matter how much it hurts\u2014and believe me, I know how much it can hurt when you are invested in someone\u2014in the end, letting go will be much easier than carrying on with someone who doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart. You deserve more than someone who is only looking out for himself and his selfish needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took me realizing that Performative Friend Boy lacked emotional intelligence and emotional maturity to truly put the nail in that coffin. I don\u2019t look at him the same, and I never will. He wasted my time. I wasted my time.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that you or I won\u2019t come across one of these dudes ever again. The growth comes in recognizing the signs and stopping the bleeding before it turns into a hemorrhage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe may not always get it right, but the more we realize our own personal value, the more likely we will be not to waste it on the wrong people.", "keywords": ["didnt", "man", "wont", "real", "playing", "things", "hes", "emotions", "day", "intentions", "friend", "wasting", "going"], "polarity": 0.16290322580645164, "subjectivity": 0.47530721966205824},

Yet when members of the Justice Department appeared before the House Judiciary Committee, no one seemed to be able to explain exactly what the document is or how or why it was created.\n\nHere\u2019s how columnist Clarence Page described the document for the Chicago Tribune:\n\nPrepared by the FBI\u2019s Domestic Terrorism Analysis Unit in August and first reported last month by Foreign Policy\u2019s website, the report singles out a \u201cBlack Identity Extremist\u201d movement, or \u201cBIE,\u201d as a violent threat motivated by \u201cperceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\u201d And who is this movement? The report describes a half-dozen highly publicized killings of police officers by black perpetrators in various cities and links them under the \u201cBIE\u201d label based on no other apparent connection but their reported hatred for police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem with the report is everything. The FBI, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about it; nor does the Department of Justice. Not only does no one seem to be able to explain who \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d are, but they have been considered and noted as domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence,\u201d reads the report, marked for official use only and obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\u201cThe FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement,\u201d the report states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the only person who seems to be holding top brass accountable is Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who left Attorney General Jeff Sessions befuddled and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speechless.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary Committee hearing in November, Bass pressed Sessions to explain the report. He couldn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t read it, but, he added, that he was familiar with the \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d Here\u2019s how The Root staff writer Monique Judge recounted that encounter:\n\n\u201cOK, so you haven\u2019t necessarily read the report, but you are familiar with the term \u2018black identity extremists\u2019?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cWell, I think so, yes,\u201d Sessions said. [LOL. \u201cI think so.\u201d] \u201cSo can you tell me what that term means to you?\u201d Bass asked. \u201cDo you believe there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \u2018black identity extremists,\u2019 and what does that movement do?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019d be interested to see the conclusions of that report,\u201d Sessions said, attempting to deflect, \u201cbut I\u2019m aware that there are groups that have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity, and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists ... so\u2014\u201d Bass cut him off. \u201cAre you aware of white organizations that do this as well? Given that white supremacy is a well-documented, well-researched movement, such as the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, etc.\u2014are they white identity extremists?\u201d she asked. Sessions feigned confusion, as if he did not understand what was a very clear and direct question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary Committe hearing with Rosenstein, Bass again wanted answers about documents coming from the FBI that appear to indirectly label the Black Lives Matter movement as a terrorist organization that threatens police. She also noted that members of the Black Lives Matter movement have been questioned by the FBI, yet no one seems to know anything about the document or how the conclusions in said document were made.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done.

I couldn\u2019t let him go. I couldn\u2019t get him out of my system. I kept letting him back in.\n\n\n\nWe were just kids when it started. He became infatuated with me after we graduated from high school, and it grew from there.\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t give him the time of day. He was too nerdy for me. Too soft-spoken. Not gangster enough. But he treated me like a queen and put me on a high pedestal, and I eventually gave in to him. And then I fell in love.\n\nWe discovered our sex together. He put me in charge of my orgasms. We loved each other like our lives depended on it. It was deep. It was hard. It was young. And at the time, it meant everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe eventually broke up, but we never broke away from each other. Over the course of nearly 20 years, we had the sort of push-and-pull relationship that Lauryn describes in her song. I knew he wasn\u2019t good for me, but I didn\u2019t want anyone else. He wanted to be with other people, but he couldn\u2019t cure himself of me.\n\nIs this just a silly game\n\nThat forces you to act this way?\n\nForces you to scream my name\n\nThen pretend that you can\u2019t stay\n\nTell me who I have to be\n\nTo get some reciprocity\n\nSee, no one loves you more than me\n\nAnd no one ever will.\n\nWe went back and forth for years. We hooked up repeatedly, only to later regret it. It was too emotional. Too raw. Too sexual. Too intoxicating. Too addicting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were times when we sought each other out\u2014ran to each other, even, only to push each other way with painful words and deliberately hurtful actions. It was a game we both played with each other, one that lasted way longer than it should have.\n\nI knew all along that the relationship was toxic. I knew that no matter how many times I allowed him back into my life and back into my bed, things were not going to change. It was always going to be a thing where I screamed his name in ecstasy and later cursed it in pain.\n\nHe told me once that he felt like I had a power over him\u2014one that wouldn\u2019t let him be rid of me. He said I had a control over him that no one else did. That no matter what, he knew he would always come back, even briefly, because our connection was that strong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how I think we grow\n\nYou always seem to let me know\n\nIt ain\u2019t workin\u2019 ...\n\nAnd when I try to walk away\n\nYou\u2019d hurt yourself to make me stay\n\nThis is crazy \u2026\n\nI took those words in and believed it meant that ultimately we would be together. Even as I found nonmonogamy and discovered a different lifestyle for myself, somewhere in the back of my mind, I had decided that if he ever changed his mind, I would be with him and only him ... forever.\n\n\n\nIt never worked out like that.\n\nIn the end, after hurting each other too many times for far too long, we parted ways for the last time and never looked back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t even think of him in the same way anymore. There\u2019s no hate. We are Facebook friends and follow each other on Twitter and Instagram, but our interactions are few and far between, and never do we wistfully reach out to each other in misguided moments of nostalgia.\n\nI\u2019m just glad that I don\u2019t let him back in.\n\nSo why do we let them back in?\n\nI keep letting you back in\n\nHow can I explain myself?\n\nAs painful as this thing has been\n\nI just can\u2019t be with no one else\n\nSee I know what we\u2019ve got to do\n\nYou let go, and I\u2019ll let go too\n\n\u2019Cause no one\u2019s hurt me more than you\n\nAnd no one ever will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a big reason is that it\u2019s hard to let go. When you have been down with someone for so long, as I was with Young Love (let\u2019s just call him that to save confusion), it\u2019s hard to let go of the them you fell in love with, even if that person is no longer there. You remember what was, and you hold on to what could be.\n\n\n\nThey become a habit, and old habits die hard. As much as we want to wean ourselves off of them, the slightest hint of them can send us spiraling back into what we already know is a bad situation.\n\nWe do it because we are hopeful. We want this time to be different. They exhibit the smallest amount of change, and we take that as a sign that they are committed to being better. We repeat the cycle of hoping for the best but bracing for the worst\u2014because ultimately, we know that it is going to end the same way it did before, and probably hurt just as much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do we let go and stop letting them back in? I really don\u2019t have the answer for that. I still go through this myself. I recently let someone back in and immediately regretted it. I\u2019m pushing them right back out, and that is a sign to me that there\u2019s growth there. I\u2019m getting better at it.\n\nAt some point you just get tired of the cycle, and that is an evolution you can\u2019t force or perform on anyone\u2019s timetable but your own.\n\nEach time you go through it, you learn something different\u2014but so do they, so beware. They\u2019ll elevate their game when they recognize what you won\u2019t tolerate any longer, but they will only do just enough to weasel their way back in. As your sense of self-awareness grows, so will your ability to counter their actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will have all kinds of slick moves and slick talk for you. You will fall for some of those antics again, and some of them you will recognize for what they are and push past them.\n\nNo matter how I think we grow\n\nYou always seem to let me know\n\nIt ain\u2019t workin\u2019 ...\n\nAnd when I try to walk away\n\nYou hurt yourself to make me stay\n\nThis is crazy \u2026\n\nThe greatest piece of advice I can offer is to take time for yourself and figure out what you want. Be clear about what it is that you want. Be sure about it. Then measure him up against what it is you say you want.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t measure him up against what he was previously, because with even the smallest amount of effort, he will be able to look better to you than he did before. Using what you want is the better measure, because you can easily check off where he doesn\u2019t make the mark.\n\nTry not to be hard on yourself. We all take different amounts of time to get over things\u2014and again, no one can dictate your timetable but you. You will know when you have had enough, and when you have, you will be better able to move on.\n\nCare for me, care for me\n\nI know you care for me\n\nThere for me, there for me\n\nSaid you\u2019d be there for me\n\nCry for me, cry for me\n\nYou said you\u2019d die for me\n\nGive to me, give to me\n\nWhy won\u2019t you live for me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCare enough for yourself to want more, though, and be self-aware enough to give yourself that.\n\n\n\nEven if it\u2019s just a little bit at a time.", "keywords": ["unable", "hurt", "exes", "know", "times", "matter", "way", "letting", "think", "let", "knew", "problematic", "hard", "better"], "polarity": 0.06572338635863226, "subjectivity": 0.4609604375587982},

I didn\u2019t smoke weed in front of her. What I actually did was whip out a joint and tell her I was going to smoke it in her bathroom, where she regularly smokes her cigarettes to keep her apartment from smelling like tobacco. So I was actually trying to be respectful by hotboxing her bathroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she saw the joint, she made that face mothers make right before they say, \u201cWhat you not gon\u2019 do \u2026 \u201d But my mother didn\u2019t say anything. She just shook her head and walked away.\n\n\n\nNow, my mom kinda suspected that I was a weed smoker. But when California finally legalized recreational marijuana\u2014or adult use of marijuana, which some pro-cannabis activists prefer because, honestly, no one ever says \u201crecreational alcohol\u201d or \u201crecreational cigarettes\u201d about the two legal vices enjoyed and consumed by grown-ass people\u2014I thought it was time to clear the air, so to speak, and make it plain that I do enjoy legal weed, just as she enjoys her legal cigarettes.\n\nI mention this story because it appears that Attorney General Jeff Sessions might be back on that bullshit about cracking down on marijuana. On Friday he met with a group of anti-legalization activists behind closed doors, and I\u2019m pretty sure they weren\u2019t swapping Christmas-cookie recipes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as we know, Sessions has never met with pro-pot activists during his first year in office. And last week, a video emerged showing Sessions in full asshole mode mocking a Department of Justice intern about her stance on marijuana while making a few misleading statements of his own (more on that later).\n\nSessions, who\u2019s been pretty wishy-washy about marijuana policy as attorney general, has famously said, \u201cGood people don\u2019t smoke marijuana.\u201d But that statement defies logic when you consider that 29 states have legalized medical marijuana and seven states plus Washington, D.C., have co-signed recreational weed. Maybe he doesn\u2019t know any good people, which isn\u2019t hard to believe, to be honest.\n\nBut Sessions aside, there is still a pretty strong social stigma around people who use weed. The image of the stoner stuck on a couch eating Cheetos is probably the first thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of a weed smoker, which is why it\u2019s time for the good, weed-smoking people of America to let it be known that they happily puff-puff-pass while still managing to contribute to society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvidence has shown that weed is less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco, yet the federal government classifies it as a Schedule I drug, the highest classification, which puts marijuana on par with heroin. Our government thinks weed is more dangerous than Schedule II drugs cocaine and crystal meth, which is fucking bananas.\n\nSessions once even claimed that marijuana was \u201conly less awful than heroin,\u201d which is utter horseshit when you consider that the number of overdoses from opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers skyrocketed in 2016. (Sessions just recently conceded that weed isn\u2019t as bad as heroin. Gee, thanks, little buddy!)\n\nYou know how many people have died from a marijuana overdose in the history of marijuana? Zero.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study even suggested that opiate-related deaths went down after Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, and some experts believe that cannabis could actually help ease the abuse of opioids, which account for 63 percent of all drug-related deaths.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of opioids, in that video with the intern, Sessions claimed that last year was the first time that drugs rather than alcohol caused more fatal car accidents. He\u2019s basically correct on that point (the year was actually 2015), except the issue is more nuanced than that.\n\nSince police still don\u2019t have a reliable DUI test for weed (officers are mainly just judging behavior to determine if a driver is high), it\u2019s difficult to know what role, if any, weed may have played in an accident, especially since marijuana stays in your system awhile after actual use. But what Sessions failed to mention is that there\u2019s also been a huge spike in prescription-opioid-related fatal car crashes (however, the same rule about no reliable DUI test also applies to opioids).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions also asked that intern to check with the American Medical Association about the dangers of marijuana. Again, while Sessions is right that the AMA says marijuana is a dangerous drug and recreational weed should not be legalized, he didn\u2019t mention that the organization has also called for more research on both the positive and negative effects of cannabis. Because legalization is moving way faster than research, rescheduling the drug to open up scientific study makes even more sense from a public health point of view.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that black and brown people are still getting arrested at higher rates for marijuana possession, even in states with legal weed, so coming out wholeheartedly as a weed smoker still carries some real-life consequences (the prohibition of weed has always been primarily about race).\n\nBut really, the best way to destroy the stereotypical image of a pothead is to replace it with an image that looks more like you and me.

As I am one of the world\u2019s leading scholars on the subject, Wypipology: The Essential Guide to Understanding White People, will be a semiserious satire dissecting my life\u2019s work in the uncharted field of Wypipology. I have no idea who, if anyone, will read it. I just think it\u2019s a funny idea that can also unveil some truth under the guise of comedy.\n\nOn Friday, comedian, actress and world-renowned owner of an unnecessary apostrophe, Mo\u2019Nique, appeared on The Breakfast Club to confront Charlamagne tha God for naming her the \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d in January after Mo\u2019Nique called for Netflix to be placed somewhere between H&M and R. Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people. The probable lack of interest from publishers won\u2019t be based on numbers, analytics or a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them will probably be apprehensive because, like Mo\u2019Nique and Charlamagne, I have a history of publicly pissing off white people. And I, like them, wholeheartedly believe everything I say is entertaining, honest and\u2014most important\u2014correct. But it will probably cost me. I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this:\n\nHey, my loves,\n\nBecause of discrimination and bias, I\u2019m calling for us to come together as a people and stand with me in this boycott against all books and everything white, including Apple chargers, Q-Tips and granulated sugar, until a publisher presents me with a check for $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love us, for real.", "keywords": ["say", "spoiler", "donkey", "answer", "wrong", "white", "women", "netflix", "im", "monique", "charlamagne", "tha", "alert", "calling", "face", "black"], "polarity": 0.06354760006075795, "subjectivity": 0.4925099206349207},

Lane Bryant had an incredible sale: any single bra for $29.50. On Thanksgiving night, I bought four bras on their website. On Black Friday, I bought six more. I felt accomplished. This was a big fucking deal. I couldn\u2019t keep it to myself. I had to share it with all my ample-bosomed sistren.\n\nThe big-boob struggle is real.\n\nI wear a size 42H. My boobs have been here to stay since seventh grade. I went from completely flat-chested to a C cup virtually overnight. I never had a training bra. They went from nonexistent straight into being in the way before I was even ready. It is a family trait passed down from my grandmother. I\u2019ve learned to accept it.\n\nThe first day I realized they were going to be the thing that would always draw attention to me was the day I intercepted a note in class that was meant for someone else.\n\n\u201cIf you want to see some big ass titties, look at Monique Judge,\u201d the note read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving large breasts is both a gift and a curse. It\u2019s the first thing people notice about me. Men don\u2019t look me in the eye because their gaze is drawn to my chest. I at times get accused of accentuating my breasts, when, in fact, they are just fucking there and I can\u2019t help it.\n\nThere\u2019s the constant nagging back pain. The inability to ever go braless without looking like a lunatic. And because I have large, pendulous breasts, I am resigned to the fact that when I lie on my back, they will go their separate ways like two bitches beefing with each other.\n\nSeriously. You do not understand the struggle that is trying to wrangle these broads into the same picture when some dude asks for a photo of me without a shirt and bra on. Even with a selfie stick, that shit is a Shakespearean dramedy in 10 acts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an effort to make the best of it, I work to always wear a good, supportive bra\u2014and that is the biggest part of the struggle.\n\nIf I want a good bra that is going to provide good support and lift while not leaving my boobs dangling down by my navel, I have to spend upward of $60 a pop; $60 for one bra. I envy you A- and B-cup wearers who can walk into Victoria\u2019s Secret and buy a cute bra for $20. Her alphabet doesn\u2019t even go up to my size.\n\n\n\nNot to mention, not all big bras are created equal. Our options for good bras are limited. There are some stores out there, which will go unnamed, that will sell you an expensive-ass bra that falls apart after one or two wears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is it so hard to find good bras for big boobs at a good price? It\u2019s so unfair.\n\nAnd when you do find a good, supportive bra, you are suffering for aesthetics. Underwires dig into your skin, sometimes leaving bruising and scars in their wake. The straps bear the weight of your breasts (because big boobs are also very heavy; I\u2019m sure mine weigh at least 50 pounds all on their own) and leave indentations in your shoulders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBig boobs are all pain and all struggle.\n\nBut when you find a good bra that supports and lifts and makes them look good? They look good.\n\nI have had good luck with the bras I\u2019ve bought from Lane Bryant, despite the cost. They have a few lines that I absolutely love, including one I recently discovered that is now a standout favorite. They have a wide range of sizes from 32DD up to 50DDD. They also have large cup sizes including F, G and H. Here are a few of my favorites from them:\n\nFirst of all, you cannot go wrong with the Lane Bryant full-coverage bra. It offers great support and comes in a wide variety of colors. There are also lined, lightly lined and unlined options. My favorite is the cotton no-wire, unlined option. My boobs sit straight up in this bra. There is a ton of support, and the bra is not killing me by the end of the day. This bra is currently my favorite for everyday wear. It\u2019s just an all-around good bra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to have some sexy with your support, I recommend either the balconette line or the plunge line. I wore the cotton boost plunge bra recently at The Root 100 gala, and all night, people were telling me how delicious my boobs looked.\n\nFinally, the T-shirt bras are soft, comfortable and come in a few different fits. I like that they come in a bunch of colors, and you can find matching panties for them if that is your thing.\n\nThe big-titty struggle is indeed real, but you are not alone, my sisters. I\u2019m here with you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you got \u2019em, flaunt \u2019em. Get a sponsor and get some good bras and let those girls flourish.\n\nI will be there to let you know when a good bra sale is happening.\n\n*Shimmies.*", "keywords": ["real", "boobs", "bra", "struggle", "wear", "bras", "good", "look", "bigboob", "breasts", "support", "big"], "polarity": 0.19956072351421186, "subjectivity": 0.4994324473975638},

This isn\u2019t debatable. He\u2019s such an asshole that God\u2019s greatest grandma, Coretta Scott King, once wrote a letter to block Sessions from becoming a federal judge. One of his major policies since becoming attorney general has been green-lighting policy that allows police to take the cash and/or property of people suspected of but not charged with crimes. He\u2019s a liar who\u2019s been caught lying about his interactions with Russia.\n\n\n\nAnd as if you need any more proof that Sessions is an asshole, he hates weed with a passion normally reserved for scorned lovers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this newly released video obtained by ABC News under the Freedom of Information Act might be the biggest proof of what a complete asshole Sessions is.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer portion with Justice Department interns, Sessions was addressed by a University of California, Berkeley School of Law student who noted that his question came with the memory of Philando Castile and Michael Brown, two African Americans who were killed by police officers in separate incidents that drew national attention, and others who have \u201cfallen victim to excessive force.\u201d\n\nThe student added that he \u201cgrew up in the projects to a single mother, and the people who we are afraid of are not necessarily our neighbors but the police.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions interrupted so the student never got the chance to actually ask a question and noted, \u201cWell, that may be the view in Berkeley, but it\u2019s not the view in most places in the country.\u201d\n\nThe student tried to interject that he wasn\u2019t talking about Berkeley, but why would that stop Sessions? Sessions continued by saying that the over-policing of black communities is needed to \u201cconfront violent crime in America in cities that have abandoned traditional police activity like Baltimore and Chicago.\u201d Sessions also pushed a popular right-wing narrative that murder rates \u201chave surged, particularly in poor neighborhoods,\u201d which thereby constitutes over-policing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that Sessions\u2019 position was dismissive as the way in which he cavalierly acted as if the student had no fucking clue what he was talking about. It also doesn\u2019t help that the student never got to ask a question because the asshole just couldn\u2019t wait to interrupt and answer something that wasn\u2019t asked.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let\u2019s move over to the peak level of Sessions\u2019 assholishness.\n\nHere\u2019s how Politico described the interaction:\n\nAnother student, a woman attending Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, told the attorney general that \u201cstatistically, guns kill more people than marijuana does.\u201d \u201cYou support pretty harsh policies for marijuana and pretty lax gun control laws \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure where you stand on the assault weapons ban,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I\u2019d like to know, since guns kill more people than marijuana, why lax laws on one and harsh laws on the other?\u201d Sessions laughed and called her question one of \u201capples and oranges\u201d before remarking: \u201cThe Second Amendment \u2014 you\u2019re aware of that \u2014 guarantees the right of the American people to keep arms, and I intend to defend that Second Amendment. It\u2019s as valid as the First Amendment.\u201d The attorney general knocked the notion that marijuana is \u201charmless\u201d and \u201cdoes no damage.\u201d \u201cMarijuana is not a healthy substance, in my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican Medical Association is crystal clear on that. Do you believe that?\u201d The student hesitated. \u201cUhh, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cOK. Dr. Whatever Your Name Is, you can write the AMA and see why they think otherwise,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Asshole Book of Commandments, Chapter 6, verse 1, it clearly states that giving someone a title that you know they don\u2019t have to prove that they don\u2019t know what they are talking about makes you an asshole. It wasn\u2019t as if the students were being belligerent. Based on his policy and position, they were asking for clarity, but you know what they say about asking assholes questions: You\u2019re bound to get shitty answers.\n\nYou can watch the video here.\n\nAlso, fuck Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead more at ABC News and Politico.", "keywords": ["belief", "asshole", "department", "confirms", "justice", "video", "question", "complete", "widely", "know", "marijuana", "wasnt", "sessions", "jeff", "talking", "held", "attorney", "student", "general"], "polarity": 0.1055940129053336, "subjectivity": 0.49059939012769194},

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple were very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have to fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on the air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["men", "totally", "real", "history", "lightskinned", "walkoff", "envys", "dj", "moment", "envy", "passiveaggressive", "desus", "tantrum", "wife", "mero", "radio"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

What a waste of UGK and Outkast, man.\n\nAnyway\u2026\n\n1. First of all, Tomi Lahren didn\u2019t create shit\n\nSidenote, you know a Black person is mad when we begin a sentence with \u201cfirst of all.\u201d There usually isn\u2019t a second of all, it\u2019s just a signal that we have a menagerie of qualms about some dumb shit somebody just said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTomi Lahren is not a creator.

Umm\u2026Black women are doing the damn thing\n\nWhile propping up Darth Neo-Con Becky, Charlamagne completely erased the Black women in entertainment and media who actually do the work he said we need to do. Did Franchesca Ramsey disappear all of a sudden? Crissle claps back at White foolishment on multiple media outlets on a regular. Luvvie Ajayi has become a national treasure. Kimberly Foster built up For Harriet with nothing but grit and started creating regular video content. Ava DuVernay is making award-winning films and documentaries and addictive TV shows. (Editor's note: There's also Morgan Debaun, Evelyn From The Internets, Another Round, Aisha Harris's Represent podcast at Slate, my cousin sarah huny young\u2026)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, there are hundreds of Black women who work their asses off to get a voice in this uber-competitive field but there\u2019s this little thing called WHITE PRIVILEGE THAT MAKES IT KINDA HARD FOR BLACK WOMEN TO RECEIVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANCES AND CHANCES TO FAIL THAT WHITE WOMEN DO.\n\n3. Charlamagne is Anti-Ciara Twitter personified\n\nCTG is the type of nigga who gets mad at a Black woman for dealing with an ain\u2019t-shit dude and also for moving on from said dude. Basically, he's chair, CEO, and majority owner of Future Hive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a Black women rants regularly in the media, she's angry. If we move like Gs in silence like lasagna, we're not being loud enough. For men like him, we can't ever do right. (Unless you're his dermatologist. He whips out mentions of homegirl like she's the token Black best friend.)\n\nNot only do the Donkey Every Day's comments smack of ignorance, but they display the type of vitriol some Black dudes can have for Black women regardless of what we do. His original tweet\u2014which started the firestorm of clapbacks against him\u2014 wasn\u2019t an innocent observation. It was an accusation.

It\u2019s an oxymoron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne day in September, I asked the ladies of the Twitter timeline to tell me of their worst experience of a dude with a big one not being up for the challenge, and I got a lot of responses, but this one in particular sums it all up:\n\n\n\nIn short (heh), size only matters if you know what the fuck you are doing with it. You can\u2019t be out here wasting women\u2019s time with your big thang if you have no stroke game\u2014or worst yet, a quick fucking draw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a gentleman I had to kick off my hotation roster earlier this year because he was guilty of the big-bat-strikeout crime.\n\nThis man was working with a smooth 9 1/2 inches of girthy, godly goodness and had the weakest stroke imaginable. That shit was equivalent to a Facebook poke\u2014that is to say, it was fucking nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so disappointed. I wanted him to be great. He, apparently, did not want himself to be great. How do you reach 40 years of age with all that pipe and not learn how to use it? This man had been married, for fuck\u2019s sake. Twice! I just don\u2019t get it.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd here\u2019s another thing: Don\u2019t be out here catfishing us on the size of your dick or your stroke game. You are asking for giggles and chuckles in the bedroom with that shit. Let me give you an example.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll right, so boom. I used to work with this guy who had a really nice body. He was muscular, but not overly so. He was the right amount of thick. He looked like he would be able to handle this load if I were to throw it on his ass. I was curious, and after a while, I found out he was, too.\n\nAfter we spent a month or so flirting back and forth, his comments began to get more and more overtly sexual. He kept saying he was going to \u201cbreak my back\u201d and things like that. In retrospect, that should have been my first clue. Most dudes with big thangs and good stroke don\u2019t have to do a whole lot of talking about it. The proof is in the pudding.\n\nIn any case, after about the 20,340,239,840,238,420,348th comment about how good he could give it to me, I was like, \u201cOK, you don\u2019t have to talk me to damn death. What\u2019s good?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe made arrangements for him to come over to my apartment after his shift at work.\n\nI went home and did the usual prep. I scented my sheets, changed the light bulb, bathed and got myself all lotioned up and smelling good, and waited for him to arrive.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he did, we didn\u2019t waste any time, because why? We went right into my bedroom to do what he came to do.\n\n\n\nAs we are lying there and he is fumbling his way through a most mediocre foreplay performance (ooh, another post idea for another day, \u2019cause some of y\u2019all fucking suck at foreplay), I reach my hand down to his crotch to give it the size test.\n\nI am alarmed, because I don\u2019t feel much of anything. I think to myself that maybe he just isn\u2019t very aroused yet\u2014and then I feel insulted because, bitch, I\u2019m ME.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut whatever. I push forward. I tell him to take his pants off, and he does, providing me with better access to the anaconda he is supposedly wielding. I reach down to grab it, and the slippery little worm is barely worth me using all my fingers to hold. I could have legit just rubbed him with my thumb and forefinger and he would have been just fine. Now I\u2019m pissed.\n\nGIF\n\nHe starts to get harder, if that is even such a thing for someone with his limited scope, and apparently he is ready because he asks me, \u201cDo you have any condoms?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, I say, \u201cYes, but they\u2019re Magnums.\u201d\n\nMy smart-ass comment flies over his head the way size flew over his dick, and he asks me to give him one.\n\nI do it, against my better judgment.\n\nHe gets a good six or seven strokes in before he blows his load, just like he is blowing this sexual experience for me. Then, to add insult to injury, he pulls out\u2014pulling his miniature member out of the condom as he does so. The condom, having done its job the best it could, dangles out of me lifelessly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOops,\u201d he says, \u201cmy bad,\u201d and quickly grabs it.\n\nI smack my lips, and my pussy smacks her lips too, like, can you believe this shit?\n\nHe has the nerve to ask, \u201cDid you come?\u201d\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSir. Could you not?\n\n\n\nI hit him with the smooth, \u201cSo whatchu \u2019bout to do?\u201d\n\nHe takes the hint and puts his pants back on.\n\nI escorted him out of my door so quickly, I don\u2019t think I even said \u201cbye.\u201d Just pushed him out, locked my apartment, got my vibrator and finished the fucking job myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI cannot with you poseurs.\n\n(As a sidenote, me and @steenfox were discussing starting a #ReclaimingMyPussyTime movement. This really needs to happen.)\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, here\u2019s the deal. No, size does not always matter. There are big dicks that suck just as much as, if not more than, little dicks.\n\n\n\nStroke matters. Longevity matters. Stamina matters.\n\nFocus on those things, and we won\u2019t care how big it is. There is some truth to the old saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the ship; it\u2019s the motion of the ocean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love big dicks.

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger. What we\u2019re learning is that some of the strongest forms of activism is when you hit a muthafucka in their pockets. Period.

South Africans were generally friendly, but I was struck by how optimistic they were about the future of the country even though apartheid had only ended, like, 15 minutes ago (1991, to be exact). I couldn\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t more enraged and bitter. One night at dinner, I asked one of my colleagues why.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here in a restaurant that you couldn\u2019t eat at when you were 16 years old because of apartheid. That\u2019s not ancient history. That\u2019s high school. Doesn\u2019t that make you angry still?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe last \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign was probably taken down 10 years before I was born\u2014but black Americans are still pissed about racism, past and ongoing.\u201d\n\nShe considered my question for a minute, probably thinking of a way to explain a lot of complicated history to an American outsider.\n\n\u201cWell, we got our country back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re home; it\u2019s our land. You fought and you\u2019re still in a place that doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\nThat simple conversation explains a lot about the current social media flap about conservative host Tomi Lahren, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah and radio personality Charlamagne tha God from The Breakfast Club. Sometimes our legitimate black anger doesn\u2019t let us see what\u2019s going on and blinds us to how blacks in the Diaspora view American race relations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trevor Noah interviewed the Blaze\u2019s Tomi Lahren last week, no one predicted that it would create so many trending hot takes. Objectively, Noah\u2019s interview with Lahren was pretty good. Many of his longtime, mostly white, media critics turned away from their Jon Stewart memorial shrines long enough to praise Noah for coming into his own. Many black pundits and Twitterati did drive-by analyses of the interview after it went viral (because let\u2019s be honest; The Daily Show audience doesn\u2019t boast a regular large black viewership). The general consensus was either 1) Noah let Lahren off too easy or 2) he never should\u2019ve given her bigoted views a platform to begin with.\n\nSome of this early criticism by black Twitter wasn\u2019t exactly fair, since, unless you\u2019re a fan of his work, judging Trevor Noah\u2019s comedy and progressive chops by his one interview with Tomi Lahren is akin to judging Dave Chappelle by his \u201cGive Trump a chance\u201d monologue on Saturday Night Live and ignoring anything else he\u2019s done in comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, when Charlamagne tha God, faux woke comedian and professional troll from the radio show The Breakfast Club, was caught playing Instagram footsie angling for an interview with Lauren, black Twitter called the Drop Squad. Suddenly Charlamagne, and Noah, were sellouts, seduced by a White She-Devil and unwittingly giving a platform to increasingly bold white supremacists in this post-Trump America.\n\nTrevor Noah, relatively new to this game, is being dragged by Twitter for something he never did.\n\nI am a huge fan of Noah\u2019s brand of political humor and have been ever since I saw the documentary about his life, You Laugh but It\u2019s True, at a film festival in 2012. Since he took over The Daily Show in 2015, his critics have accused him of, basically, not being Jon Stewart. Trevor Noah doesn\u2019t embody the East Coast white liberal outrage that other Daily Show alums like John Oliver and Samantha Bee have honed with laserlike efficiency. For black folks wanting searing racial political humor, Larry Wilmore was on Comedy Central for a year picking up the slack. Noah didn\u2019t have the burden of being both black and white America\u2019s political-comedy catharsis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of that is different now with the election of white-nationalist-sympathizing Donald Trump. Black people are legitimately scared. In this age of creeping white nationalism, if a liberal host (especially a black one) has a conservative guest, anything short of a gladiator-style verbal evisceration, followed by a slow thumbs-down and a tossing of bloody rhetorical entrails to the audience for sport, is tantamount to collusion with the enemy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Trevor Noah\u2019s style, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. He\u2019s more Yakov Smirnoff than Paul Mooney. He\u2019s an outsider more bemused than enraged by our politics.\n\nIf there is any criticism I have of Noah in the wake of this fake controversy, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend enough time sharing how his worldview differs from the audience's. His best comedy is when he flips our flawed democracy into typical politics throughout Africa. As a child, he lived through apartheid, which was like the Batman of white supremacy; it took the best parts of racism from around the world and perfected it \u2026 at the expense of 85 percent of the population for 70 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust because Noah\u2019s comedy is more driven by the philosophy of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee than our Western notions of getting revenge and getting even doesn\u2019t make him soft on bigotry. Treating Lahren nicely after his show is no worse a crime than my South African colleagues tipping a white waiter in a restaurant that used to not serve blacks. Sometimes you show power by not letting bigots dictate your behavior.\n\nOver the next four (likely eight) years, there will be plenty of white-nationalist-sympathizing conservatives out there, and plenty of black media people who will try to suck up to them. Charlamagne tha God is a professional provocateur who thought he\u2019d get some clicks and some good trolling out of dangling a \u201cpretty white girl\u201d in front of his mostly black audience. But even he realized that he was playing himself.\n\nNoah, who perforated Lahren\u2019s bigotry for 20 minutes, shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crossfire of shade bullets aimed at Charlamagne. He\u2019s bringing good comedy and satire from a perspective that could do us some good in these coming trying times. Perhaps next time, black Twitter should listen to more than his comedy highlights before burying him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

This is going to be fun for me, and I hope it is fun and enjoyable for you as well. Here we go.\n\nI don\u2019t know how or why I went my whole adult life without ever getting waxed down below, but here we are. To be fair, I was never \u201cTeen Wolf\u201d down there or anything, and I mostly handled it in the shower with a razor\u2014but you can only do so much with a razor, as we all know. There are parts of a lady\u2019s special place that you wouldn\u2019t want to put a razor near or risk getting cut. For those places, there is waxing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI will admit that I was hesitant for a long while because all I could think about was how painful it must be. I asked all my friends who I know either wax or sugar their lady bits about the process, and most of them told me that yes, it does, in fact, hurt, but it\u2019s well worth it in the end. It took a while for me to be convinced.\n\n\n\nThe turning point for me came in September when a picture of a young lady\u2019s freshly waxed and perfectly greased-up love box floated down the Twitter timeline. I couldn\u2019t stop staring. It was fucking beautiful. I wanted that beauty for myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI made a decision. Fuck it, I thought. I\u2019m doing this.\n\nI asked my women friends in Los Angeles if they knew of a good spot I could go to that was clean and reputable. My girl Genoa referred me to a place in downtown L.A. called Wax Candy. She said she had been there before and had good experiences. I trusted her judgment, so I looked up their website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir service menu included tips for what to do before and after getting waxed, as well as a diagram showing which parts each type of wax covered. I decided to go with the Brazilian, because if you gonna do it, do it right. Right?\n\nI called on a Friday afternoon and made an appointment for the next morning. That entire night, I stressed myself out thinking about it. Was it going to hurt? How long would it hurt? Was I going to like the outcome? Were my man friends going to like the outcome? Why did I say I was going to do this?\n\nI asked again on the Twitter timeline for tips. People gave me all kinds of helpful advice. Exfoliate before going. Take Advil or Aleve 30 minutes to an hour before the service. Wear loose clothing so as not to irritate it afterward. Moisturize beforehand so it\u2019s easier for the hair to come out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhen Saturday morning came around, I got out of bed and began the process of talking myself out of going. I called my best friend for moral support. I wanted her to tell me it was OK to chicken out. She was having none of that.\n\n\n\n\u201cBitch,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk around with your pussy looking like your mama\u2019s. Go get the damn wax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat did it. I got in the shower and took extra care cleaning, because the last thing I wanted was for someone to be nose-deep in my love spot and be like, \u201cDamn, bitch. Did you at least rinse it off?\u201d\n\nBefore putting on my clothes, I slathered as much body butter as I thought I could get away with on the outer surfaces. I wanted to leave no room for error. Right before leaving the house, I popped two Aleve and prayed for the best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowntown L.A. is a nightmare when it comes to parking, so instead of driving, I took an Uber. The driver pulled up in front of Wax Candy, and I took a deep breath before getting out of the car. He probably thought that I was going through something, and he was right; I was. I still wasn\u2019t convinced I was going to be OK, but it was too late to back out. We here now.\n\n\n\nI walked inside and a friendly receptionist greeted me. I signed in on the guest list, and because it was my first time, I may have signed some other paper, but I don\u2019t remember now because everything at that point was a blur.\n\nThe receptionist introduced me to my waxer, Allie. Allie was a cheerful, friendly brown girl on the right side of plus-size, and I was immediately set at ease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe led me to the waxing room and instructed me to take off my pants and underwear. I decided at the last moment to do my underarms as well, so she told me to go ahead and get completely naked. She offered me a paper gown in case I was too modest to let her see me naked.\n\nI did as instructed and lay on the table waiting for her to return. When she did, she told me she was going to start with my underarms.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIs it going to hurt?\u201d I asked.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt depends,\u201d she answered honestly. \u201cIt can. I\u2019ll do one strip and see how you feel.\u201d\n\nShe did one strip under my left arm and it was so quick, I felt nothing. I was amazed. She quickly waxed under both underarms, and I felt like a champion because nothing made me wince or cry. I hoped the waxing of my pudenda would go just as smoothly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Brazilian wax involves removing all the hair from the front, sides and labia as well as your inner \u201ctushy.\u201d\n\nShe started at the top, just under my FUPA. I ain\u2019t gonna lie, those first few strips hurt, but it was a quick hurt. The pain lasted only as long as it took her to remove the strip from my skin. She pressed down on each place she waxed, and that seemed to reduce the pain and the length of time it lingered by a great deal.\n\nFrom my FUPA, she moved to the top of my vulva, then the sides, and finally inside the labia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire time, she kept me distracted with good conversation and laughter.\n\nI know, it\u2019s hard to imagine engaging in laughter while someone is waxing your lady bits, but we really were having a good conversation and laughing all the way through it as she serviced me.\n\nThe service involves putting your legs in the butterfly position and at times lifting one leg or the other to provide the waxer access. I got through all the positions just fine, and again, most of it was relatively painless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWe finally reached the part of the service where she had to wax the inside of my butt crack.\n\n\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I need you to do is lift your legs and pull your knees as close to your chest as possible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe, knowing all my years of being a ho were finally about to pay off:\n\nGIF\n\nI pulled my legs all the way back and let my feet touch the wall behind my head.\n\n\n\nShe was like, \u201cOK, girl. I didn\u2019t mean all of that.\u201d\n\nI relaxed, and she finished that part of the wax. We were done.\n\nShe got a mirror and handed it to me so I could inspect. As I did, she went over me with a pair of tweezers to make sure she hadn\u2019t missed anything, not much unlike what your eyebrow waxer does. Because she was so thorough, there wasn\u2019t a lot for her to grab with tweezers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you I fell in love with my pussy all over again ... bitch, I feel in love with my pussy all over again. She was so pretty. And smooth! Touching the top of my mound felt like heaven.\n\nI spent the next week finding reasons to touch it when I was alone. I started doing it so much, I had to consciously remind myself not to reach down there in public. I\u2019m not exaggerating. It was so damn soft. Amazingly smooth to the touch.\n\n\n\nI vowed that I would get waxed forever and ever after that. And here comes the downside to it: In order to get waxed, the hair has to have grown to about the size of a fake eyelash. If you can lift it up with your fingers, there\u2019s enough hair to be waxed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, it took about six weeks to grow back to that point. It took another two before I was able to secure another appointment with Allie.\n\nI saw her again on Saturday. This time I felt like a pro, and I was ready. She didn\u2019t have to ease me into it. And because I had already been waxed before, the second process went even quicker than the first. We were done in about 10 minutes.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she was done, I made a request that I thought she might balk at, but she took it all in stride.\n\n\n\nI asked her to oil my girl up and take pictures of her using my phone.\n\nY\u2019all, Allie turned into a damn photographer shooting a model. She caught my girl from so many angles, and all the pictures looked beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have been using them to thirst-trap my male friends ever since.\n\nI cannot recommend getting waxed highly enough.\n\nI got my first-ever Brazilian, y\u2019all, and it literally changed my life.", "keywords": ["took", "wanted", "life", "wax", "brazilian", "waxed", "1stever", "hurt", "getting", "service", "thought", "changed", "girl", "going"], "polarity": 0.20488144078144077, "subjectivity": 0.48138717948717963},

Envy, Charlamagne tha God and Angela Yee.\n\nHill not only talked about his road to success\u2014from dropping out of Morehouse to homelessness, from selling incense on the streets of Atlanta to receiving a Ph.D.\u2014but also made it clear that when it comes to the 2016 presidential election, there is no \"lesser of two evils\" in our current political duopoly.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois said in 1956, \u201cI believe that democracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no \u2018two evils\u2019 exist.\u201d Hill takes that philosophy and makes it plain.\n\n\n\nThe DNC disappointed me because it looked like a Republican convention. \u2026 \u201c[Democrats] tried to take the patriotism language that the Republicans usually use in their conferences and used it for their own. They talked about war. They talked about the economy in a way that sounded like Republicans from 20 years ago. Part of the reason it was so easy for Melania to jack Michelle Obama\u2019s speech is because they\u2019re all saying the same stuff. I'm not scared of Trump. I'm scared of us as a country moving in the wrong direction. \u2026 Republicans are always talking about terrorism, but Democrats are playing on a certain kind of terrorism, too. They're essentially saying, \u2018If you don't vote for us, then you're going to have Donald Trump and your life will be ruined.\u2019 If you frame that as the choice, you never get to demand what you actually deserve and what you actually want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen D.J. Envy asked did Hill \"like\" Hillary Clinton, he responded unapologetically:\n\n\n\nI wouldn't vote for her. I'm voting for the Green Party. \u2026 They're not going to win this election. But if the differences between the two candidates aren't vast enough, then I would rather introduce a third candidate to build a movement. Because every four years we say, 'The third party can't win.' So we never invest in the third party. We never grow the third party. If they get 5 percent of the vote, they can be in the debates. And if they're in the debates, now we can change the conversation.\n\nAfter Envy said that Democrats voting third party would take votes away from Clinton, ultimately paving the way for a Donald Trump presidency, Hill laid the truth on the table:\n\n\n\nI would rather have Trump be president for four years and build a real left-wing movement that can get us what we deserve as a people, than to let Hillary be president and we stay locked in the same space where we don't get what we want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill went on to say that he would rather Trump not be president, period, but that we can't keep investing in \"imperfect Democrats who don't take us anywhere.\"\n\n\n\nWe can afford to lose an election; we can't afford to lose our values.\n\nWatch below for Hill talking more Trump, \"black-on-black\" crime as pathology and Drake's \"light-skin\" music:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on The Root: \u201cDear Centrists: The Left Has Something to Say Whether You Like It or Not\u201d", "keywords": ["democrats", "talked", "say", "president", "vote", "election", "theyre", "green", "republicans", "party", "values", "trump", "voting", "afford", "hill", "marc", "lose", "lamont"], "polarity": 0.07415824915824916, "subjectivity": 0.40971620971620976},

Or just a conservative. Or capital letter White. Or even very problematic.\n\nNo, she is an abjectly awful person. She says abhorrent and hateful things, and has leveraged this abhorrence and hate to give herself a larger platform to infect more people with it and make more money off of it. She is willfully and dangerously ignorant, is either unaware of or unconcerned with historical context, and also seems to have no problem inciting violence against people protesting and brutalized by it. If Heaven exists \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 and what we believe to be true about Heaven is actually true, if she died today she would not be there tomorrow.\n\nShe is also young, petite, and very blonde; characteristics that, in tandem, are considered by very many people to be the three most desirable things a woman can be. If she appeared on screen and the TV happened to be on mute and you happened to not be paying much attention to it, you could easily mistake her for Kristen Bell or Emilia Clarke.\n\nThis \u2014 her appearance and youth and physical presence \u2014 seems to be incongruent with who she actually is. It's not at all, of course. She is, again, a terrible fucking person. (Do not forget this.) But everything America encourages us to believe about how terrible and dangerous people are supposed to look and sound (not like Tomi Lahren) and the type of people people who look like Tomi Lahren are supposed to be (not terrible and dangerous) suggests otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular strain of socialization also ignores history. Tomi Lahrens are directly responsible for false arrests, beatings, whippings, lynchings, and even executions. If you watch the footage of Ruby Bridges desegregating William Frantz Elementary, or Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals desegregating Little Rock Central High, you'll see dozens of Tomi Lahrens on the front lines, clutching signs, hurling stones, and spewing hate; their pretty little blonde fucking faces twisted, evil, and cruel.\n\nBut their looks have granted them the privilege of consideration. Sometimes even kindness. (And sometimes even cupcakes.) Because women that young, that blonde, that petite just can't possibly also be that hateful. It's unfathomable that they could genuinely be this vile and wicked. So maybe a conversation might sway them. Or an invitation to a show. Or a hug. Or a drink. Or a date even. Or a dick inside of them. Or, shit, maybe even having a kid with them might do it. It never does, of course. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. But that doesn't stop us from trying. (If it's not obvious already, \"us\" in this context is \"Black men.\")\n\nWhile both history and the present inform us that we should be impervious to whichever charms we believe they possess \u2014 that our lives can literally depend on refusing to be seduced by them \u2014 we still allow it to happen. We still want to acknowledge and engage them. We still want to be nice to them. Perhaps with the hope that they'll acknowledge and engage us in return. But all this does is validate them. It gives them credibility for engaging us; which, in the eyes of their friends and fans and followers, is effectively and bravely slumming. It promotes their brands and boosts their platforms. It buys them more airtime and unlimited bleach. It provides them an alibi for their hate. Because Tomi Lahren can't really be racist if she's getting drinks with Trevor and mean mugging with Charlamagne. Look how fun she looks!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when we allow that to happen, we're not brave. We're not sober. We're not attempting to find a common ground. We're not extending an olive branch.

She was a product of a relationship between her mother, Mary Elizabeth Fogg (who we had been told was 100 percent Cherokee), and a white landowner named Hal Witherspoon. Their relationship was such that they lived next door to each other; he never married or had other family.\n\nMy dad and his siblings grew up knowing Hal Witherspoon, and when he died, he left all of his property to my grandmother. My grandmother and one of her sisters attended St. Augustine School, which was actually walking distance from their home, but Witherspoon hired a carriage and driver to take them around the corner every Sunday and return them from school on Fridays.\n\nCan you please help me to learn more about the origins of Mary Elizabeth Fogg and Hal Witherspoon? \u2014Nedra Farrar Swift\n\nThe paper trail we found on your great-grandmother Mary Elizabeth Fogg and Hal Witherspoon suggests two people who went to great lengths to be near each other during a time in American history when interracial relationships were taboo and marriage across the color line was illegal in many states. In their home state of North Carolina, whites were prohibited from marrying black or Native American people until the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Loving v. Virginia decision overturned that ban in 1967 and legalized interracial marriage nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid They Have Two Households or One?\n\nLike you, we started with census records to learn as much as we could about Hal Weatherspoon and Mary Elizabeth Fogg. One of the first things we noted is that according to census records, his first name was William and middle name Henry. Hal was clearly a nickname. Also, in various records, his surname was spelled Witherspoon or Weatherspoon.\n\nIn 1920, Mary and her son, Samuel, were residing at 719 S. East St. in Raleigh, Wake County, N.C. (via FamilySearch; free registration required). Directly next door at 721 S. East St. lived Wm. Henry Weatherspoon, who was born about 1859 at North Carolina. This census recorded that Mary was born in Georgia about 1868 and was a widow. Keep in mind that \u201cwidow\u201d was often a term used on census records for women who had been abandoned by their husbands or perhaps had never married but had children, which, based on your family story, may be the case in this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTen years later, William H. Weatherspoon and Mary Elizabeth Fogg were recorded as neighbors in Raleigh, Wake County, N.C. William H. was 71 years old, placing his birth about 1859 at North Carolina. Mary Elizabeth was 55 years old, placing her birth about 1875. This census also tells you that William H. owned his home and that Mary Elizabeth rented her home, possibly from Hal, based on the proximity. The marital status of each suggests a previous relationship for both parties, with William H. recorded as divorced and Mary Elizabeth recorded as a widow. Mary\u2019s son, Samuel K. Fogg, born about 1903, was also residing in her household.\n\nIn 1940, William H. Weatherspoon was still residing on South East Street in Raleigh, Wake County, N.C., though Mary Elizabeth Fogg is not recorded anywhere near him. William was recorded as being born about 1859 at North Carolina and was divorced, which matched the other records we located for him.\n\nWe located a death record for W. Hal Weatherspoon on March 8, 1943, at Raleigh, Wake County, N.C. The record states that he was born in January 1859 at Wake County and that his parents were Benjamin Weatherspoon and Carolina Barber. His address at the time of his death was 721 S. East St., and he was buried at the City Cemetery in Raleigh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe searched the Wake County Grantors Index for a land record that might mention the land he left to his children, but we did not locate a transfer of land from William Hal Witherspoon. Working the other direction, we also did not locate a deed in which a person with the surname \u201cFogg\u201d received land from anyone with the surname \u201cWitherspoon.\u201d Since the land transfer was not recorded in a deed, you will likely want to search for a probate record for William Hal Weatherspoon, since he may have bequeathed the property in his will.\n\nWe tried to work backward in time, too. We located Mary E. Fogg residing at 719 S. East St., Raleigh, in 1910 with her children, Bessie, David and Samuel, but William Hal Witherspoon is not residing in or near the household. We know from other records that this is an address associated with him, so perhaps Mary and her children were residing on his property.\n\nWe could not locate William Hal Weatherspoon in the 1910 census in Wake County, regardless of how we searched. It could be that his name was transcribed into a database incorrectly, so you may want to browse the census page by page for anyone around Mary Elizabeth Fogg who could be William Hal Witherspoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Possible Origin of a Familiar Name\n\nWith the information about William Hal Witherspoon\u2019s mother from his death record, we located him residing with his mother, Caroline Weatherspoon, at 719 S. East St. in 1900. It is very likely that your grandmother Caroline \u201cCarrie\u201d Fogg was named for William Hal\u2019s mother. This record again records that William Hal was divorced. His mother, Caroline, was born in November 1829 at North Carolina and had borne four children, three of which were still living in 1900, meaning that William Hal had siblings you could investigate further to learn more about the family. That same year, Mary Elizabeth Fogg was residing at East Cabarrus Street in Raleigh, very close to South East Street. She had six children living with her, including your grandmother Carrie, though the record states she had eight children living.\n\nWilliam Hal resided with his mother as a young man as well. In 1880 he was 21 years old and living in the household of his mother, Caroline Weatherspoon, in South East Raleigh, Wake County. It seems likely that Hal remained on the same location his entire life, perhaps on the same property. We located a Mary Fogg that year who was a single mother of two young children: Annie Fogg, born about 1876, and Delman Dewight, born about 1879. She is in the right place and of the right age to be your Mary Fogg, and both children would have been old enough in 1900 to have resided outside of her home. Given that Delman has a different surname, this may be a child from a previous relationship prior to her relationship with William Hal Witherspoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking further back, we located William Hal as an infant in the household of Simpson Weatherspoon at the North Western District of Wake County, N.C., with his mother, Caroline. Though William Hal\u2019s death record named his father as \u201cBenjamin,\u201d it seems likely that this is the right family and that perhaps Simpson went by a middle name or that by the time of William Hal\u2019s death, the name had been remembered by the informant incorrectly. This record includes two elder sisters for William: Eliza and Nora.\n\nThere is a marriage record for Simpson Weatherspoon and Caroline Barly in Wake County, N.C., on July 4, 1850. As newlyweds, the couple were residing with Clarky Barby in Wake County in 1850. Because Barby or Barbee is a family name in Wake County, it is likely that her surname in her marriage record was a poorly written \u201cBarby.\u201d This gives you yet another generation to search for more information.\n\nWe were unable to definitively take Mary E. Fogg\u2019s line back any further, but you will want to investigate three close matches to her description in the 1870 U.S. census to see if you can determine which one may be her. To do this, trace the families forward to see if you can find one of these Mary Foggs living somewhere when you have a record of your Mary Fogg living elsewhere. This will mean that you can rule them out as a possible match. Anyone you cannot trace forward may be your Mary Fogg and could help you uncover another generation on your Fogg family tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Complicated Question of Mary Fogg\u2019s Identity\n\nAs for whether your great-grandmother was \u201c100 percent Cherokee,\u201d the only records we located for Mary Elizabeth Fogg identify her race only as black or \u201cmulatto.\u201d Since race in census records was often determined by the census taker, this could just be due to a judgment based on the pigment of her skin. However, it could also mean that she was not self-identifying as Cherokee.\n\nAn additional explanation is possible: As we noted in our previous column \u201cWhere Did My Infamous Ancestor Come From?\u201d a 1910 petition by the Croatan Indians of Sampson County, N.C. (roughly 70 miles from Wake County, where Mary Fogg lived), reveals that the white population in the area commonly classified members of the Native population as being black. Read Stacey Ricketts\u2019 posting of \u201cThe Mulatto Classification of Indian Families and Related Laws\u201d for more context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that in mind, we noted a number of people with the surname Fogg included on Cherokee Enrollment records. Many of the applications include detailed interviews about their families and where they originated. We did not locate anyone named Mary mentioned in the few records we reviewed, and it appears that some of these Foggs were from Arkansas, a location we have never seen associated with your Mary Elizabeth Fogg. However, we suggest that you closely examine the records yourself to see if you can find any family details that may connect to your Mary Elizabeth Fogg.\n\nWe also suggest that you take an autosomal DNA test to determine if you have Native American ancestry, if you have not already. These tests are available through companies such as 23andMe, Family Tree DNA and Ancestry.com.\n\nFurthermore, if you identify and connect with living descendants of William Hal Witherspoon\u2019s siblings and they are willing to have their DNA tested (or share the results of DNA tests they have already taken), you could confirm the family connection. The aforementioned companies currently also offer autosomal DNA cousin matching. If you have blood relatives in the Witherspoon family, their DNA may already be in the databases of one or more of these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and founding director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.

Are you about to tell me that the school is bullshit, too?\n\nNo, I\u2019m not.\n\nOK, I\u2019m kidding. The school is bullshit, too. After historically black St. Paul\u2019s College closed its doors in 2014, Shoemake began a campaign to raise money to buy the property with the purpose of opening a school for black boys. People donated what is estimated to be at least $100,000 to bring this dream to fruition, but no one has seen a school. No one has seen a business plan for a school. No certifying educational organization has seen an application. No one knows what happened to the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his recent appearance on The Breakfast Club, he told Charlamagne that he recently saw some land in South Carolina, but quickly told tha God that he\u2019d talk about it \u201coff air.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in The Breakfast Club interview?\n\nLike always, Shoemake made a lot of salient points about interracial marriage, economic empowerment and racism. But like the huckster he is, he sullied his message with dubious claims, nonfacts and flat-out lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike what?\n\nLike when he said Chinese is now an official language of South Africa (It isn\u2019t);\n\n\n\nOr when he explained how black men marry out of their race more than all other races combined (they don\u2019t);\n\n\n\nOr when he talked about his six degrees (maybe he was talking about his thermostat);\n\n\n\nOr when he explained how \u201cBuddha\u201d is translated as \u201cthe black face\u201d (also untrue);\n\n\n\nOr when he talked about how Frederick Douglass marred his legacy by marrying a white woman, beginning the sentence with, \u201cTake my ancestor Frederick Douglass\u201d\u2014a clever sleight of hand that averted the term \u201cdescendant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why do people listen to him?\n\nBecause, like the story of the angels who followed Satan to Earth when he told them how beautiful their voices sounded, Johnson is charismatic, charming and flattering. No one ever tells black people how beautiful their voices are, so many people are eager to join Johnson\u2019s choir.\n\nThe worst part about charlatans like him is that black people\u2019s voices are beautiful, and it is an indictment of America that a snake-oil salesman can sweet-talk so many people into believing whatever he says. There are people who take his words as fact. Right now, in a barbershop somewhere in America, someone is explaining that Buddha\u2019s last name was Jenkins, and how General Tso was a South African leader of the apartheid movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one would be mad at Johnson if he stood in front of audiences and simply said, \u201cThis is what I believe.\u201d His opinions are valid, and many of them reflect the thoughts of the black community as a whole. But he undercuts himself by building his house on a bed of lies.\n\nAnd he steals.\n\nThat\u2019s why he is dangerous. Hypothetically, it would be cool as fuck to hang out with Dracula if all he wanted to do was stay out all night and sleep all day. I\u2019d love to have a homeboy thousands of years old who knows how to talk women into letting him come over to their place. Plus, I\u2019ve always wanted to wear a cape, and it wouldn\u2019t look so out of place if I hung out with an entire crew of cape wearers who weren\u2019t doing superhero cosplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like all vampires, what Dr. Umar Jermaine Shoemake Johnson really wants is to suck the blood out of the black community. He is a con man who rains slick-mouthed compliments down on angels so that he can befriend the black community and suck them dry. Even though it makes our people feel empowered, it is ultimately the worst kind of evil.\n\nBut just like when Satan sings a solo\u2014it sounds so beautiful.", "keywords": ["dr", "seen", "ask", "wanted", "club", "know", "afraid", "douglass", "johnson", "umar", "shoemake", "frederick", "school", "memes", "black"], "polarity": 0.0428313030638612, "subjectivity": 0.5170358065706903},

Envy, Charlamagne tha God and Angela Yee.\n\nHill not only talked about his road to success\u2014from dropping out of Morehouse to homelessness, from selling incense on the streets of Atlanta to receiving a Ph.D.\u2014but also made it clear that when it comes to the 2016 presidential election, there is no \"lesser of two evils\" in our current political duopoly.\n\nW.E.B.

But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

The white man accused of shooting him, Ronald Gasser, was charged with second-degree murder. Gasser\u2019s fate will be decided by a jury with just one black woman on it. Will there be justice for McKnight?\n\nGasser, 56, is accused of gunning down 28-year-old McKnight after a \u201cmutual road rage\u201d car chase during which they allegedly gave each other the finger and called each other names. Gasser\u2019s trial for second-degree murder began Friday. He pleaded not guilty and claimed that the shooting was in self-defense.\n\nOn Monday the jury watched a videotaped interview that took place between detectives and Gasser just one day after he fatally shot McKnight. Gasser told detectives that he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his vehicle, and McKnight was on the passenger side with his hands and upper torso \u201cprimarily in the vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn a prior interview, Gasser had said that he shot McKnight after McKnight made an aggressive lunge toward him. Physical evidence showed that McKnight was not as close as Gasser claimed he was when the shooting occurred, but will that make a difference to the jury?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Aviva Shen points out for In Justice Today, Jefferson Parish\u2014Louisiana\u2019s largest county and also where the trial is taking place\u2014faced accusations of racism immediately following the Dec. 1, 2016, shooting. Although Gasser confessed to shooting McKnight three times in broad daylight, he was initially released without any charges by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nThen-Sheriff Newell Normand claimed in a Dec. 6, 2016, news conference that race wasn\u2019t a factor in the case, then proceeded to read from messages full of expletives and racial slurs that he said had been directed at him and other officials as a result of their handling of the case.\n\nThis is the same Jefferson Parish where former Sheriff Harry Lee said in 2006: \u201cWe know the crime is in the black community. Why should I waste time in the white community?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJefferson Parish is a county where blacks make up more than 25 percent of the population, but only one black woman is on the Gasser jury.\n\nFrom In Justice Today:\n\nJefferson Parish has a habit of keeping black residents off juries. A 2003 report by the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, a capital defense nonprofit, found that Jefferson Parish prosecutors removed black prospective jurors in felony trials at more than three times the rate they removed white ones. Though racial discrimination in juries is unconstitutional, the Louisiana Supreme Court has studiously ignored most challenges. The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design. Louisiana as a whole has one of the worst track records when it comes to its criminal-justice system. It is one of just two states in the country that allow nonunanimous jury verdicts\u2014a system that was put in place to nullify black influence on juries.\n\nAs In Justice Today notes, white men who kill black men in the U.S. are eight times more likely to have that killing ruled as justified.\n\nSo, with just one black woman on a jury full of white people\u2014what does that mean when it comes to justice for Joe McKnight?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will be lucky if we see any justice.\n\nRead more at In Justice Today.", "keywords": ["shooting", "juror", "nfl", "justice", "white", "jefferson", "joe", "woman", "player", "help", "mcknight", "parish", "jury", "black", "gasser"], "polarity": 0.02195379723157501, "subjectivity": 0.36600315322537547},

Greg Doucette, a Durham criminal-defense attorney, told The Root, \u201cIt\u2019s the morally right outcome for sure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoucette said that the dismissals expose the Durham County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cThey spent so much time charging people rather than gathering evidence that 100 percent of the charges they filed have now been dismissed,\u201d he said.\n\nEchols told the Herald Sun that his office had presented all the evidence it had, and since it would have used that same evidence against the five remaining defendants, it made no sense to continue to prosecute the cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor my office to continue to take these cases to trial based on the same evidence would be a misuse of state resources,\u201d Echols said.\n\nEchols told the Herald Sun that his decision to prosecute in the first place was the right one.\n\n\u201cActs of vandalism, regardless of noble intent, are still a violation of law,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoucette told The Root that it was surprising to see the cases dropped\u2014especially with the amount of video evidence available.\n\n\u201cTo have a judge dismiss two cases at the close of the government\u2019s case\u2014before the defense even presents anything\u2014is surprising,\u201d Doucette said.\n\n\u201cTo then find a third not guilty outright, after a full trial, is astonishing,\u201d he continued. \u201cEspecially with how much video was available.

I did not sign up to be no political activist.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment as clear as the color of the sky in Los Angeles on a relatively smogless day.\n\nThe same goes for the rest of the quote: \u201cI wanna talk about my motherf\u2014kin' lean, my best friend dying, the girls that come in and out of my life, the jiggy fashion that I wear, my new inspirations in drugs! I don't wanna talk about no f\u2014king Ferguson and s\u2014t because I don't live over there! I live in f\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills. I can't relate. I'm in the studio; I'm in these fashion studios; I'm in these bitches' drawers. I'm not doing anything outside of that. That's my life.\u201d\n\nSome of us knew of his 2015 TimeOut interview when it was first published. Despite Rocky\u2019s claim in an interview Wednesday with Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club, reading the TimeOut interview in full will do little to alleviate any frustrations with his thought process. And before that radio interview, the Harlem rapper, who now lives in \u201cf\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills,\u201d said something equally clueless while speaking before the Debate Society of Oxford University. During that conversation, Rocky said, \u201cWhy are we exploiting the beef between the urban community and the police force when 60 people got shot on a Friday and Saturday [on a July 2014 holiday weekend] in Chicago in black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nA$AP Rocky\u2019s issue is not that he was misquoted or that his remarks were received differently than intended; it\u2019s that his words have come back to haunt him several months later. They haunt him because as state-sanctioned violence against black people in this country continues to happen, those who enjoy a platform but do not advocate on behalf of black people are widely viewed as part of the problem. In his more recent radio interview, Rocky did not so much offer clarity about previous comments made as he tried to parse his words.\n\nIn his initial response to the social media pile-on, he took to Twitter to take shots at those finding the TimeOut interview late, though he did now acknowledge \u201call this social injustice makes me f\u2014king sick, tho I\u2019m still no politician.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn The Breakfast Club, he said, \"I feel terrible as a black man, as an American. It's crazy. This Donald Trump s\u2014t \u2026 I just don't understand how they keep saying a dark-skinned n\u2014ga don't like black people.\"\n\nStill, he asked, \u201cHow come black lives only matter when a police officer takes it? It should matter when a black life take it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there was one somewhat better explanation about why he does not speak on police brutality:\n\n\n\nYour favorite rappers today\u2014I don't know if it's [Young] Thug, Future, Drake, anybody\u2014you don't always hear their content being about the political s\u2014t going on or all the other s\u2014t. I feel like, why put me on a pedestal for that, especially when I'm not asking for that? I want to make music, I want to inspire, I want to promote peace because at a time like this, I don't have all the answers. I'm not trying to run for Congress or office. I don't have all the answers. I want to promote prosperity especially for black people, especially for just young people, ambitious people, underprivileged. I'm not here to talk about supremacy, who's dominant. It's f\u2014ked up.\n\nAn inconvenient truth is that, as helpful as it is for each of us\u2014especially those with huge platforms\u2014to advocate on behalf of black people in the wake of what\u2019s happening to so many of us, it is still by and large a choice. Moreover, it is a choice that some may elect to do but are unfortunately not equipped to handle. A$AP Rocky can talk about many things with precision: fashion, his flawless skin, the women he screws, the friends he\u2019s lost along the way and whatever else involves his private life. Unfortunately, as he\u2019s made it painfully clear over and over again, social unrest, police brutality and racism are not his forte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who conflate \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d with state-sanctioned violence are of the Stacey Dash school of thinking. It is a pool as deep as a wad of spit on a New York City sidewalk on a hot day in July. There are many other celebrities\u2014namely those minority ones who mistakenly invoke \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d\u2014just like Rocky. They don\u2019t know any better, and while we hope they get better, in the meantime, it\u2019s probably better off for all parties involved if they shut up.\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t put certain celebrities on pedestals and expect more than what they can give intellectually. Even so, if you go out of your way not only to misrepresent the movement but also to lend your black face to a white-contrarian narrative seeking to discount the racism happening in this country, as A$AP Rocky did, then you deserve whatever comes your way.\n\nAct accordingly.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life.

About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while.

When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood.

I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866.

I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land.

My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch.

We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer.

She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks.

At the time, he was 22; his victim, Jules Woodson, was 17.\n\nOn Thursday night, Highpoint Church\u2019s lead pastor, Chris Conlee, announced in a statement that the church had issued Savage a leave of absence to begin immediately.\n\nEarlier:\n\nToday we bring you two accounts of pastors accused of sexually assaulting minors\u2014with two very different endings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one case coming out of Fayetteville, N.C., a former pastor has been charged with 142 charges of child sex crimes, including the rapes of four children. According to WTVD-TV, Glenn Tyrone Collins has been accused of repeatedly sexually abusing children between 1996 and 2009.\n\nThe TV outlet notes that one of the alleged victims was Collins\u2019 neighbor. But a look at the charges against Collins\u2014namely, 39 counts of sexual activity by a parent\u2014indicates that Collins is also accused of abusing one or more of his own children or, at the very least, someone for whom he was the primary guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that they picked up the case after one of Collins\u2019 accusers came forward, describing the alleged abuse as years of emotional torture, according to WTVD-TV. Collins turned himself in to police on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nAt a bond hearing, Collins pleaded with a judge for his release, defended his reputation as a pillar in the community and told the court that he wasn\u2019t \u201cguilty of this stuff.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, the former pastor was being held at the Cumberland County Jail on a $3.75 million bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs North Carolina police were securing warrants against Collins, in Memphis, Tenn., a pastor of a megachurch there received a standing ovation from his congregation Sunday after admitting to his abuse of a child.\n\nAndy Savage admitted to his flock that he had engaged in a \u201csexual incident\u201d with a teenage girl he drove home from church 20 years ago. He was a youth minister at a church in suburban Houston at the time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\n[Savage] did not tell the congregation at Highpoint Church what took place in 1998, but he said that he had sinned, taken responsibility for it and never kept it a secret from church leaders. He said that before [his accuser] took her story public, he believed that the episode had been \u201cdealt with in Texas.\u201d \u201cUntil now, I did not know there was unfinished business with Jules,\u201d Mr. Savage, 42, said during the service, which was streamed live online. \u201cJules, I am deeply sorry for my actions 20 years ago. I remain committed to cooperate with you toward forgiveness and healing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Savage didn\u2019t come forward with his \u201csin\u201d of his own volition. His accuser, Jules Woodson, went public just days before, writing a blog post that detailed his assault against her.\n\nIn the blog, which highlights sexual abuse within the church, Woodson says that Savage offered to take her home from church, where she had gone after school. Instead of dropping her off at her house, though, Savage drove past to a secluded area and had Woodson perform oral sex on him. Later, she says, Savage got out of the car and went to her passenger-side door, getting on his knees and begging her not to tell anyone what happened.\n\nAccording to Woodson, the man of Gold told her, \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone, Jules, please. You have to take this to the grave with you.\u201d She was 17 years old at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodson says that she reached out to Savage following news of Matt Lauer\u2019s firing from NBC for sexual abuse, asking him in an email if he remembered that night, and the sexual assault that took place.\n\nSavage never responded to her. After a month of no reply, reports the Times, Woodson decided that it was time to go public with her story.\n\nWoodson also told the Times that she had reported the incident to an associate pastor at the church back in \u201998. Instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Woodson says that Larry Cotton, a pastor at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church, advised her to stay quiet and said that the church would address the issue itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAfter Ms. Woodson told Mr. Cotton about her story in 1998, she said the church sent Mr. Savage to apologize to her mother. But he never told her mother explicitly what had happened, leaving the impression that they had only kissed. In Sunday\u2019s service, Mr. Savage said that at the time he handled the situation in a \u201cbiblical way\u201d and resigned from the church and returned to his hometown, Memphis.\ufeff\n\nWhere, as we know, Savage simply went on to another church.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d like to know specifically what \u201cbiblical way\u201d Savage took to address this situation. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t wandering in the desert for 40 years. And I must have missed the part in the Bible where a man of God takes advantage of a teenage girl, gets called out on his behavior and then just bounces to another, bigger church where he receives a 20-second standing ovation for admitting he abused his power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe that\u2019s in Deuteronomy, or maybe Jesus only wanted teenage girls in dark, secluded places to touch the hem of his garment.\n\nEither way, Highpoint Church says it\u2019s standing by its man.\n\nRead more at WTDV-TV and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["pastor", "savage", "sexual", "took", "mr", "church", "sexually", "admitted", "told", "collins", "leave", "woodson", "teen", "jules", "assaulting"], "polarity": 0.09166528925619834, "subjectivity": 0.44981031090121987},

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

She thinks that she\u2019s going to walk in and find me hanging from the ceiling, my neck stuffed into one of her good bedsheets, so she has taken me to the man she believes can bring me away from the darkness, off the devil music and back to the boy I never was, but the one she wants me to be.\n\n\u201cArthur, either you are outside in the next 10 minutes or I\u2019m sending you to stay with your father.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father is a zombie who lives in a small apartment in S.E. that isn\u2019t close to anything but drugs and a gas station that sells everything he needs to do drugs. I went to see him when he first got the apartment, right after the divorce, and I stayed up all night looking out the bedroom window onto MLK Ave. That night I watched a woman give a man a blow job behind a school and saw two kids, no older than me, beat an African taxicab driver to his knees for no reason. Once my mother realized that my dad, who had lost his job, only had his apartment because he let the drug dealers sell their drugs out of it\u2014which meant that they paid his rent and he got free drugs\u2014she stopped sending me there. From then on he became a drugged-out Aesop\u2019s fable, a stoned John Henry (if the hammer was a crack pipe) or all starving African children.\n\nDidn\u2019t do your homework!

You can go live with your father where that nigga doesn\u2019t even have plates!\n\nNormally I treat her stories like stories, just words without meaning unless I put them there, but this morning, something in her voice tells me she is tired. Maybe it\u2019s the absence of yelling that usually accompanies her threats, or maybe it\u2019s that she said my full name, which always carried trouble and consequence. Either way we both know that whether I was or wasn\u2019t trying to kill myself, sending me to live with the person who isn\u2019t living means that I stop living, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI walk to the car, groggy-eyed, open the door soft, fall into the chilly leather seat and slam the door hard. My mother slaps the back of my head, but I already felt it coming, so it didn\u2019t sting. She makes a left onto North Capitol, a right on Bryant, crosses First, and parks.\n\n\u201cWe could have walked here,\u201d I say.\n\nMy mother scrunches her face, and I notice that she is in full war paint: Eyes, lips and cheeks are all colored. Her light-brown hair is curled tight to her head. I also know that the reason we didn\u2019t walk the three-and-a-half blocks is that I embarrass my mother. My hair is pink. My girlfriend\u2014well, ex-girlfriend\u2014Dolphin dyed it pink right before we broke up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a foot taller than my mother and thin as a whisper. My T-shirt barely comes to my waist; my jeans look painted on, they\u2019re so tight, but I haven\u2019t broken them in yet, which is the only reason I wore them outside; they taper down to my platform black-and-white check Tuks. They\u2019re hard to find, but I got them at an old thrift shop in upper NW. I\u2019d like to think they were Ian MacKaye\u2019s old shoes, ones that he wrecked and ravaged playing night after night in some seedy basement that I was now lucky enough to wear. Of course the soles are coming apart and the once nubby black suede has turned into a washed-out gray, the laces look chewed, and these say that I have been somewhere and seen more than my age.\n\nMy belt is leather, thick, and has stick figure fish skeletons across it in white. My skin is my mother\u2019s\u2014brown like cooked chicken just set on the napkin to rest\u2014but my eyes are wild and my thick, nappy hair says that I am Zombie\u2019s son. I look down at my wrinkled white shirt and feel the shame that being me brings. I get out and shut the door softly.\n\nThe man who is to save me is short, broad and wearing a navy blue suit with thick pinstripes that look like they were drawn with chalk. The shoulders of said suit stick out wider than his shoulders and make his jacket look draped on and too big for his body. His skin and shoes are shiny brown, and his black-and-gray hair is cut tight to his head like a cigarette-ash skullcap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHey, Jesus,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cOh, I am not Jesus, son,\u201d he says. He smiles at my mother and turns back to me. \u201cI\u2019m not a pastor, either. I\u2019m a man of God, though, and your mother\u2019s worried. Consider me like a brother. Lot of folks \u2019round here call me Brother Krall.\u201d\n\nHe holds out his hand for me to shake it and smiles harder this time so my mother can see his teeth. For the most part, the tops of his choppers are whitelike, but his bottoms are dirty snow. He has one top tooth on the right side way near the back of his mouth that is framed in gold. Not a gold tooth\u2014he literally has a thin string of gold lining one of his back teeth. I smack the palm of his hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNice tooth, Jesus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNice church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start. I consider it a spirit house.\u201d\n\nWhere was God when Porch beat the piss out of me until I yelled that I was a faggot? Where was God when Blue took a piss on Mongoose with the mag spokes? Until we clear this up, God and I aren\u2019t really on speaking terms, but I see now why my mother has brought me to this place, and it isn\u2019t so much for my salvation as it is to feed her loneliness. My mother likes Jesus, and I\u2019m her excuse and her explanation. I don\u2019t even have to say anything, as my looks are enough to explain why she needs saving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer Barney-purple knit sweater is too tight and cut too low for the room, which is nothing but old people in the basement of K.C. Lewis Elementary. There are chairs that don\u2019t match. Some are blue, some are red and some look like urine. Jesus is talking to my mom, who keeps laughing and leaning forward, and every time she does, a little more of her hidden skin, skin that is only meant for the bathroom mirror, shows, and Jesus just keeps smiling and there is that tooth, that one way in the back that\u2019s lined in gold that is telling me that his first joke is to get her to laugh and then bend a bit, while the real trick is to peek down the front of her sweater. And my mother, the woman who less than an hour ago was calling me all kinds of ungodly names, keeps touching Jesus\u2019 hand and bending forward, and at this point, her V-neck sweater might as well be a U-neck.\n\nThese two old people flirting makes me want to rinse my eyeballs in bleach, so I stop watching my mother and Jesus and look around the room and see a laminated children\u2019s food pyramid with a cartoon white girl standing holding a half-eaten apple. Old food and juice stain the cement walls that aren\u2019t covered with tiles. There can\u2019t be more than 15 people here, who stand in the back eating doughnuts off a tilted conference table whose tablecloth is about as tight as my mother\u2019s sweater.\n\n\u201cMa, you want a doughnut?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt, don\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus knows about patience. Don\u2019t you, Jesus?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says.\n\nI ignore Jesus and walk over to the table and see that all the old people have totally killed the doughnuts. The face of the skinny guy crowding the doughnuts is plain, brown. His skin is smooth and he smells like wet wood. His tan leather jacket was probably cooler when Malcolm X was alive, since the collar is fat like butterfly wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo more glazed, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kidding? That\u2019s all I come here for.\u201d\n\nHe knows that I know there aren\u2019t any more glaze because I can see he\u2019s holding three stacked doughnuts in a golden glaze tower on a napkin that is wet with sugar. He is eating one, which means, by my count, he has had at least four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI look at his stack and then up at him, and he shoves the last bit of brown honey goodness into his mouth and starts on his next one. He looks back at me, scrunches his face, and I know that trying to get a doughnut from this old man would be like trying to get my mom to get off my back.\n\nI look over to the table: six plain doughnuts. I grab one, lick it and rub the licked side in the box that once held the glazed.\n\nJesus speaks.\n\n\u201cEveryone, if you want to find a chair, we can go head and get started.\u201d\n\nMy mother waves me off the table, and before I leave, I double-dip back in the glaze and shove the rest in my mouth. I can barely taste anything but thick cake dough. My mother is up front at attention, with her back straight and her chest out, and I wish I didn\u2019t have to be here to see this, her and Jesus all coy and stupid. The old people move like fat cows looking for new grass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sit way in the back and stretch my legs out straight when my mother looks at me and coughs once, strong, which is to tell me to \u201cget up here.\u201d I act like I don\u2019t understand. I point to my throat. Then I mime drinking a cup of water and lay my palm flat as if it is holding a tray, and then mime the drinking-water part again. She curls her top lip and snarls \u201cGet up here\u201d in a language that is an inch above a bark.\n\nJesus is waiting for me. He literally has his hands clasped tight in front of him like a prayer, and I can see he has a pinkie ring with a red stone in it. When I stand, I see that there isn\u2019t a seat for me near my mother, so I snatch a urine-colored seat on my way up and drag the legs against the cold fake-marble floor, and the noise, the steady claw of the metal legs against the ground, is upsetting everyone.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pick that chair up,\u201d my mother says, and I do.\n\nWhen I get to the front, my mother grabs my arm and squeezes, and I can feel her nails digging into my skin. I don\u2019t even care at this point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Krall,\u201d she says to Jesus.\n\nHe moves the pinkie-ring hand towards my mother like he\u2019s shooing her apology away.\n\nThen Jesus speaks again.\n\n\u201cFor those of y\u2019all that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m Brother Krall and I\u2019d like to welcome y\u2019all to the Bryant Street Spirit House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOr a fucking lunchroom,\u201d I mumble. My mother squeezes my arm again.\n\n\u201cCome on up here, Diane, as this works better with a partner.\u201d\n\nMy mother lets my arm go. I look down and see that her nails have left little marks in my skin. I rub where her nails once were and I can feel the divots. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but I rub it like it does. My mother ignores me as she stands up smiling like that fat white guy just called her out of the audience to play The Price Is Right. I want to vomit. She turns and puts her purse in her seat and pushes the sleeves up on her titty sweater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is ready for Jesus.\n\n\u201cNow, you stand right there,\u201d he says to her, and places her so that she has her back to him. She stands there giggling and peeking over her shoulder and looking back at the old folks as if she is really worried.\n\nThen Jesus says: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t make cars or know how to fix them, but let\u2019s say that Diane is a car. What kind of car are you, Diane?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fast car,\u201d my mother answers and then laughs and puts her face in her hands like she is embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, all cool and stupid. \u201cA fast car works.\u201d\n\nShe is flirting with Jesus, and I can feel little bits of dry dough in the middle of my throat starting to work themselves back up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, today, Diane, your fast car is stuck. The way the Spirit House works is, I\u2019m like a tow truck for God, and if you\u2019re stuck \u2026 \u201d\n\nHe walks towards my mother\u2019s backside, and he puts his hands around my mother\u2019s waist. \u201cI can pull you out,\u201d he says, and drags the word \u201cpull\u201d long and slow like an endless chain while he slowly brings my mother into him. My mother makes this \u201cWhy I never,\u201d old-antebellum-mint-julep face while Jesus stands there with my mother\u2019s butt pressed up against his dick. My mother leans her head back.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get unstuck?!\u201d he yells out from his stomach.\n\nAnd the old people all hopped up on glazed sugar start screaming back.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\n\n\u201cMove me, Lord!\u201d\n\nJesus smiles hard, and I can see that one tooth that is way in the back that is lined in gold, and the old people all hopped up on glazed doughnuts start laughing and yelling, and that thinly lined gold tooth almost winks at me. It almost says I don\u2019t know God; it almost says I\u2019m going to be in your house at ungodly hours in a wifebeater, boxers and dress socks; it almost says Go head and kill yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s embarrassing who now?\u201d I say when my mother gets back to her seat.\n\n\u201cA boy with pink hair can\u2019t tell me nothing about embarrassing anyone,\u201d she says.\n\nI wish I had worn the T-shirt I wanted to wear. It said, \u201cFishbone: Still Stuck in Your Throat,\u201d which highlighted the group\u2019s seminal classic \u201cLet Dem Hoes Fight,\u201d but my mother told me to take it off. So I switched it to a plain white Hanes undershirt in protest of my mother\u2019s ignorance about the best black punk band ever. I tried to explain to my mother that her insistence on sending me out of Stronghold and way off to St. Albans private school is what made me like this. I was never going to like the boys in Stronghold, loud and gangsta, and once I got to St. Albans, I knew I would never wear polo shirts and Sperrys. I was rebellious and confusing, a black kid who found refuge in punks. In hard core, in double bass drums, in power chords; in loud, sweaty concerts where blood and bruises were a badge of honor; in the glory of piercings and tattoos\u2014a visible fuck-you to anyone who didn\u2019t understand; in everything everyone else found disgust in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it was the dual shame I was attracted to, to be black and punk\u2014to be hated and denigrated in either world, to know that those who did understand were the only people for me. I tried to explain to her that punk culture was close to the radical \u201960s and all the shit that she glorified, wearing Afros and Panther buttons. What she wanted was an educated, conscious son who didn\u2019t end his sentences with prepositions; what she got was something way left for her, and at this point I think she would just rather me be gay. At least we could gossip.\n\n\n\nMy breakup with Dolphin led me here, to this lunchroom on this day with my mother, and I am wondering how any of this is supposed to make me better. I had already gone through the three phases of black crisis intervention: The first proved fruitless, since I am almost a foot taller than my mother and have her by at least 80 pounds, so when she threatened to beat the shit out of me, it did nothing.\n\nThe second phase didn\u2019t do anything, since I stopped caring what the family thought of me around the time I got my first pair of Docs and started listening to German punk. To her, shame was still an effective way of crisis management. So when she called everyone and told them that I was losing my grip since the breakup, I was already laying in the bed blasting Fishbone into my headphones and reading Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition out loud. And even with all the noise going, I could still hear my mother\u2014who was walking back and forth in front of my room\u2014saying to a person I believed was my Aunt Beatrice, \u201cThat boy is into that white stuff, and now he\u2019s all cut up over some white girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI kept yelling:\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nPart of her story was true: My breakup with Dolphin was tragic. It came after we\u2019d gone down to the Library of Congress to see a Baldwin retrospective, and I casually mentioned how I thought that being gay and dealing with his sexuality first allowed someone like Baldwin to really free himself into his work. She claimed that somehow I was being insensitive to the plight of the gays. I told her that wasn\u2019t the case. More was said. Mostly her talk-shouting about how could I be such an insensitive asshole. I didn\u2019t get it. She told me we were over. I really didn\u2019t get it. Days later, after hours of research on homosexuality and the Harlem Renaissance to help make my point, she stopped me before I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cArtie. This is so constricted. The whole fallacy of hetero relations and the conformity of the male-female domination is just \u2026 I don\u2019t know ... lame. Like your paying for the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any fucking money!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m saying, Artie; your temper, the structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomasine. You. can\u2019t. do. this. To. Me. To. Us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Dolphin.\u201d\n\nD-i-a-l-t-o-n-e.\n\nI threw the phone into the kitchen wall and it shattered into pieces.\n\nI got into my dark Levi\u2019s and my Fishbone Give a Monkey a Brain and He\u2019ll Swear He\u2019s the Center of the Universe T-shirt because I felt like if I was going to be the part, I might as well dress the part. I opened a bottle of Jack that I had under my bed and played Fishbone\u2019s \u201cServitude\u201d on repeat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got drunk faster than I thought I would, and by the fifth time the song came around, Angelo Moore kept yelling at me in his South Central falsetto:\n\nGod\u2019s not with you \u2026 holy roller \u2026 your heart dwells in hell.\n\nI raged. I launched myself into the walls of my room like I was in a mosh pit. I cut my shoulder on the door and the blood soaked through my shirt slow. I don\u2019t remember the cuts on my face or hands, as I was numb. I remember bleeding. I remember bending over to catch my breath, and then I remember the room shifting sideways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI threw myself around my room and shattered into pieces. My mother found me unconscious in the room with blood all over the carpet.\n\nThis is where the legend of my killing myself began.\n\nShe told me she was going to beat the shit out of me if I couldn\u2019t pull it together.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet some white girl run you down like that.\u201d\n\nMy mother was embarrassed when I started dating Dolphin. She thought it was a physical manifestation of my hate for her. None of that was true, but that\u2019s the way she would phrase it to her sisters, or the hen house, as Zombie called them when they got to squawking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Mom; I just love Dolphin.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dolphin.\u2019 You hear that, Bea? The bitch named after a fish.\u201d\n\nShe was naming herself after a freedom that she thought only came to animals left in the wild. She was trying to reclaim a part of her that felt confined by societal standards. She didn\u2019t like her birth name or even the idea of birth names, as she believed that naming someone was akin to ownership, and I explained all of this to my mom and told her that Thomasine calling herself Dolphin was no different then when blacks started changing to Muslim names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPlease stop comparing that little white girl to what we went through \u2026 \u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help the day my mother pulled up in her tiny gray Nissan Sentra and I was on the porch with Dolphin, who\u2019d just started letting her hair dread. We had already had sex in the house, but we knew to move it to the porch, as my mother didn\u2019t like it when we were home without her supervision, which meant me and Dolphin sitting in the living room while my mother watched TV in the kitchen. So by moving to the porch, we let her believe that we were sexless. My mother, who had just gotten off work, was saying something about getting something out of the back seat of the car when she saw Dolphin\u2019s thick blond dread in the front of her face.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked Dolphin.\n\nAnd Dolphin didn\u2019t get it. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was burning a hole through the top of her thick, dirty-blond hair. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was working over all of the black things stolen by whites. She didn\u2019t see that my mother was seething with a kind of hatred that only comes from realizing that you have been betrayed, because to Dolphin, she hadn\u2019t done anything to my mother. She hadn\u2019t stolen anything, beaten anything, taken anything from her. She sat there looking for something on her Chocolate Genius GodMusic T-shirt that said I was just in your house, in your son\u2019s room, in positions that only gymnast or acrobats should perform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need me to get something out of the car?\u201d I said, shuffling down the walkway towards Adams.\n\nMy mother, carrying her empty green mesh lunch bag from work in one hand and an elbow full of ungraded school papers, just looked down on Dolphin the way a slave owner looked down a slave deciding whether or not he should sell him. I could feel Dolphin looking out at me for safety, some kind of line that would bring her back to shore. But I had nothing for her, no net, no rope and no words to throw overboard.\n\nI looked at my mother in her blue school dress and red belt that came across her waist like the equator and then at Dolphin, so thin and pale in dusty cutoff Dickies and dirty red Chucks with no laces. The two women who would be the closest to my core, both oceans away. I looked down at the top of my red Dr. Martens that weren\u2019t scuffed enough to look believable, my boots that showed no signs of revolution, still carried the out-of-box shininess that showed my face to look just like what I was: sheltered. It was then that I realized that the truth didn\u2019t really live with Dolphin and me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back on it, this was probably the first root that broke through the pavement because no matter how much I loved pulling and kissing and tugging Dolphin\u2019s flesh, I just couldn\u2019t cross my mother. So Dolphin broke first. She looked away from me and down at her hands and then at her feet and then into the ground and off into a distance where my mother hadn\u2019t come home. And my mother let her off the hook and took her papers, her lunch bag and the last remnants of her Afro, the tiny hairs that she couldn\u2019t curl that rested on the bottom part of her neck, way lower than the de-revolutionized permed and pressed-out part that covered it, and pulled the screen door and walked into the kitchen. I stuck my hands in the front of my jeans and frowned my face the way that only wordlessness can leave jaws tight, and walked back from the car and sat next to Dolphin, who started crying.\n\n\u201cWhy does your mother hate me?\u201d\n\n\u2026 sujeta en mis brazos como un pez infinitamente pegado a mi alma r\u00e1pido y lento en la energia subceleste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is what I should\u2019ve said. I should have pulled on the only quote that I memorized from the Spanish version of Neruda poems that she gave me and that I struggled through that night with her on the phone and she giggled and said \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time.\n\nBut what I said in that moment when she needed me most, in that moment when my mother just walked in and crushed us back to babies, in that moment when I realized just how small we both were\u2014in that moment, all I could muster was, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t hate you; she just loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallelujah!\u201d A fat black woman yells who is too big to praise dance, so she just wiggles and holds her hand above her head, waving Jesus away.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is in full bloom, Jesus. He has a blue washcloth in his hand like dead roses, and every now and again he pats his forehead with it. He lost the jacket about six amens in, and his white shirt is now loose and wrinkled around his waist. When the sun comes in through the square-cut window in the lunchroom door and hits that back tooth that I feel like only I can see, it make his face shine. The slight glow off the thin lining that rounds that tooth like old piecrust is whispering in a language that only I can hear. I feel like it\u2019s asking, \u201cWhy do pastors and pimps dress alike?\u201d I feel like I hear, \u201cI can help you get closer to God.\u201d I turn to my mother to see if she is there with me when I hear, \u201cThese people aren\u2019t your friends.\u201d\n\nMy mother grabs my hand and holds it up to the air, and I snatch it down and ask her what she is doing. I never like when my mother forces my body to do stuff, as I have never been a fan of being pushed around.\n\n\u201cYou better put your hand back up in the air,\u201d she says.\n\nI can tell by the way the ends of her eyebrows are pointing down and inward towards her nose that I need to get it back up, so I do. Turns out, Jesus asked all the people who love God to put a hand in the air. And then he walks over to the doughnut table and snatches one of the empty doughnut baskets off the table so fast that the napkins and powder both fly from the basket and land perfectly on the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI told you we\u2019re small,\u201d he says as he hands the basket to a woman in the back of the cafeteria. \u201cJust remember when we are way out in one of those big ole churches out in Bowie and all of y\u2019all are elders, we can laugh about how we had to use the doughnut basket for the bread basket! Can I get an amen!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d\n\nThe doughnut basket makes it past me, and Mom puts in $5 for the both of us. I hear women in the back say that it was a lovely service as they gather their purses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cNext Sunday is couples counseling, so come back here with your boyfriend and girlfriends and I can show you how to get that train back on track.\u201d\n\nThe old men and women laugh, mostly at the idea that any of them have girlfriends or boyfriends, and it dawns on me that in my newfound singledom, I, too, am a part of this joke. My mother looks over at Jesus, giving him the nod, and then tells me that she will be in the car while I talk to him. He stands by the door shaking the hands of the old women leaving, who have a little bit of the gospel in their step now. When the last woman leaves, he shuts the cafeteria door and the sun stops leaking into the small window.\n\n\u201cCome on and let\u2019s talk back here,\u201d he says as he snatches his blazer and the doughnut basket off one of the seats. The room that he takes me to is right off the church, and I can tell from the red kick balls, movable balance beams, jump ropes and tennis rackets that this is gym storage. A desk sits near the back, and Jesus walks over and plops himself down in a wooden chair that doesn\u2019t flinch at his weight, and I grab a chair and put it across from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he says. \u201cPussy or money?\u201d\n\nI am thrown off by the word \u201cpussy\u201d\u2014not that I don\u2019t use it, but it feels strange coming out of Jesus\u2019 mouth, even with the tooth. I tilt my head like a dog that can\u2019t figure out if what his owner is holding is really a bone.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, man, you heard me; pussy or money?\u201d\n\nThe choice hangs between us, steaming like fresh-cooked pot roast with no knife.\n\nJesus speaks. \u201cThe way I see it, there\u2019re only two reasons a man would kill himself: pussy or not having no money. You too young to know what being broke really feels like, so it must be pussy.

Slightly defeated.\n\n\u201cBecause no man would dye his hair pink unless some nice pair of legs told him it would look cute. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesus dumps the coins out of the basket and starts counting. He isn\u2019t looking at me because he knows he\u2019s right. The day we went to get the dye, I wanted something less radical, maybe blond or a soft green, but Dolphin picked out the box of pink with purpose and told me that this was it, and like a heroin addict I was all in.\n\n\u201c$11.34!\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThat barely covers the cost of the doughnuts. I should play that number.\u201d He reaches over and grabs a small slip of paper and a pen, and I assume he writes down 1-1-3-4.\n\n\u201cYou gamble?\u201d I say, which even catches me off guard, considering that he has been talking to me about pussy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d He says. \u201cLife is a gamble and if someone has to win, why not Brother Krall?! You got to walk before you Krall.\u201d And Jesus laughs, and I don\u2019t get any of it.\n\n\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you think those old folks that came to see me today, how you think they feel now?\u201d\n\nThis felt like a trick.

I'm going to need them to stop acting like teenagers whose feelings get hurt on Twitter. I'm going to need them to log off and do their jobs.\n\nTo date, the president-elect and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff investigating a murder on a national stage can't stop talking or tweeting about their feelings. Donald Trump's history of being thin-skinned is well documented, but on Tuesday, Sheriff Newell Normand continued his string of odd behavior since the shooting death of former running NFL back Joe McKnight.\n\nAccording to reports, McKnight and Ronald Gasser, 54 were engaged in some sort of road rage incident that left McKnight dead at the end of Gasser's gun. Gasser waited for police to arrive on the scene, handed over his weapon and was handcuffed and arrested. Where things took a really strange turn was at some point that night, Normand released Gasser and then held a press conference in which he defended not only his decision to release him, but the shooter.\n\n\"Mr. Gasser isn't going anywhere,\" Normand said.\n\nIn learning that Gasser may have become a target of violence, a police cruiser was reportedly ordered to sit outside of Gasser's home. That's right, the police were protecting the killer while he sat in his own home less than 24 hours after the killing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, news stations learned that Gasser had been arrested and charged with manslaughter, not because the police released the information, but because reporters found that Gasser had been booked into the jail's public system. Later Tuesday, Normand held another bizarre press conference in which he read emails that people have sent to public officials since Gasser's release.\n\n\"You punk ass Uncle Tom coon, we saw you sell out to them you rat ass faggot punk,\" Gasser read. \"You ass kissing fa\u2014ot that has done little to our community. All we know is that you are a b\u2014ch puppet, you rat a\u2014 looking coon on TV; I bet they made you say that puppet boy, I know what I see, I know that Normand is a piece of sh-t and you stood behind that white boy with that bulls\u2014t, nig\u2014. You won't even stand with your people you self serving son of a b\u2014ch.\"\n\nLet me bring you back up to speed: road rage, 54-year-old white man shoots and kills ex-NFL running back. All the public wants is justice that looks like justice in the form of justice. That if the man who shot and killed someone is arrested, that he be put in jail, have a bail set and then a trial. What the people who want justice have gotten is the release of said killer and two lectures from the man who's supposed to be a catalyst for justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as the email, I call bulls\u2014t. I know the language was supposed to imply that the letter was written by a black person, in fact when the sheriff was asked why he felt it important to read the letter he devolved into another lecture about black on black crime, but I don't think any black person wrote that. I'm not saying it wasn't sent to an official, but I am saying that I don't think a black person sent it. The flow is off. We don't triple down on our slurs that way. There is a rhythm to our language and this sounds choppy and forced. I'm not saying that the sheriff wrote the note himself and then walked out there to make himself and his colleagues the victim of a murder investigation. I'm saying that it was mad bizarre for the sheriff to read that letter at that time if he wasn't trying to make himself the center of a murder investigation.\n\nTwice now, the public has been chastised for wanting a killer to be brought to justice by the sheriff handling the investigation. Twice now, this oddball, who keeps acting as if hurtful words are stopping him from doing his job, has lectured the public.\n\nThis is the Trumpian effect. Leaders no longer have to be above the fray, they are in the fray. And there appears to be a certain joy that a group of Trump voters feel in being openly racist. If the president can hate freely on Twitter then why can't a small backwoods sheriff turn a murder investigation press conference into a national dressing down. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has called for justice for McKnight. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has talked about making everyone in the community feel safe. So far we have two times where the sheriff has gotten into his feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, I can only give this dumba\u2014 sherrif and the dumba\u2014 president-elect a word of advice, we don't need your lectures or your leadership, but we do need you to do your job.\n\nAnd if being on Twitter or email is too difficult for your little fragile feelings then log the f\u2014k off.", "keywords": ["saying", "say", "real", "justice", "public", "normand", "read", "la", "nigga", "black", "im", "happy", "gasser", "need", "sheriff"], "polarity": -0.02292843691148776, "subjectivity": 0.3483319881624966},

According to multiple outlets, an \u201calternative religious group\u201d in Cumberland County, N.C., has been forcing children as young as 9 to work full time at the group\u2019s fish markets to help fund the organization\u2019s operations.\n\nThe children were residents of the McCollum Ranch, a communal property owned and operated by John C. McCollum, a minister. He also ran four separate \u201cJohn C\u2019s Fish Markets\u201d and mobile grills around Fayetteville and Lumberton in North Carolina.\n\n\n\nThe Fayetteville Observer reports that McCollum referred to himself as the \u201cchief apostle\u201d at the ranch, and authorities allege that McCollum would threaten the children with physical violence or deny them food if they refused to work.\n\nA release from the Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office, reported by the Raleigh News and Observer, details the children\u2019s alleged treatment:\n\nThe children had to work full time in the fish markets with little to no compensation. The children are performing labor such as lifting heavy boxes/shipments (reportedly some weighing approximately 50 lbs), keeping fish iced, cutting fish and cleaning; additionally, many of the children were performing construction and maintenance on the mobile grills after fish market hours. The former residents also informed investigators that the children were not attending school and were being denied adequate education and care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice have been investigating the ranch since last year after a 15-year-old boy escaped from the compound in March, the News and Observer reports. Several of the children\u2019s mothers were managers at the fish markets, and authorities say they believe that some of the children may be second-generation victims of McCollum.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, officers say they discovered that one of the compound\u2019s residents, Brenda Joyce Hall, had been running a fake institution, Knowledge Home School. Using the names of various McCollum Ranch residents, Hall used the school to produce fake high school transcripts and enroll the ranch\u2019s residents in online programs at local community colleges. As the News and Observer reports, \u201cThe records were then used to secure financial aid that was used by the criminal operation at McCollum Ranch.\u201d\n\nLt. Sean Swain, a public information officer for the Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office, says that the department has investigated McCollum at least four times before. McCollum has also pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse before: In 1990, McCollum was charged with beating children with an automotive fan so badly that it left scars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWRAL-TV and other outlets also report that McCollum was a traveling minister, hosting tent revivals throughout North Carolina and other states. Police believe it was through those tent revivals that McCollum, who has been preaching since the \u201980s, recruited people to live on his ranch. Police have so far found 120 people, not including children, who lived at the ranch over the years.\n\nAs of Wednesday, McCollum was still at the Cumberland County Jail, being held on $1.1. million bond.", "keywords": ["residents", "ranch", "religious", "run", "bust", "slave", "mccollum", "north", "markets", "child", "labor", "group", "observer", "school", "fish", "children", "using", "cumberland"], "polarity": -0.060731658692185005, "subjectivity": 0.41358395989974933},

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her.

I doubt she gave much of a damn about the grade of barbecue sauce purchased with the tray of boneless chicken wings or the fancy new Pack 'n Play her grandmother bought her. And I know she gave no fucks about the party's superhero motif, because the first thing she did when seeing the bedazzled Batman shirt I wore was attempt to eat the bat.\n\nI'm not much of a party person myself, but I looked forward to this day just to be able to witness her experiencing it. Her face when opening and playing with her gifts. (Which, as usual for her, landed somewhere between slightly bemused and slightly annoyed. My daughter is British, apparently.) Her eyes when she heard the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song sung to her for the first time. Her tiny legs as she walked from the cake stand to the couch her cousin was sitting on. And those same tiny legs an hour later when she apparently forgot she actually knows how to walk now and just started crawling everywhere.\n\nShe is my Feminist Octopus \u2014 a name I\u2019ve given her because her favorite words currently are \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d And also because she\u2019s so damn curious and engaged with her surroundings that it\u2019s like she had eight limbs; all simultaneously grabbing and touching and pulling and pinching. I know it\u2019s not the most creative nickname, but I\u2019m her dad and I\u2019m allowed to be corny.\n\nOur house right now is an emporium of random baby shit shoehorned into an adult living space. It's like someone went to Babies R Us, emptied 20 shelves into 50 different bags, drove to IKEA, and arbitrarily sprinkled the bags' content throughout the store; a GRACO easy fold highchair parked adjacent to the living room mantle and both the fireplace underneath it and the 65 inch Sony 4K Ultra HD TV on top of it; Chicka Chicka Boom Boom laying on a SV\u00c4RTAN limited edition collection tray table. When babies arrive to couples who've never had children before, their presence is a colonization. A welcome colonization of course. A colonization with footies and frequent viewings of Sesame Street on YouTube (in Spanish though because we want her to learn that too). But a colonization nonetheless. Your resources are devoted to them, your thoughts possessed with them, your instincts stirred by them.\n\nAnd its with this context that killings such as the killing of Joe McKnight are so fucking brutal. So fucking complete. Not necessarily to me. I, like many others who heard of the circumstances surrounding his death, felt an appropriate amount of outrage, sadness, and perplexity. But I wasn't devastated by it the same way the grandmother who rented the space for his first birthday party 27 years ago, the uncle who first taught him out to catch a football, and the mom and the dad who had their lives upended and colonized by him 28 years are most definitely today. I can't conjure many fates more cruel than to have a life that was treasured, prayed over, sacrificed for, led, and loved snatched away so senselessly. And for everyone \u2014 including the police \u2014 to know exactly who did it. And for that person to be free. As if those decades of memories and moments and gallons of formula and refilled diaper genies and doctors' office visits and Polaroids of first steps meant nothing. Like none of that mattered. Like it didn't even happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts no secret that the undervaluing of Black lives isn't as much about a conscious and seething racial animus but more the inability to regard us as fully human; a dynamic that manifests as a reluctance to give our capacity to hurt, bleed, double over in pain, and die any benefit of the doubt. Its not that our lives and the diversity of life within each of our lives don't matter at all. They just don't matter as much. And for Black men and Black women as strong and sturdy and brown as Joe McKnight was, this modicum of empathy becomes nonexistent. He's been \"grown\" his entire life; a \"man\" since before he could ride a bike; a threat since before he could spell. Perhaps Ronald Gasser will eventually be arrested, charged, and convicted of his murder. But his freedom today \u2014 that he's receiving a consideration, a benefit of the doubt, that Joe McKnight did not, could not, and would never have \u2014 synopsizes America's feelings about men and women like the one he killed and the broken and brutalized families they leave behind; communicating to them and to us that those birthday parties didn't matter.

Franklin, who directly confronted America\u2019s racist history and helped shaped the discourse around America\u2019s legacy of slavery. The stretch of road was dedicated to the influential scholar Monday afternoon at the Hayti Heritage Center.\n\n\n\nAs the Raleigh News and Observer notes, Franklin\u2019s name on a Southern roadway, which will now be called Dr. John H. Franklin Highway, is significant, particularly in North Carolina. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when visitors and residents entering the Tar Heel State were confronted with a welcome sign from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this www.newsobserver.com embed.\n\nFranklin, who died in 2009, was described by fellow historian Nell Irvin Painter as \u201cthe first great American historian to reckon the price [America] owed in violence, autocracy and militarism.\u201d\n\nFranklin meticulously documented African-American history. In 1947 he published From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African-Americans, described in his New York Times obituary as \u201cone of the definitive historical surveys of the American black experience\u201d and by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel as \u201ca landmark in the interpretation of American civilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Duke University professor was among the first American scholars to confront the hypocrisy of America\u2019s ideals against its history of white supremacy. In one of his final works, a 2007 article for the Atlantic Monthly, Franklin wrote that \u201cif the American idea was to fight every war from the beginning of colonization to the middle of the 20th century with Jim Crow armed forces, in the belief that this would promote the American idea of justice and equality, then the American idea was an unmitigated disaster and a denial of the very principles that this country claimed as its rightful heritage.\u201d\n\nAs the Times wrote, Franklin earned many \u201cfirsts\u201d throughout his storied career. He was the first black president of the American Historical Association and the first black person to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association, which was segregated at the time (the group later elected him as its president). He was also the first black professor to serve as department chair in a majority-white institution (Brooklyn College).\n\nFranklin also applied his gifts as a scholar to the fight for civil rights, working on Thurgood Marshall\u2019s legal team in the Brown v. Board of Education case, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down \u201cseparate but equal\u201d schooling in 1954. For his contributions, Franklin received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from Bill Clinton in 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFranklin was originally from Oklahoma, but North Carolina became his adopted home state.\n\n\u201cDurham and the entire state of North Carolina were blessed to become his home,\u201d North Carolina Gov.

At least that\u2019s what the Montgomery County, N.C., decided after a group of local firefighters refused to remove a Confederate flag from fire station property.\n\nAccording to 11 Alive, the Uwharrie Volunteer Fire Department has been proudly flying the flag of losers and traitors for years, claiming that it represented history and heritage.\n\nMontgomery County commissioners, however, insisted that the flag was inappropriate and divisive and attempted to get the fire station to remove it.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Commissioners stated their position, that they did think the flag was inappropriate and requested for the Fire Department to take it down,\u201d Montgomery County Manager Matthew Woodard told the news station.\n\nBy Tuesday, the Board of Commissioners issued an ultimatum in writing: Remove the flag or lose full funding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would translate to $20,000 and the possibility of a new fire truck that cashes in at about $400,000. The commissioners wrote that the firefighters would only receive money for fuel and maintaining the two fire trucks that are owned by the county.\n\n\u201cThe flag is not hurting a thing,\u201d Lee Hudson, who is with the Fire Department, told the news station. \u201cWe are not a racist department. We are not in any way. Members or the department as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe Board of Commissioners had been trying to negotiate with the firefighters for months before sending the letter. Commissioners even offered to build an \u201cappropriate remembrance\u201d in place of the controversial flag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has come to represent oppression, hate and bigotry. That\u2019s why the commissioners have offered something else, an appropriate remembrance,\u201d Woodard said, according to the Courier-Tribune.\n\nHowever, firefighters refused to budge, 11 Alive notes.\n\n\u201cWe would love to work with the county and for them to support us,\u201d Hudson said, emphasizing the department\u2019s unwillingness to stand down. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to move on the issue of taking down the flag.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Board of Commissioners recognize the position they are in, the leadership responsibility they have to the county, and the obligation they have to the residents of Uwharrie,\u201d Woodard told the news station. \u201cThey have tried to find a middle ground to send the appropriate message in relations to that flag and at the same time not to jeopardize the well-being of the residents of Montgomery County.\u201d\n\nThe letter was signed by four of five commissioners, including the chair of the board. The fifth commissioner, Mike Criscoe, said that he did not sign the letter because although he did agree with removing the flag, he did not want to take away funding from the department that is needed to keep citizens\u2014and the firefighters themselves\u2014safe, according to the Courier-Tribune.\n\n\u201cI do feel like the flag, people see it as hate,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see the flag removed, but it could have been handled more diplomatically. This could have a snowball effect. If they build a new station, the volunteers probably wouldn\u2019t go along. The county may have to pay firefighters.

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest.

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty.

In fact, the Housing Authority had neglected for years to perform thousands of these evaluations.\n\nJones moved into her NYCHA apartment in the city\u2019s Bronx borough in 1999. By 2010, the Daily News reports, she had six children living with her. One of them, Dakota Taylor, who was then 4 years old, tested positive for lead contamination in her blood. At 45 micrograms per deciliter of lead in her blood, Dakota\u2019s results registered nine times higher than what is considered an \u201cacceptable\u201d level.\n\nExperts believe that high levels of lead in children can cause developmental delays, and the damage from lead poisoning cannot be reversed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones says that after the lead exposure, Dakota was held over in special ed in second grade. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have a chance to go to a regular school,\u201d Jones told the Daily News.\n\nAfter Dakota\u2019s high lead levels were detected, inspectors from New York City\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene conducted their own lead screening of Jones\u2019 apartment, the apartment of a nearby babysitter and that of her grandmother. Only the grandmother\u2019s apartment, which was not in a NYCHA development, was found free of lead paint.\n\nNYCHA, which conducts its own lead screenings on apartments, insisted that its results showed that the apartment was free of lead paint. As the Daily News notes, two earlier inspections of Jones\u2019 home in 2006 and 2008 showed that inspections had been done, but with no notation that the apartment had been checked for lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones told the paper that the findings left her feeling betrayed: \u201cI was mortified. They sent me letters every year stating that there\u2019s no lead in the apartment. Here I was thinking I was safe, taking care of my children.\u201d\n\nThe $57 million verdict against NYCHA, a decision that only took the jury an hour to reach, sends a strong mandate to the city\u2019s Housing Authority and to Mayor Bill de Blasio to address health concerns with the city\u2019s old and unsafe public housing.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones, who lives in a different public housing development now, is working toward a law degree and has emerged as a tenant leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cImagine how many other residents have gone through this,\u201d she said.\n\n", "keywords": ["nycha", "mom", "apartment", "jones", "public", "daily", "lead", "housing", "responsible", "high", "citys", "jury", "report", "york", "tests", "levels", "positive", "verdict"], "polarity": 0.09997724497724497, "subjectivity": 0.4561853958007804},

The departmental also confirmed that it will be examining its policy on texts that are allowed, as well as \u201call current lists of banned written materials.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, even though at least two prisons in the state had the book on the no-go list, the Department of Corrections noted that the book was used by the New Jersey Scholarship and Transformative Education Program, which gives inmates the opportunity to enroll in college-level courses, citing that as one of the reasons the ban was lifted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOfficials determined that the book should not have been banned, as evidenced by the fact that it is being utilized as a teaching tool for NJ-STEP students.\u201d New Jersey Department of Corrections spokesperson Matthew Schuman told the Times.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA lot of things look funny in the light, and when prisons ban a critically acclaimed book about the discrimination black people face in the criminal-justice system ... well, that\u2019s more than a little funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, according to The Guardian, that\u2019s exactly what is happening in some prisons in New Jersey, which have reportedly banned Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness .\n\nRecords obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union through a public-records request show that the book, which was published in 2010, is on lists of publications inmates in state facilities may not possess.

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

That, and Tuskegee, COINTELPRO, segregation, gentrification, piss-poor education, mass incarceration\u2014all of the \u201cshuns.\u201d\n\nAnd so when CNN reported that no fewer than six states\u2014North Dakota, North Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Texas and Rhode Island\u2014have tried to enact protections for drivers who run over protesters, many with \u201cnearly identical\u201d language, even those of us who know what time it is were taken aback by the actions of what my parents used to call \u201cthe man.\u201d\n\nPurportedly because demonstrations inconvenience real Americans with the reality of black people dying\u2014or, in the case of North Dakota and the Dakota Access Pipeline, big businesses from destroying sacred grounds\u2014these bills would offer protections for drivers who cause injury or death to protesters.\n\nMany of the bills were introduced after specific demonstrations or actions; many also contain language saying that the driver\u2019s liability hinges on whether the protesters have a permit for such demonstrations.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s where they now stand:\n\nSenate Bill 1096 was introduced in the Florida Senate in February, and a similar bill, House Bill 1419, was introduced in the Florida House in March. The language of the legislation notes that the driver must \u201cexercise due care,\u201d but if he or she maims or kills someone, the burden of proof lies with the injured person, not the driver, to prove that the driver\u2019s actions were intentional. Both bills died in subcommittees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn North Carolina, H.B. 330 excuses drivers from liability if they injure a protester who is blocking traffic. The bill was introduced in March after thousands took to the streets over the police killing of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N.C. The bill actually passed the House and is now in subcommittee before it goes to the state Senate.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s H.B. 1203 was introduced in February in response to Dakota Access Pipeline protests. According to its provisions, a driver who caused injury or death to someone blocking a roadway while \u201cexercising reasonable care\u201d would not be held liable for damages. The bill did not pass the House.\n\nIn Rhode Island, H.B. 5690, introduced in March, protected drivers who are \u201cexercising due care\u201d and who injure a protester blocking the road. If the driver \u201cpurposefully\u201d injures a protester, then he or she can be held liable, but you know that is dependent on the driver\u2019s word (and if that\u2019s anything like the police\u2019s word, you know where this is going). The bill now is \u201cunder further study,\u201d as recommended by the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Tennessee, like Florida, there were two bills introduced\u2014one in the House and one in the Senate. S.B. 944 and H.B. 668 would protect drivers from being held liable if they injure a protester who is blocking traffic in a public roadway. Again, the driver would face charges only if he or she hits the person \u201cpurposefully.\u201d The House bill failed in committee; the Senate one is currently awaiting the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nTexas introduced H.B. 250 last month. As in Florida, under this bill, drivers cannot be held liable if they were \u201cexercising due care\u201d at the time they injured a person if that person was participating in a protest. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence Committee in July but seems to have ended there.\n\nIt goes without saying that in light of the heinous death of Heather Heyer\u2014who was killed in Charlottesville, Va., by a driver who drove through a protest and, as CNN also reports, may have done so at the urging of right-wing news outlets (which later deleted the posts)\u2014these bills are particularly dangerous. They are indicative of a state that will excuse bodily harm against those who wish to exercise the rights of free speech and peaceable assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough none have so far been passed into law, it is legislation such as this that underscores the need to be vigilant about what is happening in increasingly Republican-led state legislatures and assemblies across the country. It behooves us to fight these perilous bills vigorously, or to run for office to have a seat at these tables.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["protesters", "drivers", "bills", "run", "bill", "hb", "protections", "introduced", "driver", "enact", "language", "protester", "states", "florida", "senate", "tried", "house"], "polarity": 0.014743589743589745, "subjectivity": 0.39316239316239315},

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

There are documentaries, films, talks, concerts and immersive experiences that, although distinct, connect to one another in surprising ways, hooked by the thick black thread of our humanity.\n\nIf you are interested in black life and culture, I have done the work so you don\u2019t have to. Herewith, 10 things every black person needs to see at Tribeca this year:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Can\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, documentary directed by Daniel Kaufman (USA); world premiere\n\nThe Uptown hustler is in the house. And Generation X gets to relive its glory days when Cristal was flowing, Diddy was bopping and thriving black businesses were in effect. CSWS runs with Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs for three frenzied weeks as he puts on his Bad Boy reunion concerts at Brooklyn, N.Y.\u2019s Barclays Center. Walk down memory lane with the Notorious B.I.G., Mase, Lil\u2019 Kim, Faith, Total, Mary J. Blige and more. This doc is a hot ticket, but passes may be available the day of.*\n\nAfter the premiere Thursday, April 27, Bad Boy will hold an intimate concert at the Beacon Theatre at 8 p.m. Buy tickets here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Copwatch, documentary directed by Camilla Hall (USA); world premiere\n\nBut as much as we love to party, the cops still keep beating our asses and killing us. And people keep getting it on film. We Copwatch, an organization that films police activity as a form of protest, highlights those unwitting citizen journalists who capture state-sanctioned brutality on video, including Ramsey Orta, who filmed Eric Garner\u2019s fatal arrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson, documentary directed by David France, written by David France, Mark Blane (USA); world premiere\n\nIf you know Baldwin and Rustin, you should know Johnson. The gay-rights movement has yet another black woman, Marsha P. Johnson, to thank for doing the work and fighting the power. Featuring never-before-seen footage and rediscovered interviews, Academy Award nominee David France (How to Survive a Plague) follows a new investigation into the mysterious death of the self-described \u201cstreet queen\u201d who left this world too soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism, virtual reality project creators: Hyphen-Labs\u2014Ashley Baccus-Clark, Carmen Aguilar y Wedge, Ece Tankal, Nitzan Bartov (USA); New York premiere\n\nIt\u2019s as if Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Andre 3000 and Erykah Badu opened a hair salon (in this case, a neurocosmetology lab) where black women can go to get their infinite life did. This virtual reality project centers black women, with speculative products like pink door-knocker earrings that act as cameras for police surveillance, and where, instead of braids, customers are fitted with transcranial \u201cOctavia [Butler] electrodes\u201d that allow access to a surreal alternate world. (Not just for black women, by the way.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I LIVED: Brooklyn, N.O.W. (new online work) directed by Jonathan Nelson and produced by Danielle Andersen (USA); world premiere\n\nLet\u2019s take it straight to the BK, the biggest (some might say baddest) borough in New York City, where Biggie Smalls, of course, remains thorough. Speaking of B.I.G., this online series begins in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant and investigates the intricacies of place and identity through the eyes of its diverse residents\u2014from a 15-year-old girl to a man who spent more than 15 years behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Saturday Church, narrative directed and written by Damon Cardasis (USA)\n\nCome into the world of Saturday church, where LGBTQ teens in the Bronx get their Jesus party on. This narrative is told through the eyes of Ulysses, a shy 14-year-old with a rich inner life. He sneaks downtown in his auntie\u2019s stockings and his mother\u2019s shoes to find a sanctuary, a shelter, a haven (funny how so many gay clubs have these names). There is music, there is freedom. With Luka Kain, Margot Bingham, Regina Taylor, Marquis Rodriguez, M.J. Rodriguez, Indya Moore and Alexia Garcia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The Rugby Boys of Memphis, short directed by David Darg (USA); New York premiere\n\nI actually used to play rugby in high school. We had a crazy Italian English teacher (Mr. Poletti) who brought the fiercest of games to our sports-deficient high school; it must have been hilarity to see a bunch of nerds running around a field on Georgia Avenue in Washington, D.C. Our team was co-ed and did it for fun, whereas in this short, the young men of a Memphis, Tenn., high school do it for so much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. For Ahkeem, documentary directed by Jeremy S. Levine and Landon Van Soest (USA); North American premiere\n\nA year before Michael Brown was shot down dead in the streets of Ferguson, Mo., his peer, 17-year-old Daje Shelton, was coming into her own in neighboring North St. Louis. As is typical for American teens, Daje falls in love, gets into scraps with her peers and fights with her mom. Yet as with so many black girl teens, the stakes are so much higher and the safety net so much smaller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Whitney. \u201cCan I Be Me,\u201d documentary directed by Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal, written by Nick Broomfield (U.K.); world premiere\n\nThere will never be another voice, another face, another cautionary tale. There will never be another Jersey girl extraordinaire, the most awarded female recording artist of all time, Miss Whitney Houston. Featuring largely never-before-seen footage, Whitney tells the story of the woman behind the soaring, angelic voice and the precipitous fall that no one could stop. A Showtime release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The People\u2019s House, virtual reality project creators: F\u00e9lix Lajeunesse, Paul Rapha\u00ebl (Felix & Paul Studios) (Canada); world premiere\n\nWho doesn\u2019t miss the Obamas? With every passing moment, Barack, Michelle, Sasha and Malia are looking like the best thing that ever happened to this schizophrenic country. Pshaw if you didn\u2019t make it to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. while they were there. Through the transportive power of VR, you can get a personalized tour from the Obamas through the West Wing and private residences, built, as Michelle Obama noted, by slaves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTen was a tight number because there is so much more at Tribeca ... black-oriented and otherwise.

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

Racial tensions at the school came to a head when students from the AACC decided to wear black in silent protest and in support of Black Lives Matter. The students said that they \u201cwere as a whole frustrated and fed up\u201d with dealing with racism at the school.\n\n\u201cWe the students came together and made the decision of wearing black to silently protest what is happening, to demand equality and fairness as an American, and to unite together as one,\u201d a statement from the club read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe silent protest got traction on social media, and the backlash came swift for the students. Some other students at the school criticized them for drawing attention away from Spirit Week. One classmate bid other students to wear Confederate-flag gear in response, and the black students decided to continue wearing black because, you know, their classmates were just clearly demonstrating what they were trying to stand up against.\n\n\u201cMany have been called the n-word to their face,\u201d the club members said at the meeting with Winters. \u201cSomeone was told if they don\u2019t like discrimination, they should bleach their skin. Others have been spit on.\u201d\n\nThe students in the African American Culture Club took screenshots of the racist screenshots from other students\u2019 social posts. Some of those students defended wearing the Confederate flag, with one person saying that it was \u201csupporting the South,\u201d while another told a student to \u201clearn their history,\u201d the news site notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStudents have also been verbally abusing African American Culture Club members by saying \u2018Go back to Africa\u2019 and using derogatory statements such as [the n-word],\u201d the students at the meeting said.\n\nSchool principal Jamie Dundee sent out a letter to parents Friday that cited an ongoing investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe administration was informed of various comments that were of an alarming nature,\u201d Dundee wrote. \u201cAs the investigation unfolded, we learned that a group of students posted comments over social media that contained racial and defaming slurs.\u201d\n\nGloucester County Special Services School District Superintendent Mike Dicken declined to confirm how many students were facing discipline, but he did say that the school was \u201cmoving forward\u201d after the incidents, according to the news site.\n\nNonetheless, Dicken called Monday\u2019s meeting with the NAACP \u201ca really positive meeting about culture and climate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom NJ.com:\n\nWinters said school officials made a commitment to racial equity at the meeting, and hopes that students who wore the Confederate flag can grow to understand why it may upset black classmates.

However, on the day he was meant to give the speech, the principal of the Pinetops, N.C., high school, with no explanation given, told him that he would instead have to deliver a short-paragraph speech that had been prepared by administrators at the school.\n\n\u201cI felt robbed of a chance to say my own words,\u201d the 18-year-old told the Post.\n\nHowever, encouraged by his mother, classmates and teacher, Wright decided to give his speech anyway. So when he arrived onstage later Friday, he pushed aside the folder that contained the school\u2019s prepared remarks and whipped out his cellphone on which his own address was stored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post notes, in video of the incident, the principal, Craig Harris, can be seen turning to another staff member and whispering in what appears to be disapproval as soon as Wright begins his own speech.\n\nHowever, Wright\u2019s speech goes off without a hitch, with the audience clapping, cheering and laughing.\n\nEverything seemed fine after that\u2014that is, until all of the students went to line up to receive their official diplomas. Wright\u2019s was missing, and his senior adviser told him that the principal had removed it because he had read the wrong speech, the Post reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll my friends were outside with their big yellow folders taking pictures, and I was still inside, trying to get my diploma,\u201d Wright told the Post. \u201cI was really hurt and embarrassed, basically humiliated.\u201d\n\nWright and his mother, Jokita Wright, blasted the school for censoring a student\u2019s words and then retaliating. When his mother complained to the principal, it was explained to her that her son had missed a deadline to submit the speech to the school. Marvin Wright said that he never heard about any deadline.\n\nIt took another two days before he got his diploma, when the principal dropped it off at his home at the request of the superintendent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Edgecombe County Schools superintendent later called Wright to apologize about the way the situation had been handled.\n\n\u201cI have communicated with the family to apologize on behalf of the school,\u201d Superintendent John Farrelly said in a statement. \u201cThe diploma never should have been taken from the student.\u201d\n\nFarrelly said there were no issues with the content of Wright\u2019s speech, but that it was more of a concern that he used his cellphone and, of course, decided to change course at the last minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is an expectation that is communicated to all graduation speakers that the prepared and practiced speech is the speech to be delivered during the ceremony,\u201d Farrelly said. \u201cThat was made extremely clear to the speakers. The student did not follow those expectations.\u201d\n\nWright said that when he was elected senior class president and was told he would have to write a graduation speech, he wasn\u2019t given any guidance. He merely asked for advice from the previous year\u2019s senior class president and listened to commencement speeches online to get ideas. He said that his English teacher gave him a thumbs-up for the speech, and then he left a copy of his speech on his principal\u2019s desk for review the day of the ceremony.\n\nNonetheless, the administrators handed him their own remarks to deliver.\n\nDespite the setback, the Post reports, Wright did get his diploma just in time for when he needed it most. On Monday, he officially committed to entering the U.S. Navy\u2014scheduled to report for duty on Oct. 10\u2014with plans to study pediatric surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["refuses", "speech", "wrights", "read", "nc", "diploma", "principal", "told", "high", "school", "senior", "written", "post", "wright", "withholds"], "polarity": 0.0975, "subjectivity": 0.4013095238095238},

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

I was also there for a couple days in February, 36 hours or so in 2013, and for three days in 2012.\n\nBy all accounts, this makes me a New York City expert. And, since I'm a New York City expert, I feel completely comfortable sharing a few observations about the city that are definitely true and definitely not biased or misinformed in any way.\n\n1. New Yorkers are known for being rude and inconsiderate assholes. I've found this to be untrue.\n\nI'd even say that, on an individual level, New Yorkers actually tend to be (gasp) nicer than the people I interact with in most other cities. Perhaps I've just been lucky enough to encounter some accommodating-ass New Yorkers, but whether I needed directions or recommendations on the best breakfast food within walking distance or recommendations on the best tacos within walking distance, they've generally been both extremely helpful and extremely willing to help.\n\nI honestly think the asshole reputation just comes from the fact that everyone moves and talks so fast. Which can give off the impression of rudeness, but it doesn't seem to be rudeness. They're just busy. It \u2014 and the general sense of being unbothered \u2014 also seems to be a protection mechanism. There are a sizable number of legitimately crazy people in that city, and moving slowly or being too outwardly sensitive can be an invitation for them to introduce you to their crazy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. If it's the winter, New York City is colder than wherever you are.\n\nAnd by \"if it's the winter\" I mean \"if it's any month other than July or August.\" It is always (always!) at least 10 degrees colder in NYC than it was wherever you came from to get there. And the weather is deceptive, because you assume a New York 30 degrees is going to feel like a Pittsburgh 30 degrees. But a Pittsburgh 30 is actually a New York 45. And a New York 30 is actually a Pittsburgh -7.\n\n3. Collectively, New York City cab drivers are either the worst or the best drivers on Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI still haven't quite figured out which one. All I know is that every time I'm in a cab, I get in at least 17 near accidents, but I can't tell if they're caused by the driver's recklessness or if they're only just near accidents because the drivers are so great at the kamikaze driving that seems to be a job requirement for a New York city cab driver. I've never not felt like I was in a scene from The Transporter.\n\nThat said\u2026\n\n4. Catching cabs in New York City is a stupid fucking thing to do.\n\nI had two appointments in the city last week. One of the appointments was a block away from my hotel, so I walked. The other appointment was in a different neighborhood, so I took a cab. When I arrived at my destination and told the person I was meeting that I took a cab, she made a face like a baby holding in a fart. She then proceeded to ask how much the cab was ($19, plus tip) and then let me know I could have caught a train for like 35 cents and got there in half the time. Which I already knew, but trains, well\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Riding New York City subways are like sex.\n\nThey're kinda scary and daunting and intimidating before the first time you do it, mainly because of a fear of doing the wrong thing. Also, syphilis. But then you realize that other people are doing it just fine \u2014 shit, even kids much younger than you \u2014 and you do it yourself and think \"Damn\u2026this was fun and easy! Why haven't I been doing this? And why are my shins wet?\"\n\nBut then, if you haven't done it in a while, that anxiety comes back. But then you remind yourself (again) of how easy it was and how low your chances are of contracting syphilis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Apparently, there's absolutely no reason to go to the Bronx.\n\nI don't mean this as shade. Don't want Peter Gunz's gaggle of concubines attacking me on Twitter. This is just reflecting what I've heard from New Yorkers, who don't put \"The Bronx\" in a sentence without also including \"dirty\" or \"rats\" or \"roaches\" or \"strip club shooting\" or \"Why the hell are you going there?\" (or all five) in the sentence as well.\n\n7. There is a Shake Shack at JFK airport. (Multiple Shake Shacks, actually.)\n\nI'm assuming this isn't unique to New York City and that there are Shake Shacks at other airports in the country, but I know there are multiple Shake Shacks at JFK. And this makes JFK the world's best airport, and the people who decided to put Shake Shacks at JFK the world's best people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Things always being open messes with your internal equilibrium.\n\nThere's really no other way to explain the surreality of living somewhere where people's schedules and activities are determined by when things close, and going somewhere where people's schedules and activities are not determined by when things close, because things never close. Aside from, I don't know, sunbathe, anything you can do at 3pm can also be done at 3am. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing, but I do know that it fucks with your concept of time and space and hunger.\n\n9. It is true that New Yorkers tend to have an elevated sense of self-importance. It's very annoying\u2026and perfectly understandable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI get as annoyed as everyone else does when meeting a New Yorker who acts as if their city is both the center of the universe and the only place that actually matters. But then you go there. And you walk around. And you happen to walk into the Viacom building \u2014 which is only the place where like 89% of the shows currently on TV are produced. And then you walk past Madison Square Garden. And then you walk past the building where the color blue is created and mass produced. And then you walk into the Levi's store and happen to see Bill Clinton trying on some 522s.\n\nAnd then you get it.\n\n10. You have to be rich to be an alcoholic in New York City.\n\nI had a $15 cocktail at the bar at my hotel. Which doesn't seem too outrageous, until you realize that it was happy hour and the cocktails were half off. This is why you read so many redemption stories about former Wall Street executives who became drunks and are now attempting to turn their lives around.

Nucera came under scrutiny after an 18-year-old accused him of bashing his head into a doorway and officers recorded him calling black suspects the n-word multiple times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliam E. Fitzpatrick, acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, called Nucera\u2019s actions \u201ca shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and never to mistreat a person in custody.\u201d\n\nMuch of the evidence in the complaint comes from secret recordings made by one of Nucera\u2019s fellow officers who was \u201cincreasingly alarmed by [Nucera\u2019s] racist remarks and hostilities toward African Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Sept. 1, 2016, police responded to the Bordentown Ramada regarding complaints of a fight between a couple who refused to pay for a room. The cops pepper-sprayed a young black man, 18, and a 16-year-old girl after the two got into a struggle with officers, according to court documents. The cops called for backup and Nucera showed up.\n\n\n\nAs officers walked the couple to the patrol car, Nucera grabbed the young man and slammed his head into a metal doorjamb, even though, the complaint points out, the young man \u201cwas not kicking or struggling.\u201d The 18-year-old complained that he might have a concussion but didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital after Nucera miraculously cured the young man by hitting him again in the back of the neck, according to the complaint. A few hours later, a police officer recorded Nucera making comments about the suspects and about black people in general.\n\n\u201cI tell you what, it\u2019s going to get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,\u201d Nucera allegedly said in the recording. \u201cAnd that nigger bitch lady, she almost got it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Courier-Post reports that Lucera went on to say:\n\nI just, you know what? It would have been nice if that dog could have come up. \u2019Cause they would have stopped, put down. That dog, that dog will stop anything right then and there [makes dog sound]. I\u2019m telling you. You\u2019d have seen two fucking niggers stop dead. I love when they do that. I just love that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the unsealed papers, Nucera had a history of using police dogs to intimidate African Americans. He reportedly enjoyed posting police dogs near the entrance of the gymnasium at high school basketball games when the mostly white town played majority-black schools to intimidate the black fans.\n\nOn another instance, the same officer who recorded Nucera after the hotel arrest taped the 60-year-old police chief talking about a black man or boy who was accused of slashing the tires of a police car.\n\n\u201cI wish that nigger would come back from Trenton [N.J.] and give me a reason to put my hands on him,\u201d Nucera is quoted as saying in the secret recording. \u201cI\u2019m tired of \u2019em. These niggers are like ISIS; they have no value. They should line them all up and mow \u2019em down. I\u2019d like to be on the firing squad, I could do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe complaint lists Nucera as making $151,418.31 per year. Since his retirement, he still earns six figures, drawing $8,832.73 per month.\n\nAlthough Nucera\u2019s actions are vilified by some and excused by others, the complaint does not indicate whether Nucera stood for the national anthem.\n\nRead more at NJ.com and the Courier-Post.", "keywords": ["hate", "man", "wanted", "isis", "charged", "complaint", "mow", "nuceras", "compared", "crime", "black", "young", "officers", "suspects", "nucera", "recorded", "chief", "dog"], "polarity": -0.07085124201195628, "subjectivity": 0.37643643063285914},

Leaving the Shine office with the large Webster\u2019s in her arms is a pathetic act of payback, she knows. But Janice brought the book with her when she started and she would be damned if she\u2019d let them continue to profit from her goodwill while she was out on her ass. If Pratibha Mirchandani hadn\u2019t been off at some sycophantic yoga class with who knows what celebrity this week, Janice might\u2019ve slapped the bitch across the face on her way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice thanks heaven for small favors when her Miata starts. The car\u2019s faded, weather-beaten paint job resembles the damp blob of blood on the Kleenex in her hand as she turns the key in the ignition with a little prayer. Janice\u2019s diminutive nose always bleeds out of nowhere when she is under stress, and stress seems to be everywhere she turns these days. Her right nostril drips annoyingly apace from her parking space on Wooster all the way to the West Side Highway. Which is knotted in traffic.\n\nShe rubs her hands together and reaches for the heater, flicking the switch before recalling that, as of last week, the car has no heat. Reflex action. Like a plume of blunt smoke her long sigh clouds before her big brown eyes, teary now with anger and frustration. Janice jumps at the honk of the Pathfinder behind her.\n\n\n\nSpring is late this year, a metaphor for Janice Johns\u2019 whole existence right about now\u2014like when is this goddamn winter going to end already? It seems to Janice that there\u2019s only one place where the weather is warm all year-round; it\u2019s always seemed that way to her. She promised herself at 16 that she wouldn\u2019t try to go there before her time ever again. She promised herself a second time at 19, after breaking the first promise swallowing sleeping pills at Dartmouth over Elliott Wills. And now it\u2019s April and the temperature is still brick cold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice stares at herself in the rearview. Her straight black hair just grazes her shoulders, and she\u2019s spent many patient years getting it to grow even that long, fighting tooth and nail with damaged split ends. Her brown eyes are wide, even wider when she gets angry, which she\u2019s been doing more often as of late. Her pert nose is too small for her face, a fact she\u2019s been acutely aware of her entire life. The tip wiggles up and down when she speaks, as conversationally animated as her full lips. Janice has the little beak that Janet Jackson\u2019s nose job achieves; she\u2019s always dreaming of surgery to attain fuller nostrils.\n\n\n\nA motorcycle zips through the creeping autos on the highway. Snowflakes slowly start sprinkling the soiled windshield of Janice\u2019s two-seater. She remembers last summer, when Pratibha Mirchandani phoned her Fort Greene apartment talking of her own appointment to editor of Shine and her need for a second-in-command. And though the perpetual indie-magazine-that-could couldn\u2019t pay much, the unemployed, \u201cfreelance\u201d Janice volunteered her services as executive editor. At 27, Janice felt dangerously close to steering onto the road to irrelevance backed up with so many other previously \u201cpromising\u201d young writers. Editors\u2019 calls tapering off now, her byline appearing less and less where it was once omnipresent. Shine was never shit, but Pratibha Mirchandani spoke of a relaunch, of a possible pickup by Hearst if they could just get a few issues fabulous-looking enough.\n\n\n\nPratibha Mirchandani was humble at that point. She felt guilty offering the pittance Shine could afford for Janice, for an editor of her caliber. Pratibha Mirchandani came up in the glossies at the same time and rate as Janice Johns. Peers then. The two puffed joints together in clubs before Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s smoking ban, complementing each other\u2019s articles with the flatteringly spurious, chatty equivalent of air kisses. The two managed to run their mouths without actually sharing very much. Janice knew from Pratibha Mirchandani\u2019s self-promoting pieces that she was born in Mumbai and moved to America at 12, the same age Janice moved from Co-op City in the Bronx to suburban Elmont, Long Island. Pratibha Mirchandani was tall and slim, lanky enough to call attention to her bony frame. Her eyes were dark, with a permanent-mascara look that recalled for Janice the kohl eye makeup of ancient Egyptians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice assumed the two could work well together, could improve Shine to a level where one day they\u2019d be collectively awarded corner offices, big bucks and book deals on the back end.\n\n\n\nShine blew up and Pratibha Mirchandani got extra.\n\nJanice remembers the Village Voice episode as the first sign. The arts weekly covered Bollywood, with an insert featuring young, gifted and Indian movers and shakers in New York City\u2014people like Jhumpa Lahiri and Pratibha Mirchandani, who brayed about her fame in the SoHo studio Shine calls an office for weeks and carries around the article in her handbag to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother indication was the Ford modeling gig Pratibha Mirchandani secured for her 5-year-old nephew, snarky nepotism at its worst, Janice thought. And then the actresses she began befriending, who naturally ended up with favorable items in Shine, started stopping by the office for long lunches. Pratibha Mirchandani never once introduced any of them to the skeleton staff.\n\nJanice triggers her windshield wipers, cutting obese arches against the snowfall. Shivering, she clicks on her radio\u2014\u201cEverything\u2019s Not Lost\u201d by Coldplay\u2014then clicks it off. She rummages through her purse to find Lubriderm for her parched hands. She wants some distraction to put a halt to running all this through her mind yet again, pissed off. Her subconscious has its own agenda.\n\n\n\nJanice shudders (from the cold?) remembering the gruff Con Edison men at her door coming to seize the electric meter. She bet on paying her sizable past-due bill when the Hearst ship came in to rescue Shine and she\u2019d lost the bet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer petite nose drips blood onto the paparazzi page of the Shine in her lap. She flings it violently at the foot of the passenger seat and pops the glove compartment for some napkins. Dabbing and pinching her nostrils, she recalls navigating her chilly candlelit apartment for over three weeks, editing front-of-the-mag pieces from computers at the Brooklyn Public Library. No more Shine assignments now. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 circulating with no takers. Verizon restricted her outgoing\u2014but not incoming\u2014phone privileges, her mobile long since disconnected. When her landlord handed Janice an eviction notice one morning\u2014she owed two months of back rent\u2014she\u2019d already packed boxes to move uptown to her boyfriend Drew\u2019s place in Harlem.\n\n\n\nYesterday was the lowest blow. Pratibha Mirchandani informed Janice by email that Hearst finally picked up Shine, but that her services as editor at large were no longer required. She parks in front of 555 Edgecombe Ave. after an hour of snaking up the West Side Highway nursing a nosebleed. Nightfall now.\n\nThe lights inside the Lincoln Tunnel streak past at mad velocity, reminding Janice of the Millennium Falcon warp speed on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d video arcade game she used to play at Green Acres Mall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can feel!\u201d she sings loudly, surprisingly in tune with Bono intoning from her speakers at full volume.\n\n\u201cFeee-eeeeee-eeell!\u201d\n\nJanice\u2019s weighty troubles fade behind her like the skyscrapers of Manhattan in her rearview, shrinking to a dot and then gone. A guitar churns, the solo kills. The Edge is a motherfucker. Her heart beats fast, pounding out of her chest. Her body struggles to process the methamphetamine and mescaline from the seven X tabs in her bloodstream. The narrow passageway to New Jersey is near empty. The Miata\u2019s speed is ungodly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHello, hello! I\u2019m at a place called Vertigo \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nJunior and his live-in boyfriend aren\u2019t expecting little sister Janice. Her visit will be a surprise, assuming she makes it that far, all the way to Summit. Janice loves this version of herself, the keyed up, bright, bouncy Janice Johns who first entered the world when her Elmont High girls made her acquaintance with coke, \u2019shrooms and blotters of acid (\u201cUnder your tongue like this,\u201d they schooled) at 14.\n\nShe fiercely nods her head to the drums, tresses shaking wildly, zooming through the Lincoln Tunnel. Approaching headlights on the opposite side of the road blind her a bit, making her a tad faint at the wheel, even with her adrenaline rush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanice hated leaving her friends in the Bronx, hated being the only Mary J. Blige fanatic in her new world of Guns n\u2019 Roses groupies. Her dad promised Janice she\u2019d thank him later, Mom always going along with the man of the house up until their ultimate divorce.\n\nJanice jets past an 18-wheeler like it\u2019s an opposing TIE Fighter in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n\n\nKaleidoscopic colors coil from a black nebula, an expanding universe packed inside Janice\u2019s inner eyelids. (Rubbing her eyes? But isn\u2019t she driving?) Automobiles are known to drive themselves when their owners are \u2026 incapacitated, especially when they\u2019re named. But Janice\u2019s blood-red \u201991 Mazda doesn\u2019t have a name. It doesn\u2019t even have antifreeze. Only an ignition problem and an ominous, persistent green leak from underneath the hood, spewing more smoky monoxide exhaust than usual from its tailpipe just this minute, like the Batmobile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Drew doesn\u2019t know anything about cars and it\u2019s a wonder the Miata starts every time Janice cranks it up, especially in this bitter cold. Is consciousness drifting away yet? If she has to ask, it probably isn\u2019t, she decides.\n\nWas she this high when she took her father\u2019s straight razor to her wrist, a week after her old Bronx day camp crush Tyran Brown told her after sex that she wasn\u2019t black enough? Janice couldn\u2019t win\u2014too ghetto for Long Island, too Oreo for Co-op, vainly hiding facets of one ethnicity in the company of the other. And what the fuck is that noise? Honking? No E-ZPasses to heaven?\n\n\n\nFuck! Janice stirs, eyes aligned with her steering wheel. What happened? Where\u2019s the air bag?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraning her head around, vibrant DNA-like helixes clouding her vision, she still makes out a Hummer parked behind her, and an SUV behind that Hummer, and another Jeep and more, all blaring their horns. Heads in knit hats jut out of windows, cursing. The Miata is smoking, dead.\n\n\n\nI swallow seven Ecstasy tabs and my car dies before I do, she thinks, the funniest thought she\u2019s had all day.\n\n\n\nHazard lights? Sure, why not.\n\n\n\nFrom her private patch of concrete in the Lincoln Tunnel, Janice sees streetlights at the mouth nearby, Jersey 200 feet off. She cracks the door, slams it behind her. Smiling beatifically, the Hummer leading a trail of autos curving around her busted ride, Janice walks toward the light.", "keywords": ["blue", "eyes", "shes", "week", "pratibha", "shine", "way", "mirchandani", "janice", "long", "black", "nose"], "polarity": -0.04810962185962186, "subjectivity": 0.5048397898397898},

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That. Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts? Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["didnt", "eyes", "daddy", "uncle", "bloody", "white", "jonah", "looked", "obadiah", "mae", "hezekiah", "mama"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

Campus administrator Pastor John Mark Turner told the news site that the school is investigating and attempting to identify the perpetrator in the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe want the kids to be polite and courteous and understand that their words hurt people.\u201d\n\nBut more than being hurtful, the latest note that the student found was downright threatening.\n\n\u201cI hope you die, nigger,\u201d the note, found on Oct. 18, read.\n\nThe student had found another message at his locker on Oct. 13 but had ignored it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGloucester, which is located in Sewell and extends from kindergarten through 12th grade, has a predominantly white student body; about 7 percent of students are black.\n\nThe Camden County East Branch of the NAACP has launched an investigation of its own and is marking the incident as a possible hate crime, chapter president Lloyd D.

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That. Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts? Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["didnt", "eyes", "daddy", "uncle", "bloody", "white", "jonah", "looked", "obadiah", "mae", "hezekiah", "mama"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

Cox (Getty Images)\n\nI probably watched less college basketball this year than I ever have. Actually, \u201cprobably\u201d is unnecessary. That is definitely true. For someone as obsessed with basketball as I am, this might seem odd. But I have a few perfectly rational reasons for this lack of viewership:\n\nThe second draft of my book is due soon, which means that some days I\u2019m working from 9:30 a.m.-ish to 5 p.m.-ish (on VSB stuff) and then from 9 p.m.-ish to 2 a.m.-ish (on book stuff).\n\nThe team that\u2019s usually my favorite to watch (the University of Pittsburgh) might have been the worst team in major Division I basketball this year.\n\nI\u2019m playing basketball three times a week now.\n\nMy nephew is the starting point guard for his high school team, and I\u2019ve been to several of his games.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve watched enough to have a general idea of who is good, and I know enough to know who the top NBA prospects are. So when I filled out my bracket this year, I went with Arizona\u2014the team that has the best NBA prospect (DeAndre Ayton) and three other players (Rawle Alkins, Dusan Ristic and maybe Allonzo Trier) who might be in the league.\n\nAnd then Arizona got blown the fuck out.\n\nUsually, when a lower seed beats a high seed that\u2019s thought to be a title contender, it\u2019s because the lower-seeded team shot the lights out. Or the higher-seeded team couldn\u2019t hit shit. Or maybe the game showed that the teams were actually a bit more equal than the seeds would suggest. But Buffalo beat Arizona like they were a No. 1 seed and Arizona was a 16. They didn\u2019t just beat them. They punked them. In the last five minutes of the game, Arizona just gave up. It was such a display that even though it ruined my bracket, I was rooting for Buffalo to run up the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the day after that\u2014and the day after Trae Young was knocked out, too\u2014I want everyone\u2019s brackets to be as fucked as mine is. I want UMBC to beat Virginia and Bucknell to spank Michigan State. I want Charleston to do the Charleston on y\u2019all\u2019s brackets\u2019 grills. I want to see Texas Southern and Trae Jefferson (my new favorite player in college basketball) in the championship game.\n\n(Also, if you have a minute, watch these clips of Jefferson in high school. You won\u2019t be disappointed.)\n\nBefore Arizona lost, I was normal and well-adjusted Damon. I was Damon with dreams and goals and a savings account. I was Damon who intentionally ate some kale yesterday because I knew I needed something green in my system. I was Damon who just really enjoyed a comfortable pair of socks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow I just want anarchy. I want all brackets busted.

She thinks that she\u2019s going to walk in and find me hanging from the ceiling, my neck stuffed into one of her good bedsheets, so she has taken me to the man she believes can bring me away from the darkness, off the devil music and back to the boy I never was, but the one she wants me to be.\n\n\u201cArthur, either you are outside in the next 10 minutes or I\u2019m sending you to stay with your father.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father is a zombie who lives in a small apartment in S.E. that isn\u2019t close to anything but drugs and a gas station that sells everything he needs to do drugs. I went to see him when he first got the apartment, right after the divorce, and I stayed up all night looking out the bedroom window onto MLK Ave. That night I watched a woman give a man a blow job behind a school and saw two kids, no older than me, beat an African taxicab driver to his knees for no reason. Once my mother realized that my dad, who had lost his job, only had his apartment because he let the drug dealers sell their drugs out of it\u2014which meant that they paid his rent and he got free drugs\u2014she stopped sending me there. From then on he became a drugged-out Aesop\u2019s fable, a stoned John Henry (if the hammer was a crack pipe) or all starving African children.\n\nDidn\u2019t do your homework! Your father didn\u2019t do his homework and look at him. Rules are there for a reason. Look how your father ended up living without rules. Didn\u2019t clean the dishes! You can go live with your father where that nigga doesn\u2019t even have plates!\n\nNormally I treat her stories like stories, just words without meaning unless I put them there, but this morning, something in her voice tells me she is tired. Maybe it\u2019s the absence of yelling that usually accompanies her threats, or maybe it\u2019s that she said my full name, which always carried trouble and consequence. Either way we both know that whether I was or wasn\u2019t trying to kill myself, sending me to live with the person who isn\u2019t living means that I stop living, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI walk to the car, groggy-eyed, open the door soft, fall into the chilly leather seat and slam the door hard. My mother slaps the back of my head, but I already felt it coming, so it didn\u2019t sting. She makes a left onto North Capitol, a right on Bryant, crosses First, and parks.\n\n\u201cWe could have walked here,\u201d I say.\n\nMy mother scrunches her face, and I notice that she is in full war paint: Eyes, lips and cheeks are all colored. Her light-brown hair is curled tight to her head. I also know that the reason we didn\u2019t walk the three-and-a-half blocks is that I embarrass my mother. My hair is pink. My girlfriend\u2014well, ex-girlfriend\u2014Dolphin dyed it pink right before we broke up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a foot taller than my mother and thin as a whisper. My T-shirt barely comes to my waist; my jeans look painted on, they\u2019re so tight, but I haven\u2019t broken them in yet, which is the only reason I wore them outside; they taper down to my platform black-and-white check Tuks. They\u2019re hard to find, but I got them at an old thrift shop in upper NW. I\u2019d like to think they were Ian MacKaye\u2019s old shoes, ones that he wrecked and ravaged playing night after night in some seedy basement that I was now lucky enough to wear. Of course the soles are coming apart and the once nubby black suede has turned into a washed-out gray, the laces look chewed, and these say that I have been somewhere and seen more than my age.\n\nMy belt is leather, thick, and has stick figure fish skeletons across it in white. My skin is my mother\u2019s\u2014brown like cooked chicken just set on the napkin to rest\u2014but my eyes are wild and my thick, nappy hair says that I am Zombie\u2019s son. I look down at my wrinkled white shirt and feel the shame that being me brings. I get out and shut the door softly.\n\nThe man who is to save me is short, broad and wearing a navy blue suit with thick pinstripes that look like they were drawn with chalk. The shoulders of said suit stick out wider than his shoulders and make his jacket look draped on and too big for his body. His skin and shoes are shiny brown, and his black-and-gray hair is cut tight to his head like a cigarette-ash skullcap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHey, Jesus,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cOh, I am not Jesus, son,\u201d he says. He smiles at my mother and turns back to me. \u201cI\u2019m not a pastor, either. I\u2019m a man of God, though, and your mother\u2019s worried. Consider me like a brother. Lot of folks \u2019round here call me Brother Krall.\u201d\n\nHe holds out his hand for me to shake it and smiles harder this time so my mother can see his teeth. For the most part, the tops of his choppers are whitelike, but his bottoms are dirty snow. He has one top tooth on the right side way near the back of his mouth that is framed in gold. Not a gold tooth\u2014he literally has a thin string of gold lining one of his back teeth. I smack the palm of his hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNice tooth, Jesus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNice church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start. I consider it a spirit house.\u201d\n\nWhere was God when Porch beat the piss out of me until I yelled that I was a faggot? Where was God when Blue took a piss on Mongoose with the mag spokes? Until we clear this up, God and I aren\u2019t really on speaking terms, but I see now why my mother has brought me to this place, and it isn\u2019t so much for my salvation as it is to feed her loneliness. My mother likes Jesus, and I\u2019m her excuse and her explanation. I don\u2019t even have to say anything, as my looks are enough to explain why she needs saving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer Barney-purple knit sweater is too tight and cut too low for the room, which is nothing but old people in the basement of K.C. Lewis Elementary. There are chairs that don\u2019t match. Some are blue, some are red and some look like urine. Jesus is talking to my mom, who keeps laughing and leaning forward, and every time she does, a little more of her hidden skin, skin that is only meant for the bathroom mirror, shows, and Jesus just keeps smiling and there is that tooth, that one way in the back that\u2019s lined in gold that is telling me that his first joke is to get her to laugh and then bend a bit, while the real trick is to peek down the front of her sweater. And my mother, the woman who less than an hour ago was calling me all kinds of ungodly names, keeps touching Jesus\u2019 hand and bending forward, and at this point, her V-neck sweater might as well be a U-neck.\n\nThese two old people flirting makes me want to rinse my eyeballs in bleach, so I stop watching my mother and Jesus and look around the room and see a laminated children\u2019s food pyramid with a cartoon white girl standing holding a half-eaten apple. Old food and juice stain the cement walls that aren\u2019t covered with tiles. There can\u2019t be more than 15 people here, who stand in the back eating doughnuts off a tilted conference table whose tablecloth is about as tight as my mother\u2019s sweater.\n\n\u201cMa, you want a doughnut?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt, don\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus knows about patience. Don\u2019t you, Jesus?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says.\n\nI ignore Jesus and walk over to the table and see that all the old people have totally killed the doughnuts. The face of the skinny guy crowding the doughnuts is plain, brown. His skin is smooth and he smells like wet wood. His tan leather jacket was probably cooler when Malcolm X was alive, since the collar is fat like butterfly wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo more glazed, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kidding? That\u2019s all I come here for.\u201d\n\nHe knows that I know there aren\u2019t any more glaze because I can see he\u2019s holding three stacked doughnuts in a golden glaze tower on a napkin that is wet with sugar. He is eating one, which means, by my count, he has had at least four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI look at his stack and then up at him, and he shoves the last bit of brown honey goodness into his mouth and starts on his next one. He looks back at me, scrunches his face, and I know that trying to get a doughnut from this old man would be like trying to get my mom to get off my back.\n\nI look over to the table: six plain doughnuts. I grab one, lick it and rub the licked side in the box that once held the glazed.\n\nJesus speaks.\n\n\u201cEveryone, if you want to find a chair, we can go head and get started.\u201d\n\nMy mother waves me off the table, and before I leave, I double-dip back in the glaze and shove the rest in my mouth. I can barely taste anything but thick cake dough. My mother is up front at attention, with her back straight and her chest out, and I wish I didn\u2019t have to be here to see this, her and Jesus all coy and stupid. The old people move like fat cows looking for new grass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sit way in the back and stretch my legs out straight when my mother looks at me and coughs once, strong, which is to tell me to \u201cget up here.\u201d I act like I don\u2019t understand. I point to my throat. Then I mime drinking a cup of water and lay my palm flat as if it is holding a tray, and then mime the drinking-water part again. She curls her top lip and snarls \u201cGet up here\u201d in a language that is an inch above a bark.\n\nJesus is waiting for me. He literally has his hands clasped tight in front of him like a prayer, and I can see he has a pinkie ring with a red stone in it. When I stand, I see that there isn\u2019t a seat for me near my mother, so I snatch a urine-colored seat on my way up and drag the legs against the cold fake-marble floor, and the noise, the steady claw of the metal legs against the ground, is upsetting everyone.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pick that chair up,\u201d my mother says, and I do.\n\nWhen I get to the front, my mother grabs my arm and squeezes, and I can feel her nails digging into my skin. I don\u2019t even care at this point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Krall,\u201d she says to Jesus.\n\nHe moves the pinkie-ring hand towards my mother like he\u2019s shooing her apology away.\n\nThen Jesus speaks again.\n\n\u201cFor those of y\u2019all that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m Brother Krall and I\u2019d like to welcome y\u2019all to the Bryant Street Spirit House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOr a fucking lunchroom,\u201d I mumble. My mother squeezes my arm again.\n\n\u201cCome on up here, Diane, as this works better with a partner.\u201d\n\nMy mother lets my arm go. I look down and see that her nails have left little marks in my skin. I rub where her nails once were and I can feel the divots. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but I rub it like it does. My mother ignores me as she stands up smiling like that fat white guy just called her out of the audience to play The Price Is Right. I want to vomit. She turns and puts her purse in her seat and pushes the sleeves up on her titty sweater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is ready for Jesus.\n\n\u201cNow, you stand right there,\u201d he says to her, and places her so that she has her back to him. She stands there giggling and peeking over her shoulder and looking back at the old folks as if she is really worried.\n\nThen Jesus says: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t make cars or know how to fix them, but let\u2019s say that Diane is a car. What kind of car are you, Diane?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fast car,\u201d my mother answers and then laughs and puts her face in her hands like she is embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, all cool and stupid. \u201cA fast car works.\u201d\n\nShe is flirting with Jesus, and I can feel little bits of dry dough in the middle of my throat starting to work themselves back up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, today, Diane, your fast car is stuck. The way the Spirit House works is, I\u2019m like a tow truck for God, and if you\u2019re stuck \u2026 \u201d\n\nHe walks towards my mother\u2019s backside, and he puts his hands around my mother\u2019s waist. \u201cI can pull you out,\u201d he says, and drags the word \u201cpull\u201d long and slow like an endless chain while he slowly brings my mother into him. My mother makes this \u201cWhy I never,\u201d old-antebellum-mint-julep face while Jesus stands there with my mother\u2019s butt pressed up against his dick. My mother leans her head back.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get unstuck?!\u201d he yells out from his stomach.\n\nAnd the old people all hopped up on glazed sugar start screaming back.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\n\n\u201cMove me, Lord!\u201d\n\nJesus smiles hard, and I can see that one tooth that is way in the back that is lined in gold, and the old people all hopped up on glazed doughnuts start laughing and yelling, and that thinly lined gold tooth almost winks at me. It almost says I don\u2019t know God; it almost says I\u2019m going to be in your house at ungodly hours in a wifebeater, boxers and dress socks; it almost says Go head and kill yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s embarrassing who now?\u201d I say when my mother gets back to her seat.\n\n\u201cA boy with pink hair can\u2019t tell me nothing about embarrassing anyone,\u201d she says.\n\nI wish I had worn the T-shirt I wanted to wear. It said, \u201cFishbone: Still Stuck in Your Throat,\u201d which highlighted the group\u2019s seminal classic \u201cLet Dem Hoes Fight,\u201d but my mother told me to take it off. So I switched it to a plain white Hanes undershirt in protest of my mother\u2019s ignorance about the best black punk band ever. I tried to explain to my mother that her insistence on sending me out of Stronghold and way off to St. Albans private school is what made me like this. I was never going to like the boys in Stronghold, loud and gangsta, and once I got to St. Albans, I knew I would never wear polo shirts and Sperrys. I was rebellious and confusing, a black kid who found refuge in punks. In hard core, in double bass drums, in power chords; in loud, sweaty concerts where blood and bruises were a badge of honor; in the glory of piercings and tattoos\u2014a visible fuck-you to anyone who didn\u2019t understand; in everything everyone else found disgust in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it was the dual shame I was attracted to, to be black and punk\u2014to be hated and denigrated in either world, to know that those who did understand were the only people for me. I tried to explain to her that punk culture was close to the radical \u201960s and all the shit that she glorified, wearing Afros and Panther buttons. What she wanted was an educated, conscious son who didn\u2019t end his sentences with prepositions; what she got was something way left for her, and at this point I think she would just rather me be gay. At least we could gossip.\n\n\n\nMy breakup with Dolphin led me here, to this lunchroom on this day with my mother, and I am wondering how any of this is supposed to make me better. I had already gone through the three phases of black crisis intervention: The first proved fruitless, since I am almost a foot taller than my mother and have her by at least 80 pounds, so when she threatened to beat the shit out of me, it did nothing.\n\nThe second phase didn\u2019t do anything, since I stopped caring what the family thought of me around the time I got my first pair of Docs and started listening to German punk. To her, shame was still an effective way of crisis management. So when she called everyone and told them that I was losing my grip since the breakup, I was already laying in the bed blasting Fishbone into my headphones and reading Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition out loud. And even with all the noise going, I could still hear my mother\u2014who was walking back and forth in front of my room\u2014saying to a person I believed was my Aunt Beatrice, \u201cThat boy is into that white stuff, and now he\u2019s all cut up over some white girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI kept yelling:\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nPart of her story was true: My breakup with Dolphin was tragic. It came after we\u2019d gone down to the Library of Congress to see a Baldwin retrospective, and I casually mentioned how I thought that being gay and dealing with his sexuality first allowed someone like Baldwin to really free himself into his work. She claimed that somehow I was being insensitive to the plight of the gays. I told her that wasn\u2019t the case. More was said. Mostly her talk-shouting about how could I be such an insensitive asshole. I didn\u2019t get it. She told me we were over. I really didn\u2019t get it. Days later, after hours of research on homosexuality and the Harlem Renaissance to help make my point, she stopped me before I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cArtie. This is so constricted. The whole fallacy of hetero relations and the conformity of the male-female domination is just \u2026 I don\u2019t know ... lame. Like your paying for the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any fucking money!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m saying, Artie; your temper, the structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomasine. You. can\u2019t. do. this. To. Me. To. Us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Dolphin.\u201d\n\nD-i-a-l-t-o-n-e.\n\nI threw the phone into the kitchen wall and it shattered into pieces.\n\nI got into my dark Levi\u2019s and my Fishbone Give a Monkey a Brain and He\u2019ll Swear He\u2019s the Center of the Universe T-shirt because I felt like if I was going to be the part, I might as well dress the part. I opened a bottle of Jack that I had under my bed and played Fishbone\u2019s \u201cServitude\u201d on repeat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got drunk faster than I thought I would, and by the fifth time the song came around, Angelo Moore kept yelling at me in his South Central falsetto:\n\nGod\u2019s not with you \u2026 holy roller \u2026 your heart dwells in hell.\n\nI raged. I launched myself into the walls of my room like I was in a mosh pit. I cut my shoulder on the door and the blood soaked through my shirt slow. I don\u2019t remember the cuts on my face or hands, as I was numb. I remember bleeding. I remember bending over to catch my breath, and then I remember the room shifting sideways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI threw myself around my room and shattered into pieces. My mother found me unconscious in the room with blood all over the carpet.\n\nThis is where the legend of my killing myself began.\n\nShe told me she was going to beat the shit out of me if I couldn\u2019t pull it together.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet some white girl run you down like that.\u201d\n\nMy mother was embarrassed when I started dating Dolphin. She thought it was a physical manifestation of my hate for her. None of that was true, but that\u2019s the way she would phrase it to her sisters, or the hen house, as Zombie called them when they got to squawking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Mom; I just love Dolphin.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dolphin.\u2019 You hear that, Bea? The bitch named after a fish.\u201d\n\nShe was naming herself after a freedom that she thought only came to animals left in the wild. She was trying to reclaim a part of her that felt confined by societal standards. She didn\u2019t like her birth name or even the idea of birth names, as she believed that naming someone was akin to ownership, and I explained all of this to my mom and told her that Thomasine calling herself Dolphin was no different then when blacks started changing to Muslim names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPlease stop comparing that little white girl to what we went through \u2026 \u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help the day my mother pulled up in her tiny gray Nissan Sentra and I was on the porch with Dolphin, who\u2019d just started letting her hair dread. We had already had sex in the house, but we knew to move it to the porch, as my mother didn\u2019t like it when we were home without her supervision, which meant me and Dolphin sitting in the living room while my mother watched TV in the kitchen. So by moving to the porch, we let her believe that we were sexless. My mother, who had just gotten off work, was saying something about getting something out of the back seat of the car when she saw Dolphin\u2019s thick blond dread in the front of her face.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked Dolphin.\n\nAnd Dolphin didn\u2019t get it. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was burning a hole through the top of her thick, dirty-blond hair. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was working over all of the black things stolen by whites. She didn\u2019t see that my mother was seething with a kind of hatred that only comes from realizing that you have been betrayed, because to Dolphin, she hadn\u2019t done anything to my mother. She hadn\u2019t stolen anything, beaten anything, taken anything from her. She sat there looking for something on her Chocolate Genius GodMusic T-shirt that said I was just in your house, in your son\u2019s room, in positions that only gymnast or acrobats should perform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need me to get something out of the car?\u201d I said, shuffling down the walkway towards Adams.\n\nMy mother, carrying her empty green mesh lunch bag from work in one hand and an elbow full of ungraded school papers, just looked down on Dolphin the way a slave owner looked down a slave deciding whether or not he should sell him. I could feel Dolphin looking out at me for safety, some kind of line that would bring her back to shore. But I had nothing for her, no net, no rope and no words to throw overboard.\n\nI looked at my mother in her blue school dress and red belt that came across her waist like the equator and then at Dolphin, so thin and pale in dusty cutoff Dickies and dirty red Chucks with no laces. The two women who would be the closest to my core, both oceans away. I looked down at the top of my red Dr. Martens that weren\u2019t scuffed enough to look believable, my boots that showed no signs of revolution, still carried the out-of-box shininess that showed my face to look just like what I was: sheltered. It was then that I realized that the truth didn\u2019t really live with Dolphin and me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back on it, this was probably the first root that broke through the pavement because no matter how much I loved pulling and kissing and tugging Dolphin\u2019s flesh, I just couldn\u2019t cross my mother. So Dolphin broke first. She looked away from me and down at her hands and then at her feet and then into the ground and off into a distance where my mother hadn\u2019t come home. And my mother let her off the hook and took her papers, her lunch bag and the last remnants of her Afro, the tiny hairs that she couldn\u2019t curl that rested on the bottom part of her neck, way lower than the de-revolutionized permed and pressed-out part that covered it, and pulled the screen door and walked into the kitchen. I stuck my hands in the front of my jeans and frowned my face the way that only wordlessness can leave jaws tight, and walked back from the car and sat next to Dolphin, who started crying.\n\n\u201cWhy does your mother hate me?\u201d\n\n\u2026 sujeta en mis brazos como un pez infinitamente pegado a mi alma r\u00e1pido y lento en la energia subceleste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is what I should\u2019ve said. I should have pulled on the only quote that I memorized from the Spanish version of Neruda poems that she gave me and that I struggled through that night with her on the phone and she giggled and said \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time.\n\nBut what I said in that moment when she needed me most, in that moment when my mother just walked in and crushed us back to babies, in that moment when I realized just how small we both were\u2014in that moment, all I could muster was, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t hate you; she just loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallelujah!\u201d A fat black woman yells who is too big to praise dance, so she just wiggles and holds her hand above her head, waving Jesus away.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is in full bloom, Jesus. He has a blue washcloth in his hand like dead roses, and every now and again he pats his forehead with it. He lost the jacket about six amens in, and his white shirt is now loose and wrinkled around his waist. When the sun comes in through the square-cut window in the lunchroom door and hits that back tooth that I feel like only I can see, it make his face shine. The slight glow off the thin lining that rounds that tooth like old piecrust is whispering in a language that only I can hear. I feel like it\u2019s asking, \u201cWhy do pastors and pimps dress alike?\u201d I feel like I hear, \u201cI can help you get closer to God.\u201d I turn to my mother to see if she is there with me when I hear, \u201cThese people aren\u2019t your friends.\u201d\n\nMy mother grabs my hand and holds it up to the air, and I snatch it down and ask her what she is doing. I never like when my mother forces my body to do stuff, as I have never been a fan of being pushed around.\n\n\u201cYou better put your hand back up in the air,\u201d she says.\n\nI can tell by the way the ends of her eyebrows are pointing down and inward towards her nose that I need to get it back up, so I do. Turns out, Jesus asked all the people who love God to put a hand in the air. And then he walks over to the doughnut table and snatches one of the empty doughnut baskets off the table so fast that the napkins and powder both fly from the basket and land perfectly on the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI told you we\u2019re small,\u201d he says as he hands the basket to a woman in the back of the cafeteria. \u201cJust remember when we are way out in one of those big ole churches out in Bowie and all of y\u2019all are elders, we can laugh about how we had to use the doughnut basket for the bread basket! Can I get an amen!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d\n\nThe doughnut basket makes it past me, and Mom puts in $5 for the both of us. I hear women in the back say that it was a lovely service as they gather their purses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cNext Sunday is couples counseling, so come back here with your boyfriend and girlfriends and I can show you how to get that train back on track.\u201d\n\nThe old men and women laugh, mostly at the idea that any of them have girlfriends or boyfriends, and it dawns on me that in my newfound singledom, I, too, am a part of this joke. My mother looks over at Jesus, giving him the nod, and then tells me that she will be in the car while I talk to him. He stands by the door shaking the hands of the old women leaving, who have a little bit of the gospel in their step now. When the last woman leaves, he shuts the cafeteria door and the sun stops leaking into the small window.\n\n\u201cCome on and let\u2019s talk back here,\u201d he says as he snatches his blazer and the doughnut basket off one of the seats. The room that he takes me to is right off the church, and I can tell from the red kick balls, movable balance beams, jump ropes and tennis rackets that this is gym storage. A desk sits near the back, and Jesus walks over and plops himself down in a wooden chair that doesn\u2019t flinch at his weight, and I grab a chair and put it across from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he says. \u201cPussy or money?\u201d\n\nI am thrown off by the word \u201cpussy\u201d\u2014not that I don\u2019t use it, but it feels strange coming out of Jesus\u2019 mouth, even with the tooth. I tilt my head like a dog that can\u2019t figure out if what his owner is holding is really a bone.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, man, you heard me; pussy or money?\u201d\n\nThe choice hangs between us, steaming like fresh-cooked pot roast with no knife.\n\nJesus speaks. \u201cThe way I see it, there\u2019re only two reasons a man would kill himself: pussy or not having no money. You too young to know what being broke really feels like, so it must be pussy. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s right, although I haven\u2019t been far-enough removed from Dolphin to reduce her to just a lone body part.\n\nHe leans and pulls the money basket off the table and sticks his fat fingers into the top.\n\n\u201cAlmost forgot,\u201d he says, and then reaches into his blazer pocket and pulls out two gold rings that have diamonds the size of baby teeth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBad luck to count bread without these,\u201d and he holds them up so I can see. The one he slides on his middle finger looks like a class ring, and the other he forces down his index finger looks like something a rapper wouldn\u2019t wear.\n\n\u201cNice rings,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got these off a sucker out Seat Pleasant.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if he means that he beat someone up and took their jewelry or he haggled a fool down on the price; either way I don\u2019t ask him to clear it up. Jesus licks his ringless thumb and counts each one of the dollars given him by the old folks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPussy can mess your head up,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t know what he means.\n\n\u201cTrust me when I tell you, you wouldn\u2019t be the first nigga to kill himself over a dame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe word \u201cdame\u201d feels like 1950s cop talk, and I try to straighten my face because I am sure that it says that I am lost.\n\n\u201cI knew when you walked in that you were strung out,\u201d Jesus says.\n\nI have him here.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do drugs,\u201d I say, and sit up straight, since this a common misconception that I am forced to take on as a black punk. Everyone thinks I shoot heroin because I am so thin, so I am always proud to boast that I am not Zombie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not my father.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t talking about drugs, man, although some people might call it that,\u201d and Jesus laughs hard at both his joke and my ignorance.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d I say, slouching back in my seat. Slightly defeated.\n\n\u201cBecause no man would dye his hair pink unless some nice pair of legs told him it would look cute. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesus dumps the coins out of the basket and starts counting. He isn\u2019t looking at me because he knows he\u2019s right. The day we went to get the dye, I wanted something less radical, maybe blond or a soft green, but Dolphin picked out the box of pink with purpose and told me that this was it, and like a heroin addict I was all in.\n\n\u201c$11.34!\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThat barely covers the cost of the doughnuts. I should play that number.\u201d He reaches over and grabs a small slip of paper and a pen, and I assume he writes down 1-1-3-4.\n\n\u201cYou gamble?\u201d I say, which even catches me off guard, considering that he has been talking to me about pussy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d He says. \u201cLife is a gamble and if someone has to win, why not Brother Krall?! You got to walk before you Krall.\u201d And Jesus laughs, and I don\u2019t get any of it.\n\n\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you think those old folks that came to see me today, how you think they feel now?\u201d\n\nThis felt like a trick. Some kind of question that he already asked me in a previous life where I had never met Dolphin or dyed my hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d I say, knowing that this is the response he wants and the one that feels easiest to give.\n\n\u201cYou damn right. Each one of them paid a dollar to feel better, and you think they got their money\u2019s worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou damn right they did.\u201d\n\nHe grabs the doughnut basket. \u201cSee, this here is short money; the real money is down the road when times get tough. I\u2019m with them now so that when everyone else leaves them, they know they still have me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when you stick it to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jesus says, patting the pocket of his blazer.\n\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d he says, holding a pack of Newport 100s towards me.\n\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\nHe pulls out a long cigarette, lights it and puts his shoes on the desk.\n\n\u201cSo I know how to save them,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThey\u2019re easy. They\u2019re ready to be saved; in fact, they\u2019re begging for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe takes a drag. \u201cThe real question is, how do I save you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny, since I didn\u2019t know I was lost.\u201d\n\nJesus blows out smoke.\n\n\u201cWe all are. The question is always, how do we get found? Maybe you find it in your music or whatever, but don\u2019t think for a second that you aren\u2019t looking. That\u2019s why pussy is so important. You never knew you needed it until you started getting it, and then when she takes it back \u2026 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m strung out,\u201d I say.\n\nHe shakes his head and smiles.\n\nAnd there is that tooth saying that Jesus is right again. Until I found Fishbone or Fishbone found me, I was lost. When I first heard Truth and Soul, I knew I was home. And before Dolphin and I had sex, I just thought she was cool; after that night in her car, I thought she was amazing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do anything but come back next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what happens next week?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou come in and set up the chairs and get the doughnuts straight, and in turn I teach you about faith \u2026 the great unexplainable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m a choirboy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you call yourself; I just need somebody to get the chairs set up. We got a deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess.\u201d And Jesus takes his cigarette and puts it in the corner of his mouth and leans his ringed hand across the desk and we shake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow get out of here before you start crying.\u201d\n\nI laugh and walk out of the office, into the cafeteria and out the door to my mother\u2019s car.\n\n\u201cSo how did it go?\u201d she says.\n\nI don\u2019t feel right talking to her about what me and Jesus discussed\u2014it was personal\u2014but I know she won\u2019t move the car unless I say something. I think about telling her that he isn\u2019t who she thinks he is, but instead I look down at my phone to see if Dolphin called and she hasn\u2019t, and for a second I don\u2019t feel as lonely as I did before.

I had come for a work event, and ended up with some extra time on my hands in the city.\n\nI should have been on a plane on my way back home to Los Angeles, but the way my airline was set up, they overbooked the flight and offered me a travel voucher plus a hotel room for the night if I took a flight the next day instead.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were having a light dinner and drinks at a bar in midtown. We\u2019d consumed plenty of tequila and were laughing and talking when I saw him out of the corner of my eye.\n\nYou can always tell when someone is sizing you up\u2014at least, I can. I could feel him looking at me even before I turned to see who it was. His silhouette was already commanding a presence in my peripheral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI turned, ever so slightly, to glance at him. He was looking right back at me. I flashed my cutest and slyest smize before returning my attention to my drink.\n\nIt worked.\n\nHe made his way over to us, and I pretended not to notice him as I laughed at something my friend said that wasn\u2019t even that funny.

He will unabashedly talk about using cocaine in every form. He lists barbiturates, hallucinogens and every imaginable mind-altering concoction in a history of drug use that dates to the \u201970s.\n\n\u201cBut those Percs and Oxies,\u201d he told me, describing the street names for Percocet and OxyContin, two of the more popular drugs on the legal opioid market. \u201cThat shit is the devil.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Newark, N.J., Mayor Ras J. Baraka announced that the city has filed a lawsuit against manufacturers of prescription opioid medicines for deceptive advertising and other claims. The suit targets manufacturers of drugs that have fueled an opioid epidemic that has crippled cities across the country and left many people addicted to the class of drugs.\n\n\u201cThe impact of prescription opioids on Newark has been catastrophic,\u201d said Baraka. \u201cEvery aspect of our city has felt the severe ramifications of the opioid epidemic, not just the substantial financial impact, including all the services we provide to residents, including public health, public assistance, law enforcement, emergency care, and services for families and children.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, filed with the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, names Purdue Pharma, L.P.; Purdue Pharma Inc.; the Purdue Frederick Co.; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA; Cephalon Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceutical Inc.; Endo Health Solutions Inc.; and Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt alleges that these companies \u201cunfairly and deceptively marketed and falsely advertised opioids, created a public nuisance, committed fraud and were thereby unjustly enriched at the expense of the city.\u201d\n\nAlthough numerous peer-reviewed studies have shown opioids to be addictive, the heart of the lawsuit claims that drug companies have trained sales representatives for years to minimize or totally discount the addictive properties of the medicines, marketing them as nonaddictive remedies for pain relief. The complaint alleges:\n\nTo convince prescribers and patients that opioids are safe, Defendants deceptively represented that the risk of abuse and addiction is modest and manageable and limited to illegitimate patients, not those with genuine pain... These depictions misleadingly reassured doctors that, in the absence of those extreme signs, they need not worry that their patients are abusing or addicted to opioids...\n\nDefendants deceptively advised doctors to ignore signs of addiction as the product of an unfounded condition it called pseudoaddiction. Pseudoaddiction was a concept invented to convey the idea that signs of addiction, including shopping for doctors willing to newly write or refill prescriptions for opioids or seeking early refills, actually reflected undertreated pain that should be addressed with more opioids\u2014the medical equivalent of fighting fire by adding fuel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from fueling the public health crisis, the underground prescription drug market and the trend of \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d (where patients use sometimes illegal means to get doctors and pain-management clinics to write multiple prescriptions), the opioid epidemic has created a subsidiary market for heroin.\n\nOxyContin became known as \u201chillbilly heroin\u201d because, medical professionals say, heroin triggers the same receptors as prescription opioids for a fraction of the price. The National Institute for Drug Abuse studied young heroin users in 2012 and found that \u201c86 percent had used opioid pain relievers nonmedically prior to using heroin, and their initiation into nonmedical use was characterized by three main sources of opioids: family, friends or personal prescriptions.\u201d The report concluded that the incidence of heroin use was 19 times higher among people who used prescription opioids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewark\u2019s lawsuit claims that most drug overdoses in the city are now due to opiods, forcing the municipality to arm officers and paramedics with Narcan, which reverses heroin and opioid overdoses, at the expense of taxpayers. Since 2014, the suit alleges, Narcan has been used more than 18,000 times.\n\nAside from the expense of first responders and health professionals, Newark claims that the companies that manufacture the pills increased the cost of drug investigations, incarceration and drug treatment. Even neonatal care has been affected, since the number of babies born addicted to prescription drugs doubled between 2006 and 2013.\n\nKilling babies to make a profit is an age-old concept used by American businesses, including the triangular slave trade, the National Rifle Association and the pharmaceutical industry. I would call it an evil concept from the depths of Hades, but hell is registered as a nonprofit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the devil wouldn\u2019t be that evil.\n\nRead the entire lawsuit here.", "keywords": ["files", "used", "opioid", "newark", "manufacturers", "public", "prescription", "heroin", "nj", "patients", "suit", "pharmaceuticals", "opioids", "drug", "lawsuit"], "polarity": 0.020008617925284595, "subjectivity": 0.44324595157928487},

So I'm saying it again (with some minor edits)***\n\nAs I type this, the remnants of a fried egg and bacon sandwich sits on a plate to my left. What was once a towering piece of sandwich art has been reduced to a dozen or so desolate crumbs and two lone strands of grated Parmesan cheese. If you squint, it looks like a map of Rhode Island.\n\nI live within a two mile radius of a supermarket and (at least) 20 different restaurants, and my refrigerator is (surprisingly) stocked. My food options are limitless. I chose to create and devour this sandwich because I had a very specific craving for the very specific combination of ingredients.\n\nI did not eat my fried egg and bacon sandwich and wish it were a Big Mac. Or a pizza. Or leftover roast beef. Or even a fried egg and sausage sandwich. I also did not attempt to make my fried egg and bacon sandwich taste more like a Big Mac, a pizza, leftover roast beef, or a fried egg and sausage sandwich. If I wanted any of those things, I would have eaten them.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t. So I didn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m full. And happy.\n\nThe 2014-2015 NBA season started yesterday. I am very happy about this. Basketball isn\u2019t just my favorite sport. It is my favorite non-essential thing on Earth, and I enjoy watching NBA basketball more than I enjoy consuming any other type of media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not unique in my interest in NBA basketball. I am, though, (somewhat) unique in my love for and acceptance of its current form. NBA basketball is my fried egg and bacon sandwich. I do not want it to be a Big Mac.\n\nI realize this food analogy is ridiculous. But to understand the NBA\u2019s strange place in our cultural zeitgeist, ridiculousness seems appropriate. Necessary, even. To wit, by every conceivable metric (TV ratings, star quality, estimated sale price of teams, quality of play, transcendent beards, etc), the National Basketball Association is thriving. Yet, a very large percentage of people interested in the league\u2019s success and/or demise remain convinced there are cavernous, fundamental wrongs at the base of it's foundation. Basically, the league is fucked up and needs to be fixed.\n\nThis in itself isn\u2019t ridiculous, or even unwelcome. If everyone felt the exact same way about the exact same things, we\u2019d all work at Trader Joe\u2019s. What is ridiculous is that its perceived wrongs are only wrongs because it\u2019s being compared to three completely separate and completely ridiculous entities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. An idealized version of an NBA past that never actually existed.\n\n2. A decidedly worse version of NBA basketball. (NCAA basketball)\n\n3. Walmart. (And, by \u201cWalmart\u201d I mean \u201cAmerica,\u201d and by \u201cAmerica\u201d I mean \u201cThe NFL\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, for those who believe the NBA has big problems, the NBA\u2019s biggest problems are 1. it\u2019s not something it never has been, 2. it\u2019s not a worse version of itself, and 3. it\u2019s not something it never will be.\n\nAnd this is why I love it.\n\nThorough explanations of why the idealized past never actually existed and why college basketball is inferior would venture into basketball wonk territory, and I\u2019ll spare you from that. Today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, lets focus on Walmart.\n\nThe NFL has parity. Well, at least the perception of parity. I\u2019m not even sure if Kansas City fielded a team in 2012. I think they used their football stadium for monster truck rallies and Civil War reenactments every Sunday. But they had one of the NFL's best teams in 2013. They did not win the Super Bowl. But, their fans legitimately believed they have a chance. This is great. For the NFL.\n\nThe NBA does not have the same type of parity. The season has just begun, but those who follow the sport already know there are maybe five teams with a realistic shot of winning the NBA championship this year. Naturally, any conversation that brings up the NBA\u2019s place in the sports universe will cite the NFL\u2019s any-given-Sunday-ness as the reason for its popularity, implying that the NBA would be wise to try to emulate them. And, this is wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unique nature of basketball means that a dominant player will have more opportunity to provide an impact on the outcome of the game. (As good as Peyton Manning is, he doesn\u2019t play defense, so he\u2019s only able to have an effect on half of the game. Lebron, on the other hand, can conceivably play every minute.) This makes it inherently less random, and the length of the NBA\u2019s schedule and the playoffs series format make it even less random. These dynamics combine to make the NBA the sports world\u2019s truest meritocracy\u2014which I love\u2014and asking it to be more random and more like the NFL is asking a fried egg and bacon sandwich to be a Big Mac.\n\nThere\u2019s also the argument that there are too many games. And this also is an argument that compares the NBA season to the NFL season. And this is also a ridiculous argument.\n\nWhile the common point of the argument\u2014less games means that each game matters more\u2014seems to make sense, it also implies that people who love football love it because there\u2019s less of it. Which sub-implies that people who love football don\u2019t actually love football. If you love something specifically because there isn\u2019t much of it, you don\u2019t really love it that much. You love waiting for it, looking forward to it, and craving it, but you don\u2019t love it itself. And, because I love watching NBA basketball so much, it doesn\u2019t matter much to me that the season is long and every game doesn\u2019t have the mythical import that a 16 game season might have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize the title is (somewhat) misleading. It outright says that the post will explain my love for NBA basketball, but the bulk of the post is devoted to one of the reasons why people who don\u2019t love it don\u2019t love it. This would seem to be a very insecure expression of love.\n\nBut all explanations of love eventually sound insecure. Not because the person in love is trying to convince themselves, but because any attempt to articulate and deconstruct love is going to fall short.\n\nBasically, I love NBA basketball because it\u2019s NBA basketball and not anything else. Which doesn\u2019t say anything.

However, a Northern California judge is expected to determine soon whether or not to revoke her death certificate and essentially declare her \u201calive\u201d again.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, court documents were filed last month to support the family\u2019s lawsuit to have Jahi\u2019s death certificate revoked. Retired neurologist Alan Shewmon said that videos recorded by Jahi\u2019s family 2014-2016 show that the teen is still alive.\n\nShewmon, the newswire notes, has been a longtime critic of how brain death is defined and has filed similar court documents in support of Jahi\u2019s family to overturn the death certificate. Jahi\u2019s family has long insisted that the teen, who was declared dead at age 13 in December 2013, was still alive, routinely posting updates about her and showing video clips of her twitching her fingers and toes.\n\nAs AP notes, several doctors, including two hired by an Alameda County court, have noted that brain-dead patients can still move or twitch sightly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJahi\u2019s mother, however, believes that her daughter has severe brain damage but is still alive.

New Jersey Medicaid has since picked up some of the cost of Jahi\u2019s care, although the exact amount has not been disclosed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA judge is expected to rule on the case in the next two months to determine whether the lawsuit will be allowed to go forward, AP notes.\n\nRead more at the Associated Press.", "keywords": ["jahi", "fights", "jahis", "lawyers", "court", "overturned", "declared", "california", "death", "mcmath", "certificate", "family", "teen", "dead", "determine"], "polarity": 0.03390151515151515, "subjectivity": 0.3218939393939394},

The high rate of exclusion means that 80 percent of criminal trials in Jefferson Parish have no black representation on the jury, according to the civil rights nonprofit Equal Justice Initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that this is by design.

That person would not be allowed to date T\u2019Challa\u2019s fake daughter because he would have been banished from the kingdom. Sadly, though, this is America and the White House is run by one of the most evil characters ever known to man: White Satan.\n\n\n\nWhite Satan does not care about domestic violence charges, unless domestic violence charges were connected to, say, a Latino-and-African-American football player who kneels during the national anthem; then the president would really care about domestic violence issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow reports are emerging that Rob Porter, the disgraced former White House secretary who handled classified documents although he never had security clearance, was lobbying for a higher position in Trump\u2019s administration at the time he abruptly resigned.\n\nHere\u2019s how CNN explains the White House\u2019s love affair with Porter:\n\nHis anticipated elevation further highlights how top White House officials were willing to overlook indications from the FBI that there were potential abuse allegations in his background in exchange for professional competence in a tumultuous West Wing. Porter had been actively lobbying to take on new policy portfolios outside the traditional scope of the staff secretary, one person familiar with the matter said, which included speechwriting duties and a role in planning policy rollouts. Neither of those tasks is traditionally carried out by the staff secretary. One of the areas Porter was set to delve further into was trade policy, according to the person. Porter was a regular attendee at a weekly trade meeting among top-level administration officials. He was also being considered for the deputy chief of staff position, another source familiar with the situation said. CNN reported Friday that Jim Carroll, who served as the deputy chief of staff for less than three months, was stepping down to helm the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Several White House officials, including chief of staff John Kelly, were receptive to promoting Porter. Kelly had told associates that Porter was one of the few competent professionals on his staff and wanted to ensure that he was being used to his full potential. CNN has reported that Kelly was aware for months of the potential that Porter\u2019s ex-wives could present damaging information on him. Kelly \u201cdefinitely wanted to expand his role,\u201d a source familiar tells CNN.\n\nIf only there were a group of superhuman women who could have stopped White Satan from getting into a office. A powerful group of women who donned magical pink pussy hats and who marched in force. If only those women had a candidate who spoke to their issues and rallied behind their causes, maybe the world would be in better shape and we wouldn\u2019t know Rob Porter as anything other than the scum he is accused of being.

I'm going to need them to stop acting like teenagers whose feelings get hurt on Twitter. I'm going to need them to log off and do their jobs.\n\nTo date, the president-elect and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff investigating a murder on a national stage can't stop talking or tweeting about their feelings. Donald Trump's history of being thin-skinned is well documented, but on Tuesday, Sheriff Newell Normand continued his string of odd behavior since the shooting death of former running NFL back Joe McKnight.\n\nAccording to reports, McKnight and Ronald Gasser, 54 were engaged in some sort of road rage incident that left McKnight dead at the end of Gasser's gun. Gasser waited for police to arrive on the scene, handed over his weapon and was handcuffed and arrested. Where things took a really strange turn was at some point that night, Normand released Gasser and then held a press conference in which he defended not only his decision to release him, but the shooter.\n\n\"Mr. Gasser isn't going anywhere,\" Normand said.\n\nIn learning that Gasser may have become a target of violence, a police cruiser was reportedly ordered to sit outside of Gasser's home. That's right, the police were protecting the killer while he sat in his own home less than 24 hours after the killing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, news stations learned that Gasser had been arrested and charged with manslaughter, not because the police released the information, but because reporters found that Gasser had been booked into the jail's public system. Later Tuesday, Normand held another bizarre press conference in which he read emails that people have sent to public officials since Gasser's release.\n\n\"You punk ass Uncle Tom coon, we saw you sell out to them you rat ass faggot punk,\" Gasser read. \"You ass kissing fa\u2014ot that has done little to our community. All we know is that you are a b\u2014ch puppet, you rat a\u2014 looking coon on TV; I bet they made you say that puppet boy, I know what I see, I know that Normand is a piece of sh-t and you stood behind that white boy with that bulls\u2014t, nig\u2014. You won't even stand with your people you self serving son of a b\u2014ch.\"\n\nLet me bring you back up to speed: road rage, 54-year-old white man shoots and kills ex-NFL running back. All the public wants is justice that looks like justice in the form of justice. That if the man who shot and killed someone is arrested, that he be put in jail, have a bail set and then a trial. What the people who want justice have gotten is the release of said killer and two lectures from the man who's supposed to be a catalyst for justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as the email, I call bulls\u2014t. I know the language was supposed to imply that the letter was written by a black person, in fact when the sheriff was asked why he felt it important to read the letter he devolved into another lecture about black on black crime, but I don't think any black person wrote that. I'm not saying it wasn't sent to an official, but I am saying that I don't think a black person sent it. The flow is off. We don't triple down on our slurs that way. There is a rhythm to our language and this sounds choppy and forced. I'm not saying that the sheriff wrote the note himself and then walked out there to make himself and his colleagues the victim of a murder investigation. I'm saying that it was mad bizarre for the sheriff to read that letter at that time if he wasn't trying to make himself the center of a murder investigation.\n\nTwice now, the public has been chastised for wanting a killer to be brought to justice by the sheriff handling the investigation. Twice now, this oddball, who keeps acting as if hurtful words are stopping him from doing his job, has lectured the public.\n\nThis is the Trumpian effect. Leaders no longer have to be above the fray, they are in the fray. And there appears to be a certain joy that a group of Trump voters feel in being openly racist. If the president can hate freely on Twitter then why can't a small backwoods sheriff turn a murder investigation press conference into a national dressing down. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has called for justice for McKnight. Maybe I missed the part where the sheriff has talked about making everyone in the community feel safe. So far we have two times where the sheriff has gotten into his feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, I can only give this dumba\u2014 sherrif and the dumba\u2014 president-elect a word of advice, we don't need your lectures or your leadership, but we do need you to do your job.\n\nAnd if being on Twitter or email is too difficult for your little fragile feelings then log the f\u2014k off.", "keywords": ["saying", "say", "real", "justice", "public", "normand", "read", "la", "nigga", "black", "im", "happy", "gasser", "need", "sheriff"], "polarity": -0.02292843691148776, "subjectivity": 0.3483319881624966},

Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening.

Sorensen denies those allegations and claims that he was victimized by Corbett.\n\nThe White House says that it learned of the allegations against Sorensen on Thursday night, before the Post made inquiries about it.\n\nIn a statement Friday evening, deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said, \u201cWe immediately confronted the staffer; he denied the allegations and he resigned today.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorensen told the Post in a text message that he resigned because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want the White House to have to deal with this distraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be able to focus on continuing President Trump\u2019s historic accomplishments for the American people,\u201d Sorensen said in the text.\n\nMm-hm. Sure, Jan.\n\nTwo days ago, former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter resigned after allegations that he was abusive to two ex-wives were made public.

The FBI declined the Post\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nCorbett first contacted The Post a week before Porter\u2019s case became public. She said that during her marriage to Sorensen, he ran a car over her foot, put out a cigarette on her hand, threw her into a wall and grasped her menacingly by her hair while they were alone on their boat in remote waters off Maine\u2019s coast, an incident she said left her fearing for her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd:\n\nShe said she did not report her abuse allegations to police because of Sorensen\u2019s connections to law enforcement officials. Corbett said several of the incidents involved alcohol and acknowledged that she slapped Sorensen a number of times after he called her a vulgar term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Sorensen released a lengthy statement in which he said that he \u201cnever committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, I was the victim of repeated physical violence during our marriage, not her,\u201d he said, adding that he had consulted with an attorney and was \u201cconsidering legal options to address her defamation.\u201d\n\nHe said, she said. What is the truth?\n\nI personally believe it is unlikely that anyone would resign if the allegations against them were false, but that is my opinion as a person who has never been accused of physically abusing a partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis administration seems to be full of serial abusers.

I doubt she gave much of a damn about the grade of barbecue sauce purchased with the tray of boneless chicken wings or the fancy new Pack 'n Play her grandmother bought her. And I know she gave no fucks about the party's superhero motif, because the first thing she did when seeing the bedazzled Batman shirt I wore was attempt to eat the bat.\n\nI'm not much of a party person myself, but I looked forward to this day just to be able to witness her experiencing it. Her face when opening and playing with her gifts. (Which, as usual for her, landed somewhere between slightly bemused and slightly annoyed. My daughter is British, apparently.) Her eyes when she heard the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song sung to her for the first time. Her tiny legs as she walked from the cake stand to the couch her cousin was sitting on. And those same tiny legs an hour later when she apparently forgot she actually knows how to walk now and just started crawling everywhere.\n\nShe is my Feminist Octopus \u2014 a name I\u2019ve given her because her favorite words currently are \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d And also because she\u2019s so damn curious and engaged with her surroundings that it\u2019s like she had eight limbs; all simultaneously grabbing and touching and pulling and pinching. I know it\u2019s not the most creative nickname, but I\u2019m her dad and I\u2019m allowed to be corny.\n\nOur house right now is an emporium of random baby shit shoehorned into an adult living space. It's like someone went to Babies R Us, emptied 20 shelves into 50 different bags, drove to IKEA, and arbitrarily sprinkled the bags' content throughout the store; a GRACO easy fold highchair parked adjacent to the living room mantle and both the fireplace underneath it and the 65 inch Sony 4K Ultra HD TV on top of it; Chicka Chicka Boom Boom laying on a SV\u00c4RTAN limited edition collection tray table. When babies arrive to couples who've never had children before, their presence is a colonization. A welcome colonization of course. A colonization with footies and frequent viewings of Sesame Street on YouTube (in Spanish though because we want her to learn that too). But a colonization nonetheless. Your resources are devoted to them, your thoughts possessed with them, your instincts stirred by them.\n\nAnd its with this context that killings such as the killing of Joe McKnight are so fucking brutal. So fucking complete. Not necessarily to me. I, like many others who heard of the circumstances surrounding his death, felt an appropriate amount of outrage, sadness, and perplexity. But I wasn't devastated by it the same way the grandmother who rented the space for his first birthday party 27 years ago, the uncle who first taught him out to catch a football, and the mom and the dad who had their lives upended and colonized by him 28 years are most definitely today. I can't conjure many fates more cruel than to have a life that was treasured, prayed over, sacrificed for, led, and loved snatched away so senselessly. And for everyone \u2014 including the police \u2014 to know exactly who did it. And for that person to be free. As if those decades of memories and moments and gallons of formula and refilled diaper genies and doctors' office visits and Polaroids of first steps meant nothing. Like none of that mattered. Like it didn't even happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts no secret that the undervaluing of Black lives isn't as much about a conscious and seething racial animus but more the inability to regard us as fully human; a dynamic that manifests as a reluctance to give our capacity to hurt, bleed, double over in pain, and die any benefit of the doubt. Its not that our lives and the diversity of life within each of our lives don't matter at all. They just don't matter as much. And for Black men and Black women as strong and sturdy and brown as Joe McKnight was, this modicum of empathy becomes nonexistent. He's been \"grown\" his entire life; a \"man\" since before he could ride a bike; a threat since before he could spell. Perhaps Ronald Gasser will eventually be arrested, charged, and convicted of his murder. But his freedom today \u2014 that he's receiving a consideration, a benefit of the doubt, that Joe McKnight did not, could not, and would never have \u2014 synopsizes America's feelings about men and women like the one he killed and the broken and brutalized families they leave behind; communicating to them and to us that those birthday parties didn't matter.

See, depending on who you are and where you grew up, the infamous \u201cu up\u201d text\u2014which is nowhere NEAR limited to college; some of you are preparing your \u201cu up\u201d texts right now and you have already pulled money from your 401(k) without penalty\u2014can either be sweet or effectively a last-ditch effort to reel in whatever booty you can get when all else has failed on the night\u2019s booty quest.\n\nI tend to side with the latter\u2014last-ditch booty-procurement quest\u2014which I do think firmly makes it a Chris Brown song, i.e., nonromantic. Chris Brown songs are all about that action at this point with no attempt at romance, subtlety or pretense. You want a song about drugs, sex and R&B gangbanging (of the Blood or Crip variety, though I suppose of the Bang Bros variety, too) that doesn\u2019t look to make any woman feel special? Well, Chris Brown is your guy. In that case, a \u201cu up\u201d text and a Chris Brown song are the same shit. I\u2019m surprised he doesn\u2019t have a song called \u201cU Up.\u201d (He doesn\u2019t; I checked.)\n\n\n\n2. What time is \u201cho time\u201d?\n\n2:30 in the morning.\n\n3. What does \u201chooking up\u201d mean?\n\nAfter Zoey receives her fourth \u201cu up\u201d text from Aaron, Nomi tells Zoey that a little \u201cd\u201d (or a big one) never hurt anybody, and Zoey retorts that she and Aaron are strictly hooking up, and everybody (including me) wonders what exactly that means since, for Zoey, it apparently doesn\u2019t include the \u201cd.\u201d This might be the most universally confounding question of all time; the truth is, nobody really knows. The ancient Mayans had theories, but so do the current Gucci gangers. It\u2019s all a mystery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experiences, to white people, hooking up can mean literally anything from making out to filming a flick with 17 people present. OR it can mean oral with no intercourse, which, to many, can leave you virginal. I haz confused. In this episode, though, even the white chicks think that hooking up means sex, as do the twins, Sky and Jaz. The only person who doesn\u2019t? Ana, who \u201chooked up\u201d with her uncle by having dinner in his hotel suite.\n\n4. Do guys talk about this shit\u2014ya know, hooking up and shit?\n\nYep. We do, and it\u2019s just as confusing for us (even in older age). Aaron is wondering (read: concerned about) why Zoey hasn\u2019t answered his \u201cu up\u201d text, even doing that thing where you move your phone around constantly JUST in case you missed a text because your phone is in a dead spot. Every millimeter counts, and yes, that\u2019s what she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAaron tells Vivek that they messed around, which means making out to Aaron but not to Vivek, who thinks \u201cmessing around\u201d means some \u201ctop-shelf action,\u201d but Aaron informs him that if there was a little sloppy toppy, then he\u2019d have said they kicked it. My head almost exploded. And that was not a pun, even though it kind of is. Even if I didn\u2019t intend it.\n\n5. What\u2019s a nudie bank?\n\nVivek is the guy we all hate. Period. In the first episode, he says his father is a bum even though by his own explanation, his father seems like a great dude. Upping the self-absorbed ante, Vivek views nudes simply as pictures of his dong that he sends to women. He\u2019s more interested in the pictures of his wang than the pictures of women he receives, which is probably none, to the point where he\u2019s curating a library of his own dong pics, which he probably views at least twice a day. Aaron has to explain that a nudie bank is the pictures from OTHERS you\u2019ve received, not those that you\u2019ve taken of yourself. #Fax #Facts\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Do chicks from the hood\u2014represented on Grown-ish by on-the-show twins Jaz and Sky\u2014watch Big Bang Theory?\n\nYes. Yes, they do, and to assume that they\u2019re stereotypically watching television shows like Basketball Wives is some racist-ass shit.\n\n7. How easy is it to spiral into an over-texting meltdown?\n\nCringeworthy-level easy. One of the funniest scenes in this episode is watching Zoey fall down the entirely one-sided texting rabbit hole with Aaron. She starts with her own \u201cu up\u201d text, coupled with the requisite IDC IDC IDC \u201cSorry that wasn\u2019t for you\u201d follow-up, ONLY to acknowledge that it was for him because really, she didn\u2019t want to him to think she was over him in case he might end up being over her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen we get to painfully watch as she tries to undo each previous text with a subsequent text that creates more ridiculousness, even getting to the point of talking about family diseases. The scene is PERFECTLY punctuated when Aaron sends the two words that not only run an alcohol-and-salt-dipped sword through your heart but also twist it: \u201cPlease stop.\u201d No extra caps. No exclamation points. Just simple, plain and painful. I cringed.\n\n8. Is Buffalo Wild Wings lit?\n\nAccording to Aaron, yes.\n\n9. Is it easy to be a player these days and juggle multiple people in a dating capacity?\n\nYes. Unless you are not built that way. Zoey is not built that way. At all. Most of us aren\u2019t. It\u2019s HARD work being a player, and if you have a heart to ANY degree, you will fail at some point. Also, Zoey is attempting to date two dudes who she keeps around her often.

Heilemann said that Kelly\u2019s recent actions exposed a \u201ccertain cultural and racial simpatico-ness with Donald Trump.\u201d A few seconds later, national security expert Mieke Ouyang added:\n\nBut the thing that\u2019s most disappointing to me about John Kelly in all of this is that I have known him my entire career. And I\u2019ve always thought of him as a man of integrity who would not tolerate this kind of violence ... and watching him do this, I\u2019m not quite sure who he\u2019s become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is apparent who John Kelly has become. The Caucasian confusion is only because he is now unencumbered by the restrictions of his old uniform and the protocol of the U.S. military. He has not changed. He has become an unfiltered version of who he has always been:\n\nJohn Kelly is a white man.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cOK, this is the part where Michael Harriot uses whiteness, and white men in particular, as a metaphor for Trump supporters, racists or how Caucasians, in general, have unmasked themselves in the Trumpian era. He will now equate Kelly with the cold, unfeeling audacity of whiteness and its unrelenting need for power and control, even if it achieves it by crushing the windpipes of any opposition. If sunshine is a metaphor for truth and freedom, then Kelly represents the cool, dark malevolence of whitemannery. Go on, Michael.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, B. This ain\u2019t no metaphor.\n\nI hate to use the phrase, but it is what it is. To expect some level of noblesse or unwavering integrity from him or any other white man is foolish. It ignores the example of history. I wish there were a more complex, nuanced meaning that I could extrapolate from this, but it\u2019s too uncomplicated to muddy with similes. The simplest explanation is always the most likely, and he is doing what white men do. He is doing what white men have always done. He is a man. He is white. Case closed.\n\nWhen Kelly assumed his role as chief of staff, from the way in which political analysts confidently explained how the decorated war hero would bring order and logic to the White House, I assumed that the Trump administration had mastered a secret DNA-altering process that would transform Kelly into something other than what he was. Men who have honor or integrity don\u2019t willingly get in bed with the devil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Kelly left mouths agape when he blatantly lied on Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) after she revealed Trump\u2019s crass treatment of the widow of war hero La David Johnson. He called Wilson an \u201cempty barrel.\u201d People could not believe that Kelly cast aside his credibility to dishonor a veteran, a widow and an elected official for the sake of politics.\n\nWhere the hell have those people been? Maybe I\u2019m the one who\u2019s delusional, but I can\u2019t recall a single point in history when white men haven\u2019t willingly thrown a black woman under an oncoming bus and willingly changed history to make themselves look better. Have they forgotten about the white men who called the cops on Rosa Parks, bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church or dragged Sandra Bland across the concrete?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen has a white man ever given a damn about a black woman\u2019s feelings, well-being or life? Can you name one incident when they have not been willing to lie and manipulate history to sidestep any responsibility on their part?\n\nWhen Kelly said, in an October 2017 interview, that Robert E. Lee was an \u201chonorable man,\u201d people thought that Kelly\u2019s background as a student of military history should have precluded him from making such an idiotic statement.\n\nJohn Kelly grew up in Boston. He has no ties to the South and is supposedly a patriot and a scholar. There is only one thing that could possibly give Kelly the warm and fuzzies about a traitor to the country he spent his career serving. One thing, and one thing only, connects him to the national assortment of Confederate sympathizers and rebel-flag wavers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know if I said this earlier, and I don\u2019t feel like hitting the scroll bar, but have I mentioned that John Kelly is a white man?\n\nWhite men have the privilege of disregarding facts that show undocumented immigrants work harder, commit fewer crimes and pay more in taxes. Black and brown people don\u2019t have the means or the need to create alternate versions of history or trade in demeaning stereotypes. When Kelly the Creator disparaged immigrants as \u201clazy,\u201d it was a luxury only white men are afforded.\n\nAnd none of this is to say that John Kelly wants to travel around the country lopping off the heads of Negroes, Mexicans and Muslims, just as there is no indication that Kelly ever possessed an unusual amount of the virtue and integrity for which he is so often attributed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe didn\u2019t set aside his principles when he joined the Trump administration; he has always been this guy. He has always been the recipient of the respect and admiration that any stone-faced white guy in a starched white shirt is accorded. That\u2019s essentially what privilege is: dignity by default.\n\nKelly\u2019s military career is laudable because he led brave men who defended this country. But his current career of leading a xenophobic group of racists intent on tearing this country apart is equally important. Neither of those facts means that Kelly is uniquely special or worthy of praise.\n\nHe\u2019s just white.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly attributed to White House chief of staff John Kelly a tweet regarding Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.

But SOMEONE.\n\nFrom the response of the crowd, I could tell that Tidal X was also fun, but it was also exhausting because it kept Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center rocking well past midnight.\n\nLike, until 2 a.m., to be exact.\n\nWith 100 percent of the proceeds going to victims of recent natural disasters in Houston, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Mexico, Tidal X boasted a lineup that could make your head spin\u2014both from amazement and bewilderment\u2014as everyone featuring everyone was on that night, from the beloved and highly favored (headliners Jay-Z and Stevie Wonder), to those you politely tolerated while everyone else went nuts (Chris Brown), to \u201cShe\u2019s still working?\u201d (Iggy Azalea), to the Bronx, N.Y.\u2019s finest (Cardi B and Jennifer Lopez, whom I now very badly want to perform together after typing this), to get-\u2019em-hype DJs (DJ Khaled and Kaskade), to a lot of, for me at least, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was both good \u201cWho?\u201d (Jessie Reyez, whose EP I immediately downloaded as soon as I got home, just off the strength of her performance of the very timely \u201cGatekeepers\u201d) and literally \u201cI had no clue they existed until Tuesday night,\u201d like Tee Grizzley, whom the crowd was definitely into even though I was lost in my own thoughts, which included \u201cI am old\u201d and \u201cWhen will someone sing or rap a song I recognize?\u201d\n\nThank goodness for DJ Khaled and his merry band of special guests, which included Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz and T.I. Otherwise, I might not ever have got hype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most focused on the night\u2019s overall theme of positivity and unity, with lots of shoutouts to Puerto Rico and its plight, not everyone stayed away from the political. Stevie Wonder, who closed the show (at 1:30 in the morning!!!), brought up how he recently took two knees for the nation in solidarity with the NFL protesters, and Pastor Donnie McClurkin called out for God to help in the White House.\n\n\n\nNo one said the president\u2019s name, per se, but it was heavily implied that something had gone terribly wrong in our nation\u2019s disaster relief efforts\u2014particularly in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where many are still without power and water\u2014and now it was up to the people, and the celebrities at Tidal X, to band together to get the job done.\n\n\u201cAs people with influence and the power to inspire and galvanize people, there comes a responsibility to use that platform for something substantial when given the opportunity,\u201d Chicago-based hip-hop artist Vic Mensa told The Root while walking the red carpet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI briefly chatted with Mensa about President Donald Trump and his tendency to bring up violence in Chicago as a counterpoint whenever others in the news try to focus the conversation on policing, police brutality, gun violence and mass incarceration. Mensa\u2019s response could easily have been applied to the situation in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not coincidental,\u201d Mensa says. \u201cThis is a tactic, a technique, if you will, of white supremacy. You create a chaotic, self-destructive situation for your capitalist constituents, then you let it tear itself apart, then you point to it as the reason to why these people can\u2019t be left alone to their own devices. You know, so, I just recognize it for what it is in its historical framework. It\u2019s not new. This is what white supremacy does. It\u2019s a mind game. And so Chicago is just [a] pawn in Trump\u2019s mass manipulative mind game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the concert didn\u2019t start until 8, I was there at 5:30 p.m. to work my first-ever red carpet, making this actually an eight-and-a-half-hour excursion. Somehow, in all my years of journalism, including entertainment reporting in ol\u2019 Bakersfield, Calif., I\u2019d never managed to work a red carpet where celebrities and wannabe celebs alike chatted it up with TV crews and bloggers. Let\u2019s just say it was an experience, and I\u2019m glad I was wearing tennis shoes.\n\n\n\nThankfully, I was sandwiched between red-carpet newbie, and digital editor at Fuse, Bianca Gracie and red-carpet veteran, and news and entertainment reporter for Hollywood Life, Jenna Lemoncelli. They both gave me tips: Be aggressive; keep questions light and short if the red carpet is crazy, since most folks won\u2019t have a lot of time to chat; and be aware that most of them are plugging a product\u2014like rapper Yo Gotti, who was wearing a silver jacket with black lettering detailing when his newest album will drop (Oct. 27).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person who was easiest to talk to was WBNA player, Roc Nation Sports member and recently wed Skylar Diggins-Smith of the Dallas Wings.\n\nI asked her if she had any advice for us out there looking for the kind of love she has with Daniel Smith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI married my best friend. We grew up together. We went to middle school together,\u201d Diggins-Smith said. \u201cFind somebody that loves you, cares about you, that you can be honest with, that you can be yourself with, and go there. Do it!\u201d\n\nOh, those honeymooners! They make it sound so easy! Lemme just go fire up Tinder right now and find that guy.\n\nWait.\n\nNever mind.\n\nThe concert\u2014one part music fest, one part endurance test\u2014tested both my ability to have a good time despite crippling anxiety from being in a large space with thousands of people and my ability to stay awake. It wasn\u2019t that the acts weren\u2019t good; it was more that I was already tired before I got there, willing myself to go on to get to Jay-Z\u2019s and Stevie Wonder\u2019s performances later in the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor most acts, the performances were short.\n\nThis was good in the case of some, like Iggy Azalea, who kind of rap-squatted her way through her song \u201cWork\u201d and then did nothing else, while a troupe of black women did the most, gesticulating wildly in support of this nonfactor of a song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWork,\u201d a song I kind of actually sort of liked when it first came out but had since forgotten about, was an interesting choice, considering that her biggest hit is \u201cFancy,\u201d a far superior bop, steadied by the poppy vibes of Charli XCX. But \u201cWork\u201d it was!\n\nPerhaps it was more a conscious choice to re-educate people about her background (the song features the lyric \u201cNo money, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami\u201d). Regardless, everyone just sort of politely sat through it and clapped (it was for charity, yo), instead of being dicks about her existence within the poppier end of hip-hop.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of only performing one hit, dropping a rap squat and sauntering off\u2014Cardi B performed her banger \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d and the New York City crowd collectively lost their shit. The regular-schmegular-degular girl from the Bronx went even further than \u201cbloody shoes\u201d and had a whole blood-red, skintight bodysuit on, complete with revealing cutouts and a lot of boob action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Cardi finished her hard rock performance, she dropped the patina of toughness and melted into all smiles, thrilled to be a part of the concert, sauntering off the stage while commenting on how \u201cfat\u201d her ass looked.\n\nOther notable moments:\n\nJay-Z\n\nObviously, this was the main draw here.\n\nJay came out and performed songs old and new, from opening with \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d to covering songs from 4:44, including \u201cFamily Feud\u201d and \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d He also did his half of \u201cNiggas in Paris,\u201d which mildly annoyed me because all I could think was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if Jay and Kanye had secretly made up already and Kanye was here, and then Kanye could come out and do his verse!?\u201d But that did not happen because, as far as I know, that has not happened. There were no big surprises like that during the night, unless you counted all of DJ Khaled\u2019s special guests\u2014which I do not\u2014because they totally did \u201cRuff Ryders\u2019 Anthem\u201d without DMX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their defense, though, DMX was probably busy with jail or something.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nI was surprised at how excited I was to see J.Lo. Maybe it was enduring all of the earlier, lesser-known acts whose songs I didn\u2019t know that made me all the more grateful that she came out to \u201cI\u2019m Real\u201d in a red, deconstructed hoodie-type onesie with thigh-high, sparkly red boots on and mermaid-long blond hair. I was happy to see her! She was like an old friend, happily still willing to go through elaborate dance routines for you, one more \u2019gain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was also disturbed to find that not only did I remember quite a few of the words from \u201cJenny From the Block,\u201d but I also remembered some of the words to \u201cOn the Floor,\u201d her last big hit. (Well, actually, I remember the words to this parody by the Key of Awesome better, to the point where I prefer the parody to the original, but that\u2019s beside the point.)\n\nFifth Harmony\n\nThe only songs by them I know are \u201cWork From Home\u201d (a song I like) and that nightmare song where they name-drop Michelle Obama. They did not sing the Michelle Obama song, thankfully. Watching them also made me realize that unlike with Destiny\u2019s Child, TLC, En Vogue or any other girl group of my youth, I could not pick any member of Fifth Harmony out of a lineup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(This isn\u2019t so much a slam on them as a slam on me for clearly being old.)\n\nI also hated their outfits (it\u2019s really hard to pull off pink latex).\n\n\n\nWillow Smith\n\nSmith did an acoustic set that the people behind me talked throughout, joking that she looked like her brother Jaden. They also seemed annoyingly unaware that she\u2019d done any music since \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d which is just ... I mean, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m old, and even I knew that Willow Smith has branched out since her initial stab at being a child pop star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just during Willow. These annoying people were annoying the whole night with their \u201cjokes,\u201d constant bumping into my hair, running commentary and shouting \u201cWhere\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9?\u201d when Jay-Z was performing.\n\nDonnie McClurkin\n\nIn a show where Jessie Reyez, quite passionately and explicitly, sang about sexual harassment in the entertainment industry on her track \u201cGatekeepers\u201d ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Yo Gotti talked about it \u201cgoing down in the DMs\u201d ...\n\nWhere almost every woman performing did it sans pants (with some notable exceptions, including Princess Nokia\u2014thrower of soups, first of her name\u2014and Reyez, who both rocked denim) ...\n\nAnd where Chris Brown\u2014CHRIS BROWN\u2014sang an entire song about the lack of loyalty among \u201chos,\u201d Pastor McClurkin was there to remind you about Jesus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI actually respect McClurkin for this. If you\u2019re looking to convert sinners, what better place than a Tidal X concert where Chris Brown is performing?\n\nI\u2019m not much of a follower of any religion, but McClurkin and his large backing choir were memorable and good. Also, McClurkin was there to remind everyone that this was a party with a very distinct purpose\u2014helping those in need\u2014which was nice.\n\nChris Brown\n\nAs if sensing me glaring at him from section 24, row 18, Chris Brown came out talking about how this night was about positivity. No negative vibes. Yada yada. My glaring, of course, meant nothing. Brown has a huge fan base, and they were very hyped for his marginal singing, schmedium bangers and admittedly fantastic dancing. Even I, a proud hater, can admit that the jerk can put on a show. Hence why it\u2019s so disappointing that his personality is so explicitly trash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, the show was for charity, so I sat there and watched, politely saying nothing. I wasn\u2019t the only one sitting down. But I was the only one sitting down not singing along the words to \u201cLoyal.\u201d\n\nYou let me down, guy also sitting, two rows in front of me!\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nThe magic of Stevie Wonder is that in concert, live, he still sounds the same as he did years ago when he first recorded many of his hits. Unfortunately, this magic was still not good enough to make me stay for all of Wonder\u2019s final set because my man the musical genius in all his old age did not take the stage until 1:30 a.m. I was bleary-eyed and starting to have a\u2014for real\u2014meltdown. I left just as he was going into \u201cSuperstition\u201d\u2014along with about half the audience, who were also pooped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so mentally exhausted and out of it, it took me a good 20 minutes to find a cab to take me home because I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the task at hand. My brain kept saying shit like, \u201cWe need to get home before we wander into traffic and get hit by a car,\u201d but my body was like, \u201cLet\u2019s stare at this streetlight for five minutes.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I did, eventually, make it home in one piece, but I doubt that I\u2019ll try another late-night, all-night music fest like Tidal X again. I loved the experience, but even Stevie Wonder couldn\u2019t keep my brain from fracturing into little pieces of woe from exhaustion.\n\nNo one can stop that. That\u2019s just who I am.\n\nChris Brown Stevie Wonder Remy Ma and Fat Joe Fifth Harmony Chris Brown DJ Khaled and T.I.

He then retreated into his apartment, where the couple\u2019s 10-month-old daughter, Anora, and 11-year-old son, Nigel, were. Witnesses said they heard two or three more shots.\n\nThe police and Ross exchanged gunfire during a six-hour standoff before authorities ultimately gained control of the residence and arrested him. However, the couple\u2019s two children were also found dead inside the apartment. One officer was hit by shrapnel in the gunfire, while Ross was taken into custody unharmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary Wogas, Iris Ross\u2019 sister, said that she got a text message from Anthony Ross on Christmas afternoon and immediately knew that something was wrong.\n\n\u201cI received a text yesterday about 2:52 p.m. Two messages, first one saying, \u2018I just killed Iris and the kids.\u2019 The second message was \u2018with a gun,\u2019\u201d Wogas said. \u201cI knew that man was very unstable.

I didn\u2019t know it was this dark.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that Anthony Ross claimed that he killed his two children inside the apartment during the standoff. He later changed his story, saying that the kids were alive and that he was threatening to kill them.\n\nHours before the carnage, Ross had posted a video of himself and a smiling Nigel, giggling as they attempted to sing some Christmas songs.\n\n\u201cHey, guys, I\u2019m smiling and I\u2019m hanging out with Nigel on Christmas Eve. We\u2019re going to embarrass ourselves! We\u2019re going to sing,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily and friends told ABC 15 that Ross began acting differently and making subtle threats after he divorced Iris Ross in June.\n\n\u201cThe man was off his rocker. One minute he was yelling at her, calling her a \u2018whore,\u2019 and the next minute wanting to tell her he loved her and wanted them to be a family unit,\u201d Wogas said. \u201cHe would also claim that he was working with a voodoo priest in New Orleans to put a hex on her. Just very, very dark, very dark intentions.\u201d\n\nThe family has started a GoFundMe to help financially support Iris Ross\u2019 family with funeral expenses for the mother and her two children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust last month, Anthony Ross was on the airways, testifying how a vegan lifestyle had helped him lose more than half his body weight and rebuild his relationship with his family. At his heaviest, he tipped the scales at 518 pounds.\n\nHe told KPNX 12 News that he lost the weight for his son, after being unable to go with his son on a Harry Potter ride that the little boy had desperately wanted to go on.\n\n\u201cHe started crying. It was at that moment I learned that the decisions I was making didn\u2019t just affect me,\u201d Ross said back in November. \u201cUp to that point, I thought, \u2018This is me. I have been heavy for so long.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that seemingly attentive father is facing three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated assault, 19 counts of aggravated assault against an officer and a count of discharging a firearm in city limits.

Sarah Palin, allegedly broke into his parents\u2019 home and beat up his father.\n\nAccording to a police affidavit the Times acquired, the confrontation began when Track returned to the family home in Wasilla, Alaska., to pick up a truck. The report indicates that Track\u2019s father, Todd Palin, told his son not to enter the home because Track was under the influence\u2014a mix of alcohol and pain medication. Enraged, Track insisted on entering and threatened to \u201cbeat his [father\u2019s] ass,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe confrontation escalated when Todd met his son at the door with a pistol. At one point, the Times reports, Track \u201cpleaded with his father to shoot him,\u201d but the elder Palin refused. The 28-year-old Iraq War veteran then broke a window, entered the family home and began beating his father, according to court filings.\n\nSarah Palin called the police at 8:30 p.m. When police met Track at the home, he reportedly called them \u201cpeasants\u201d and told the cops to lay down their weapons. Eventually they took him into custody (what a world, indeed).\n\nTrack Palin remains in police custody on $5,000 bail. No word yet on whether the Palins will blame Barack Obama for this, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s eldest son, Track, was arrested on domestic violence charges Saturday. While it\u2019s still unclear exactly what happened, Reuters reports that the 28-year-old was arraigned over the weekend for felony burglary, misdemeanor reckless assault and misdemeanor criminal mischief. (On the final count, online court records show that he caused up to $500 worth of property damage.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges all involved domestic violence and stem from a single incident in the Palins\u2019 hometown of Wasilla, Alaska.\n\n\n\nThis is the second time in two years that Track Palin has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. As the Los Angeles Times reports, court records from 2016 show that he was \u201csuspected of punching his girlfriend, who then became concerned that Palin was going to shoot himself with a rifle.\u201d\n\nPalin took a plea deal following the abuse incident that led to some of the charges being dismissed. He ended up pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm while intoxicated, a misdemeanor. The case was resolved in a special veterans\u2019 court, according to Reuters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPalin\u2019s girlfriend later filed for custody of their child, and in January of this year she asked for a protective order against him.\n\nSarah Palin has blamed Trash Track\u2019s violent run-ins with the law on post-traumatic stress disorder (he served in Iraq). Sarah even used Track\u2019s repeated violent behavior to question whether there was enough support and respect for military veterans while she was campaigning for Donald Trump last year (some military vets were absolutely not here for her scapegoating).\n\nOf course, Sarah Palin\u2019s compassion is nothing if not convenient. She has long boasted about being tough on crime, advocating giving criminals \u201ctougher, defensible sentences.\u201d Her son, meanwhile, never got charged in a 2014 drunken brawl that involved other members of the Palin family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Sarah Palin\u2019s concern about support and respect certainly doesn\u2019t extend to people of color: She has unapologetically referred to Black Lives Matter protesters as \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201crioters.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, Track Palin was still being detained at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility in Palmer, Alaska, multiple outlets report. The Palins have asked that \u201cthe family\u2019s privacy is respected during this challenging situation just as others dealing with a struggling family member would also request.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMmm-hmmm.\n\nRead more at Raw Story and the Los Angeles Times.", "keywords": ["son", "arresting", "track", "court", "peasants", "alaska", "violence", "called", "allegedly", "palin", "sarah", "times", "officers", "beat", "father", "tracks", "palins"], "polarity": -0.056196581196581184, "subjectivity": 0.37759724402581546},

From The Cut:\n\n\u201cNow SNAPCHAT I know you already know you ain\u2019t my fav app out there!\u201d She wrote on her Instagram Story. \u201cYou spent money to animate something that would bring intentional shame to [domestic violence] victims and made a joke of it!!!\u201d She finished the statement saying, \u201cShame on you.

After the physical altercation, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and making criminal threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Snapchat users to call out the terrible ad, which didn\u2019t just make light of domestic violence but encouraged it. The company was forced to delete the ad and issue an apology.\n\n\u201cThe advert was reviewed and approved in error, as it violates our advertising guidelines,\u201d a Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe immediately removed the ad last weekend, once we became aware.

That has long been established. It\u2019s more like, \u201cYou\u2019re Chris Brown and you\u2019re doing a mixtape with Brandy\u2019s brother? Why?\u201d\n\nNow, I find Ray J amusing on reality television. His battles with fidelity and not letting his wayward dick get in the way of his relationship with Princess Love makes great fodder for Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. However, when it comes to Ray J as an artiste, it\u2019s been a smooth while since he\u2019s had a hit. Shoutout to the Neptunes and the legendary Kimberly Jones for \u201cWait a Minute.\u201d Shoutout to you folks who love \u201cI Wish.\u201d I\u2019ll even shout out you fans of \u201cI Hit It First.\u201d That song gets on my nerves, but I will acknowledge that it\u2019s catchy whenever played. (Spoiler: I haven\u2019t heard it played in forever.)\n\nStill, while I know these two are friends\u2014which explains how the two found themselves in the studio together\u2014it\u2019s so odd to randomly and suddenly be greeted with news that Sinbad\u2019s former co-star has dropped a mixtape with the dude who looks like Sinbad\u2019s son when he\u2019s eating regularly. Yet, here we are. But since I signed up for this sadism, here is a track-by-track review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFuck Them Hoes\u201d\n\nOf course these niggas begin their project with a song called \u201cFuck Them Hoes.\u201d In the interest of fairness, I will say that the beat on this track slaps. That aside, how many songs does Brown have offering a faux apology about letting his dick slip and slide? To infinity and beyond is the answer. Then there\u2019s Ray J, who croons in a way best described as \u201cconstipated whisper.\u201d Perhaps \u201cconstipation\u201d is too extreme; if so, you can say he \u201csings\u201d in congestion and cigarettes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis song ain\u2019t it.\n\n\u201cAlready Love Her\u201d\n\nThis track sounds like everything we heard on the radio a few years ago, sonically. It\u2019s not a bad track, but it sounds very familiar to a bunch of other songs. Speaking of, like \u201cFuck Them Hoes,\u201d this song includes lines about codeine, ducking \u201choes\u201d and something about a Mercedes. And Ray J once again is doing that weird whisper where he sounds like his nicotine is low. What happened, beloved?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCome Back\u201d\n\nIn the first few seconds of \u201cCome Back,\u201d I\u2019m reminded that Ray J could sort of sing once upon a time. This is not to say that he sounds particularly great, but William Ray Norwood Jr. is trying here, which, by default, does make him sound better than he does on most of Burn My Name.\n\nAs for Christopher Maurice Brown, he may be a fuckboy, depending on the California judge you\u2019re discussing him with, but he does make solid songs about fucking. \u201cCome Back\u201d sounds like every other sex song I\u2019ve heard Brown make with this tempo, but obviously, this man is stubborn and reluctant to embrace change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSide Bitch\u201d\n\nOh, look, more melodic misogyny. \u201cSay you love me, bitch/You lying/Give your ass to all them niggas.\u201d Like many terrible men, Brown openly brags about screwing everyone, yet is vexed that some woman he\u2019s smashing is just as open as he is. So much of this man\u2019s music consists of \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d tunes, and this is peak Chris Brown.\n\n\u201cInterlude (Vince Staples)\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cCherry Red Vans\u201d\n\nThis song features Ray J singing as if his vocal coach were a bad-ass 12-year-old whose balls haven\u2019t completely dropped but are two lengthy bathroom trips away from doing so, \u201csinging\u201d the line, \u201cMy wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke.\u201d Return this bullshit to sender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNew Gang,\u201d Featuring LuvaBoy TJ and Truth KO\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of Blood references, which I\u2019m sure will be used in a future court case, \u2019cause Lord knows Brown can\u2019t get it together. In any event, this track should be called \u201cOvercompensation.\u201d It should also be skipped quickly.\n\n\u201cLet It Bang,\u201d Featuring Payso B, Jackie Long, Truth KO, Knotch\n\nRay J, weren\u2019t you on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood talking about selling some scooters or some shit last season? Can you go focus on that? Maybe go back to acting, which you\u2019re fairly solid at. Also: You\u2019re 36.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFamous\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t heard the tag \u201cListen to this track, bitch!\u201d in forever. Here, Brown and Ray J sing about \u201cmaking another one famous.\u201d I\u2019d rather listen to a track of Kim Kardashian and Karrueche Tran yawning for four minutes. Speaking of, round of applause for Tran for the early success of TNT\u2019s Claws and getting that restraining order.\n\n\u201cBurn My Name,\u201d Featuring Bizzy Bone\n\nEarlier in the month, I was reminded that Bizzy Bone is still with us after it was reported that his former fiancee was granted a restraining order against him after he allegedly physically abused and harassed her. Now he\u2019s recording with Brown (who is now on restraining order No. 2) on the mixtape\u2019s title track, no less. As for said track, it, along with the mixtape overall, is as good as Brown\u2019s reputation and Ray J\u2019s name around the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe production on the track is cool, but this song might have been better served if it were called \u201cDamn, I Fucked Up\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m Sorry for Everything\u201d instead of being such a poorly constructed attempt at martyrdom.\n\nLike, why can\u2019t Brown go meet a nice therapist and anger-management coach who helps steer him in a less misogynistic direction and then introduces him to some producers who could help him make the really classic R&B album he\u2019s more than capable of delivering? He\u2019s at, like, Mitch McConnell levels of stubbornness and hostility.\n\nIn sum, if you have yet to bother to check out this mixtape, do yourself a favor: Stick with that. Ray, get some vocal lessons and call the folks who gave you \u201cOne Wish.\u201d Chris, well, you wouldn\u2019t listen anyway, so, whatever.", "keywords": ["chris", "track", "say", "youre", "ray", "mixtape", "sounds", "song", "j", "hes", "love", "brown", "dont", "listened", "js"], "polarity": 0.14900252525252522, "subjectivity": 0.4604751113084447},

While this may seem like a result of the maturity of today\u2019s black celebrities, many attribute this year\u2019s lack of backstage donnybrooks to the presence of The Root\u2019s Danielle Belton and Yesha Callahan.\n\n\n\nEveryone knows they don\u2019t play.\n\nInstead of backstage donnybrooks, this year\u2019s antics were limited to the preshow ceremonies and the after-parties\u2014all involving the superstar upstart rap group Migos, who took it upon themselves to single-handedly fill the quota for celebrity shenanigans at BET\u2019s trap prom. The Root is here to answer all your questions about last night\u2019s melees between Migos and Joe Budden, Migos and Chris Brown, and Migos and intelligible lyrics.\n\nWho is Migos?\n\nMigos is a rap group made up of three guys from Lawrenceville, Ga., named Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, best known for the seminal hit song \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which\u2014if nothing else\u2014settled America\u2019s yearlong debate over what is the correct spelling for people who extend their pinkie when they drink Starbucks (except for members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, who are exempt from pinkie-extending judgment\u2014because they\u2019re all boujee).\n\nWho is Joe Budden?\n\nJoe Budden is a rapper best known for his beard.\n\nJust his beard?\n\nWell, Budden is a great lyricist and battle rapper, but it is a very spectacular beard, which covers so much of his face that some people get nervous looking at him because they think he might get some beard in his eye. Even though Budden has been a respected rapper for years, he is best-known for his role on the reality show Love & Hip Hop. Plus, no one can actually name a Joe Budden album. When I Googled \u201cJoe Budden discography,\u201d Google told me, \u201cAye, bruh, let me get back to you on that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did he get into a fight with Migos?\n\nAs a lyrical technician holding up the standard of hip-hop for over a decade, Budden has been a vocal critic of young rappers who make songs people actually buy. It\u2019s not that Budden is salty; it\u2019s that he can see the degradation of the quality in hip-hop over the years, and feels that groups like Migos and rappers like Lil Yachty contribute to the dumbing-down of the art form he loves.\n\nPlus, he\u2019s salty.\n\nBudden was on Complex magazine\u2019s show Everyday Struggle with DJ Akademiks when Budden threw down his microphone and stormed off the set in the middle of one of the stupidest, most inane conversations ever captured on video. But if you want to see it, here it is:\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that the group got into a chest-bumping and shoving match just out of camera range that was calmed down by bystanders. Afterward, Budden took to Twitter to explain why he couldn\u2019t contain his visceral look of disgust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why does Migos have beef with Chris Brown?\n\nFor the same reason all ninth-grade fights happen: Someone was trying to impress a girl. A member of Migos has reportedly been linked to Karrueche Tran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOoh, is that the new model Ferrari coming out in 2018? I want to drive one of those Karrueche Trans with the turbo! They say they go 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, but I heard they are really expensive. Migos is balling like that?\n\nNo, Karrueche Tran is an Instagram model who recently broke up with Chris Brown and got a five-year restraining order against him because he threatened to go Chris Brown all over her ass. Tran is now reportedly dating Quavo, which may be the stupidest sentence I ever typed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown was hosting a BET Awards after-party showing his new music video when someone from his crew punched Quavo and a fight ensued, according to TMZ. Los Angeles police surrounded the warring factions as Hennessy and blunt residue spilled everywhere, but video showed that it didn\u2019t get out of hand. Quavo didn\u2019t even ruffle his sequined crop top.\n\nThat\u2019s so terrible.\n\nActually, it\u2019s not. It marks major progress for the BET Awards. There have been much worse confrontations backstage in previous years. Remember the Rick Ross-Young Jeezy brawl? Remember when T.I. was arrested on the way to the BET Awards trying to buy enough guns to arm a small African country?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve had rappers die over beef like this. The fact that today\u2019s young stars are content to settle for slap fights and a few side eyes is pretty admirable.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking\u2014today\u2019s trap rappers are soft compared with the emcees from hip-hop\u2019s past\u2014but I don\u2019t think Migos are outlaws like that. I think they are young and rich and wanted to impress the one rapper at Sunday\u2019s BET Awards who showed that starting beef pays off if you are a real thug:\n\nRemy Ma.", "keywords": ["chris", "fights", "budden", "wanted", "ask", "rapper", "migos", "know", "afraid", "bet", "awards", "joe", "quavo", "young", "brown", "rappers"], "polarity": 0.04776188941082559, "subjectivity": 0.3881405237788217},

It seems this is what the Air Force calls it when you choke a woman and fracture a child\u2019s skull: bad conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is a person who had violent tendencies,\u201d Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday in response to a question about how Kelley, who is now dead, was able to obtain a gun. \u201cHow that got through the cracks, I don\u2019t have that information.\u201d\n\nBut come Tuesday, we did have that information: the Air Force did not enter Kelley\u2019s domestic violence conviction into the National Criminal Information Center database, so he was able to purchase an AR-556 rifle\u2014more or less a dupe of an AR-15\u2014from a gun store in San Antonio without incident. It is not a surprise when men like Kelley get through the cracks. Our system of regulating domestic abusers\u2019 access to firearms is all cracks.\n\nStill, there are other things that we know equally well, and which remain true and politically untouched no matter how many times we find ourselves in this same place: It is very easy to get a gun in the United States; and where there are more guns, more women die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost women killed in this country, 55 percent, die in an incident related to intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those women, more than 90 percent, are killed by a current or former intimate partner. Most of those deaths, 54 percent, are gun deaths.\n\nThis happens every day\u2014nearly three times a day, actually. But we generally don\u2019t talk about our dead women until our angry men kill other people\u2014at churches in Texas or baseball fields in Virginia or gay night clubs in Florida or health clinics in Colorado.\n\nWhen we talk about these dead women, or the women who survive domestic violence and function as a set of parallel statistics, it is often as a kind of foreshadowing to violence considered more consequential: mass shootings. The women are canaries in the coal mine, or the grotesque connective tissue that bind these shooters, overwhelmingly white men, to one another. In death, they are minor characters in some other kind of story about some other kind of violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen things quiet down again, we will return to a system that does not maintain comprehensive records on men barred from owning a gun, does not meaningfully enforce the laws that might take their guns away from them, and does not consider all intimate partner violence equally disqualifying. And so more women die. The daily realities of domestic violence fade into white noise until another mass shooting compels us to talk about it again, which is why I know we will be back here soon enough.\n\nFor more news and opinions that get under your skin, follow us on Facebook.", "keywords": ["domestic", "partner", "violence", "men", "women", "texas", "signs", "talk", "warning", "kind", "dead", "gun", "killed"], "polarity": 0.06928462709284627, "subjectivity": 0.40452815829528155},

Feel free to cue up select tracks from the catalog of the legendary Kang of R&B, Bobby Brown, while reading this.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would say that once again, the BET Awards proved itself to be the most vital and entertaining awards show on television. I get that it\u2019s a thing for some to pile on BET, but, beloveds, y\u2019all will never be this gassed about the MTV Video Music Awards, the Billboard Awards, the Oscars or any other awards show. Some of us will repeat that sentiment every year until y\u2019all shut the hell up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten the positive affirmation out of the way, let\u2019s discuss some of the missteps in terms of production. Clearly, this was the first show without Stephen Hill at the helm. The show lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled. I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense. And it was good.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Edition cast members: My first reaction was to objectify the adult actors, but I\u2019ll tuck in the thot and just say that, once again, they were fantastic. I really wish Luke James could score a moment with his own music. He\u2019s a phenomenal Johnny Gill, but we need to get him some music that\u2019ll let him body-roll and sing like that with his original music.\n\n\n\nThe real New Edition: BET has really earned back its investment with the movie. Bobby Brown\u2019s mint accessory made my night, and I like that even if he\u2019s moving a lil\u2019 slower these days, he still keeps up. If that set was a tour commercial, they succeeded with me.\n\nSZA: She sounded great\u2014awful opening that was no fault of her own notwithstanding. However, she probably should have performed in the first or second hour. The sequencing of performances felt off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nTamar Braxton: Tamar Braxton can sing exceptionally well, but she was not singing a lick during her performance of \u201cMy Man.\u201d So why she was aggressively moving her wig like it was dipped in a fire ant bed before she glued it to her head is beyond me. I saved this for last because it was the absolute most.\n\nAll right, before I (let) go:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers to Solange.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd Remy Ma for those wins.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye, blacks.\n\n", "keywords": ["forever", "felt", "say", "bet", "awards", "song", "chicken", "songz", "music", "love", "entertained", "let", "dont", "performance"], "polarity": 0.18189406065456484, "subjectivity": 0.5161022287702961},

Simpson was granted parole this past July, the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners, which considered his case, didn\u2019t take into consideration his 1989 conviction for beating his then-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson.\n\nThe reason? It apparently wasn\u2019t listed in a national FBI crime database, according to the New York Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe paper reports that the Nevada board\u2019s hearing officer, David Smith, says that the panel has asked for a second report from the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center to \u201cdetermine whether an error had been made.\u201d\n\nSmith told the paper that, months after the panel filed the request, \u201cwe have not been given any formal notice that the charges back in 1989 resulted in a conviction.\u201d\n\nThe charge\u2014and the conviction\u2014are easily searchable on the internet.\n\nProminent attorney Gloria Allred also noted that the Nevada parole board could have simply asked Simpson about the battery conviction, especially considering that the 1989 assault was presented as evidence during Simpson\u2019s murder trial. Simpson was acquitted in the infamous trial, only to be convicted later of armed robbery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had served nine years of a whopping 33-year sentence before being granted parole by the state of Nevada.\n\nSmith shared the information Tuesday. In the meantime, Nevada Assemblywoman Lisa Krasner is proposing legislation that would require parole boards to consider an inmate\u2019s history of domestic abuse before the inmate could be released.\n\nWhile Kramer claims that the measure \u201cisn\u2019t specifically tailored\u201d toward Simpson, the bill does set requirements regarding civil suits and truthfulness, both issues that came up during Simpson\u2019s hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Post:\n\nKrasner\u2019s bill would require the board to set specific standards in cases where an inmate seeking parole was held responsible for a wrongful death of another person and punitive damages were awarded. The measure also would require those seeking parole to sign a sworn statement that all information they provide to the board is true. If Simpson was required to testify under such conditions, he couldn\u2019t have told the commissioners he had \u201cspent a conflict free life,\u201d Allred said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the fact that public information about a domestic-assault conviction wasn\u2019t considered is a troubling reminder of how these sorts of cases are overlooked by the justice system.\n\nThis is less about whether Simpson \u201cdeserved\u201d parole or about whether his record of spousal abuse would have prevented the Nevada parole board from releasing him. The legal system, as a whole, repeatedly fails to take domestic-abuse cases seriously and take them into consideration where appropriate. Consider this: Over half of mass shootings (54 percent) between 2009 and 2016 involved a current or former intimate partner or family member as a victim, according to one study. The same study found that 16 percent of of mass shooters had previously been charged with domestic violence.\n\nThe Violence Policy Center reports that three American women are killed every day by their current or former romantic partners. And black women are disproportionately affected: They make up half of all homicide victims, most of them dying at the hands of person with whom they\u2019ve been intimate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, the National Rifle Association refuses to advocate restricting the gun rights of people who have been charged with domestic assault.\n\nIs Simpson likely to go on a shooting rampage? No. But the law that Krasner is introducing in the wake of his release is a welcome step toward making sure that an inmate\u2019s record of domestic abuse doesn\u2019t get buried in plain sight.\n\nRead more at the New York Post.", "keywords": ["domestic", "national", "record", "nev", "hearing", "simpsons", "simpson", "parole", "nevada", "board", "information", "require", "conviction", "abuse", "oj", "cases", "considered"], "polarity": 0.04905864575675897, "subjectivity": 0.37696098450815424},

This casting decision raises important questions about black entertainment, mental health and the blind eye we turn to violence against women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us were introduced to the fresh-faced Brown in 2005, when the then-15-year-old Tappahannock, Va., native and musical newcomer released the club hit \u201cRun it!\u201d Since then, Brown\u2019s career has been riddled with a series of arrests, court appearances and public incidents that raise questions about the 27-year-old\u2019s ability to take responsibility for himself and his actions.\n\nBrown\u2019s singing career has been essentially overshadowed by his violence against women.\n\nIn 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and served five years of probation after viciously attacking singer Rihanna. Yet he didn\u2019t learn much from the experience. After the two \u201cmade amends,\u201d Brown still didn\u2019t seem to view the altercation as much more serious than a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this month, Brown was served a restraining order after reportedly physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Her descriptions of the events that transpired between them include her claims of him \u201cpunching her in the stomach and pushing her down stairs.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t mistakes. They are evidence of long-standing issues with violence against women that the superstar has somehow managed to maintain while nurturing his on-again, off-again singing career.\n\nSome have suggested that Brown\u2019s issues with violence against women stem from substance abuse. To this effect, a Billboard expos\u00e9 published earlier this month claims that Brown has a crippling addiction to serious drugs like lean (a mixture of \u201cpromethazine/codeine syrup and a soft drink\u201d), coke and Molly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have said that Brown\u2019s aggression can be attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II, both of which he was diagnosed with in 2014. But the fact is, many people live with and manage mental-health conditions like PTSD and bipolar disorder every single day without physically harming anyone else. Studies actually show that bipolar disorder is not linked to violence. Rather, it is substance abuse that fuels the fits of rage against others.\n\nSo, yes, this is complicated.\n\nOn the one hand, Brown continues to show that he does not intend to take responsibility for his actions or his repeated injuries of his romantic partners. On the other hand, he is clearly self-medicating, which likely causes his violent behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsn\u2019t it time we started asking his team some questions, though? Why do they continue to watch Brown as he ruins his own life and the lives of others around him? At what point do they have that come-to-Jesus meeting and check him on his behavior? These are the types of preventive (and loving) actions that his family and friends should be taking. But it seems as if they are just along for the ride (a point made by Crissle and Kid Fury on a recent episode of The Read).\n\nMost importantly, Brown joins a long line of black men\u2014like R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Dr. Dre and many others\u2014whose artistic expression is often valued over their personal behavior. There are fans who would rather wear Beats by Dre than interrogate the irony of the brand\u2019s iconic name. They purchase tickets to awards shows and concerts where R. Kelly will perform, knowing full well that their money goes toward silencing the young black women and girls on Chicago\u2019s South Side who were reportedly sexually exploited by this man. These fans even say things like, \u201cBill Cosby has done so much for this community\u201d as Cosby himself admits to having drugged and sexually assaulted scores of women for decades.\n\n\n\nSimply put, there is no question that Brown has deep-seated issues with women and substance abuse. The two should not be seen as mutually exclusive. And what we shouldn\u2019t be doing is turning a blind eye to one in favor of the other, especially if it is only because we like his music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Black-ish team must know this.\n\nAlthough the producers and showrunners haven\u2019t yet spoken out regarding the casting decision, one could interpret the choice as an effort to support the artist through his rehabilitation efforts. But as late as 2014, the singer was kicked out of a Malibu, Calif., rehab center for allegedly breaking several of its policies\u2014namely, getting \u201ctoo close\u201d to women. Later that year, Rolling Stone reported on the prospects of a BET-backed Brown reality show that would chronicle his life following his arrest and stint in rehab. While the show never saw the light of day, it seems as though some networks are still willing to support Brown\u2019s behaviors even as he fails to change.\n\nTo empower Brown with a guest-starring opportunity on such a prominent black show\u2014which, mind you, employs black female activists who have repeatedly spoken out on issues that women of color face in entertainment\u2014seems counterintuitive and disrespectful to viewers who hold the show in high esteem. No matter what the intention, this casting choice reeks of enabling. It provides a blank check for a clearly ill person to continue to inflict harm on himself and those around him. Meanwhile, it sends the message that virtually any behavior is easily forgiven when ratings are at stake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of me wonders what the women on the show thought of this casting. I would expect Jenifer Lewis, Tracee Ellis Ross and Yara Shahidi to at least raise an eyebrow.\n\n\n\nWhile delivering a gorgeous acceptance speech at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards after winning for best actress in a TV comedy or musical series\u2014becoming the first black woman to win the award since 1983\u2014Ross said, \u201cIt is an honor to be on this show ... to continue expanding the way we are seen and known, and to show the magic and the beauty and the sameness of a story and stories that are outside where the industry usually looks.\u201d\n\nRoss hits on an important point here: Black-ish is such a powerful show mainly because it subverts the traditional storytelling and casting choices in Hollywood. It puts a quirky black family at the center of a universe and looks beyond the typical white veneer that has come to define so much of entertainment today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Brown\u2019s role on the show, Black-ish\u2019s producers run the risk of undermining these critical and hard-fought strides. While they are deliberately working against racial stereotypes through their full and vibrant depictions of black families, they still have an opportunity to tackle the nuances and complexities of gender and intimate-partner violence, especially where it concerns black women.\n\nBut casting Brown is a step backward. It proves that misogynoir and violence against women have still not registered with many leaders of industry as deal breakers for their faves. It is up to viewers to take to task the casting directors and the responsible parties behind this choice.\n\n\n\nWhat Brown needs is more (and better) people, not more casting credits. Until these record labels, networks and shows grapple with the equal importance of what these artists do both on and off the set, we must continue to hold them accountable.\n\n", "keywords": ["chris", "violence", "guest", "issues", "browns", "women", "casting", "substance", "singer", "blackish", "appearance", "brown", "continue", "black"], "polarity": 0.06144487200042756, "subjectivity": 0.49647560258671347},

It was included as an exhibit to a lawsuit, filed in federal court by the NFL Players\u2019 Association, demanding that Elliott\u2019s league-issued suspension be vacated. In its lawsuit, the NFLPA calls what transpired \u201cone of the most fundamentally unfair arbitral processes conceivable.\u201d\n\n... Elliott and the Union were subjected to an arbitration process in which, among other things, there was a League-orchestrated conspiracy by senior NFL executives, including NFL Senior Vice President and Special Counsel for Investigations Lisa Friel, to hide critical information\u2014which would completely exonerate Elliott\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliott was suspended by the league for six games for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy. The NFL investigation started after his ex-girlfriend accused him of domestic violence. Prosecutors in Columbus, Ohio, investigated but declined to bring charges, saying there was \u201cconflicting and inconsistent information across all incidents resulting in concern regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support the filing of criminal charges.\u201d The NFL conducted its own investigation and found that Elliott \u201chad used physical force\u201d against Tiffany Thompson. But the details of how the league reached that conclusion haven\u2019t been public until now.\n\nBefore reading the report, know that the complaint alleges it is incomplete and flawed. Thompson was interviewed six times, but just twice were those interviews transcribed. The NFL\u2019s report doesn\u2019t reach a conclusion and excludes certain key pieces of information, the lawsuit claims (bold is as produced in the complaint).\n\nFirst, after repeated questioning, Friel admitted that it was Roberts\u2019 conclusion that after review of the totality of the evidence, there was insufficient evidence to corroborate Thompson\u2019s version of events. Arb. Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 30), Ex. C. at 301:22-302:4. Friel admitted that this conclusion was excluded from the Elliott report, as a result of a decision that she made with NFL counsel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit also takes issue with many parts of the arbitration and hearing process\u2014it says that not having Thompson present for questioning was unfair.\n\nStill, this is the report that the NFL produced. It reads like the opposite of an investigative report. It opens with summaries of the events and then, at page 78, goes into detailed accounts of each interview, following the timeline of the investigative process. Unlike the NFL\u2019s letter to Elliott upon announcing his suspension, it does not state any definitive conclusions about who is right, who is wrong, or what might have happened. Unless indicated otherwise, everything that follows is from the NFL report.\n\nThe first part of the report is a summary. Here are significant parts from that section:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey met around Thompson\u2019s 19th birthday, in early 2015. She eventually considered herself his girlfriend; Elliott said she was just one of many women that he slept with.\n\nIn March of last year, the report states, Thompson found out she was pregnant with twins. Elliott told her to get an abortion; initially, Thompson told him that she did not want to. But she miscarried one of the twins a few weeks later, and she had an abortion to end the pregnancy soon after. One of Elliott\u2019s close friends, Alvarez Jackson, accompanied her to the abortion. Though the report notes that Thompson initially miscarried before going through with the decision to have an abortion to fully terminate the pregnancy, in the direct excerpt of investigators\u2019 interview with her, there is no mention of the miscarriage:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the first alleged incident from the week of July 16th:\n\nThe two were lying in bed between 4 and 5 a.m. on July 17 when a woman from Dallas Facetimed Elliott. When Thompson asked him about it, she said that he tried to have sex with her, and when she said no, he tried to have anal sex with her. She said no again, and Elliott became angry; he \u201cyanks me out of the bed and pushes me up against the door by holding me with both of his hands,\u201d Thompson told NFL investigators. \u201cHe chokes me and says, \u2018What did I tell you?\u2019\u201d\n\nElliott denied arguing with Thompson that night\u2014saying that another woman had Facetimed him, but that Thompson understood he was sleeping with other women\u2014and denied physically fighting her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson texted her aunt pictures of her bruised arms, neck and shoulders the next day. (The NFL investigation confirmed that the metadata showed the photographs were taken in the apartment on that day.) The NFL had two different medical experts review the photographs as part of the investigation. Both noted that several of Thompson\u2019s bruises did not appear to be fresh\u2014a week or two old\u2014while others looked consistent with bruises suffered within 24 hours of the photos being taken.\n\n(The NFLPA\u2019s lawsuit takes issue with these experts, saying \u201cUltimately, it was established that neither doctor could rule out the fact that the bruises depicted were consistent with numerous other possible causes apart from the allegations of abuse, including drunken and drug-induced falls, fights with other persons, rough sex and other possible causes.\u201d)\n\nOn the second alleged incident from that week:\n\nOn the night of July 17, Thompson went to work at a restaurant where she was a bottle service waitress. Elliott called her 20 times between 2:40 and 3:20 a.m. because he was locked out of the apartment and she had a key. When she returned to the apartment, she claimed that she found him yelling in the parking lot with his friend Alvarez Jackson. He opened the passenger door to her car, she said, and \u201creached over and grabbed her by the arm and pushed her back against the seat and grabbed the keys out of her hand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the third alleged incident from that week:\n\nElliott denied this incident happened, saying that the two had argued about her refusal to leave the apartment but that there had never been anything physical:\n\nOn the fourth alleged incident from that week.\n\nElliott denied this account of an alleged incident in the early morning hours of July 22, at Elliott\u2019s birthday party, held at a Columbus club, telling investigators he never put his hands on Thompson.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutside Elliott\u2019s birthday party, Thompson allegedly got in a fight with another woman. She claimed that there was no physical contact between the two other than hair-pulling. But a club security officer and two off-duty police officers working the event said that they saw the women throwing punches at one another, though they did not believe that any of the punches landed. A friend of Thompson\u2019s, Ayrin Mason, provided the following to Columbus police:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMason later told NFL investigators a different story, saying that there was no punching or kicking and that Thompson sustained no bruising in the fight.\n\n\n\nFollowing Elliott\u2019s birthday party at the club, he invited a smaller group to an afterparty at his apartment. (It is not clear if Thompson was invited or not, but she was there.) Thompson and Mason arrived before Elliott and were waiting in the parking lot when he showed up in a car driven by another woman. Thompson claimed that Elliott \u201cdragged her\u201d away when she tried to confront him, but all other witnesses interviewed by the NFL said this was not so:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson then called the police. She said she had domestic violence to report, caused by her boyfriend and that \u201che [had] been doing it for the past five days.\u201d When asked if he had hit her and where, she said, \u201call over.\u201d She told the 911 operator that she did not need a medic at that moment but would probably have to go urgent care at some point. Thompson also texted Mason, instructing her to tell the police that Elliott had physically dragged her out of the car. (These texts could not be obtained by NFL investigators, but the Columbus police accessed them and noted them in their initial report.) Thompson told the NFL that the texts were her telling Mason to tell the truth about what she saw. From Mason\u2019s account of the evening:\n\nPolice soon arrived, and Thompson told them that Elliott had assaulted her several times that week before finally yanking her right arm and dragging her out of the car just before her 911 call. Elliott said that he had not ever laid a hand on her and that any bruises she had were from her fight with another woman outside the club that night. Police did not file any charges that night due to the conflicting stories, and they told Thompson that she could go to the prosecutor\u2019s office to further discuss potential charges if she would like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that day, Thompson went public with her allegations of domestic abuse in an Instagram post. That afternoon, her father took her to the city attorney\u2019s office. An intake officer there noted injuries on Thompson\u2019s knees, hands, lower arms, right shoulder and across her neck.\n\nA week later, Mason texted Thompson, \u201cDo you want me to lie about what happened that night be zekes lawyer is about to call me again.\u201d Mason told the NFL, however, that she had only sent that text because Elliott had asked her to do so\u2014saying that his lawyers would need explicit proof that Thompson asked Mason to lie.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, two hours later, Thompson responded to Mason \u201cDon\u2019t lie if you didn\u2019t see anything happen then don\u2019t say you did.\u201d Mason told her that she hadn\u2019t lied to the lawyer and that she hadn\u2019t even been asked about that part of the evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes the second half of the report, which follows the order of the interviews conducted.\n\nTiffany Thompson, Sept. 26.\n\nThe NFL investigator repeatedly asked Thompson to explain differences between what she said and what other people have said. Here are a few:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliott\u2019s interview\n\nOn Sept. 28, the NFL\u2019s investigator talked to Elliott, who repeatedly denied hitting Thompson. When he was asked if he ever saw any injuries, such as bruising, he said: \u201cShe always would have bruises because she\u2019s a small girl and she used to get really drunk and fall all over the place. I mean, she would have bruises sometimes, but I really didn\u2019t see anything out of the normal.\u201d\n\nElliott didn\u2019t consider Thompson his girlfriend; he said it was a \u201csexual\u201d relationship, although he did provide her with financial support and helped pay for her apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe described it this way: \u201cBut I never was in a, was at a moment that I, did she ever think that we were in a relationship. She never at no time thought that she was the only girl that I was involved with. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nHe also talked several times about threats, he said, she made to ruin his life:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is another mention of a threat:\n\nThe alleged threats come up again on the night she called police, when, Elliott told investigators, that Thompson said nobody would believe him because she\u2019s white and he\u2019s black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond talk with Thompson, Oct. 6\n\nInvestigators have only a few questions for Thompson, including if she told anyone else in her family about the abuse. She said she told her Aunt Elaine and her mom. They also asked her why she she kept seeing Elliott. She told them \u201cI can\u2019t explain it; it was really bipolar. We had good times and really bad times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKaila Blades, Oct. 6\n\nBlades told NFL investigator Kia Wright Roberts that she had been friends with Thompson since the sixth grade, but Thompson had changed after meeting Elliott. She told Roberts: \u201cI don\u2019t know her anymore. She has a different outlook on life that I do. She hasn\u2019t even called to check on my dad with him having leukemia. She doesn\u2019t care.\u201d She was asked if she ever saw Thompson with a bruised face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyrin Mason, Oct. 6\n\nMason said she knew about the fighting but never heard about physical domestic violence before July 21. That day, Thompson showed her bruises and said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d She added that in the past she had gotten pictures of bruises from Thompson with captions like \u201cThe sex was rough, LOL.\u201d Despite all this, and a plan to file a police report, they went to Elliott\u2019s birthday party that night because \u201cshe knew there would be other girls there and wanted to prevent anything from happening with Ezekiel and them...she really does love him.\u201d\n\nMason said this about the text messages and the request to lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Glenn, Oct. 6\n\nIn her first interview, Thompson\u2019s aunt talked about how she told Thompson not to get an abortion. She went into detail about how Thompson\u2019s parents didn\u2019t like Elliott because \u201cthey knew that he was a college football player, and they were always out drinking.\u201d Elliott ended up financially supporting her because her parents wouldn\u2019t even let her drive her car to see him and Elliott \u201cwanted her to go to college and become something.\u201d\n\nGlenn said Thompson had told her about domestic violence, texting her pictures of injuries. Once she Facetimed with Thompson, who insisted it was \u201ctough love.\u201d She said she saw the injuries during a FaceTime on July 18. Before July, she said:\n\nSeveral times l suspected that he was doing things to her, but she always said that she had fell or blacked out. I\u2019ve been a victim of domestic violence before for years, and I know how people live. I didn\u2019t believe her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson\u2019s aunt would go into greater detail with investigators about the abortion. She said that she tried to talk Thompson out of it because \u201cabortion is murder.\u201d Instead, it ended with Thompson blocking her.\n\nAyrin Mason, Oct. 13:\n\nThe NFL questioned Mason about two text messages, including one from July 18 in which Thompson said she was going to call the cops. Mason\u2019s answers aren\u2019t much. After that, according to a footnote, she stopped cooperating with investigators, On March 13, she sent them an email saying she would not longer cooperate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiffany Thompson, Nov. 1\n\nThey go over the abuse, again, in chronological order.\n\nProsecutor Robert Tobias, Nov. 1\n\nTobias went over his investigation with Roberts. He talked a bit about Mason, saying that even when she cooperated, he felt like she did not want to be involved. Tobias also spoke about Alvarez Jackson, who he says told him that \u201cnone of those things had ever happened, and that he never intervened in anything.\u201d He also said that officers at the club described the fight between Thompson and the woman differently. Thompson and Mason described it as brief but \u201cthe police officers described it as flying, punching, and falling to the ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the text about lying: \u201cOnce we saw the whole string, it later said Tiffany told her not to lie.\u201d On the other witnesses, he noted: \u201cWe felt like the witnesses really rallied around their respective sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cTiffany just said that she wanted him to get counseling. Not vindictive, didn\u2019t seem like she had a vendetta. I feel like something definitely happened here. She had bruising. We couldn\u2019t determine exactly when and how she got the bruises, so we couldn\u2019t charge him. But that doesn\u2019t mean something didn\u2019t happen here.\u201d\n\nTessie Thompson, Nov. 3\n\nThompson\u2019s mother told Roberts that she saw bruises, but that her daughter probably confided more to her sister\u2014Thompson\u2019s aunt\u2014than her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Glenn, Nov. 15\n\nRoberts had questions about text messages between Elliott and Glenn around the time of the call to Aventura police. In the messages, Elliott says he is scared for Thompson. Glenn tells them, \u201cThey truly did care about each other, but her family life isn\u2019t great.\u201d\n\nTiffany Thompson, Nov. 16\n\nTony Thompson, Nov. 29\n\nTiffany Thompson, Nov. 30\n\nTiffany Thompson, Dec. 5:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sex tape\n\nOn Thompson\u2019s decision to look into selling a sex tape of her and Elliott after the prosecutor\u2019s office declined to bring charges:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther evidence\n\nThe NFL requested that Elliott provide his texts and call logs with Thompson over a certain period, but he provided \u201credacted, incomplete\u201d records: \u201cNone of the records provided contained the substance of any text messages, nor the call logs from from Mr. Elliott\u2019s two cell phones and to date, such evidence has not been provided.\u201d\n\nOn the medical experts\u2019 analysis of Thompson\u2019s bruises in the available photographs:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report is one of dozens of exhibits attached to the NFLPA\u2019s court filing, and we\u2019re still going through them. The NFLPA is expected to file more paperwork today, including seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately block Elliott\u2019s suspension.\n\n\n\nDeadspin staff writer Patrick Redford contributed to this report.\n\n", "keywords": ["investigative", "thompson", "nfl", "bruises", "heres", "nfls", "told", "mason", "thompsons", "asked", "elliott", "report", "ezekiel", "investigators"], "polarity": 0.032776438465061224, "subjectivity": 0.35900342172797284},

Her sister, Wanda Pasha, was separating from her increasingly violent and erratic husband, who lay in wait at her Piscataway, N.J., home. He shot and killed Baraka and Holmes, spinning a community into an all-too-familiar grief.\n\nFourteen years later, Newark, N.J., Mayor Ras Baraka cut the ribbon for the Shani Baraka Women\u2019s Resource Center in the city\u2019s South Ward, blocks from where Shani grew up. In what was once a years-old abandoned lot now stands the 12,000-square-foot building, a beacon for women in crisis.\n\n\n\n\u201cShani was my sister, my baby sister, but she really was like my big sister in the community,\u201d Ras Baraka says. \u201cShe represented a lot to me and our neighborhood.\u201d\n\n\n\nShani Baraka was a lifelong Newark resident who taught science and language arts at Vailsburg Middle School.

Research indicates that at least 40 percent of women killed in intimate-partner homicides in the nation are black; it is the leading cause of death for black women between the ages of 15 and 45.

According to a 2013 report (pdf) from the New Jersey Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board, there are some unique factors that prevent black women from seeking help. These include systemic racial and gendered oppression, as well as economic and immigration status. But there are also cultural barriers, like not seeing themselves reflected in existing services, racial loyalty, fear of being judged, religion and\u2014my words\u2014always placing themselves last.\n\n\n\nIsabel Livingston doesn\u2019t fit the \u201ctype\u201d of an abused woman.

When she sought help, it came full circle for her.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I came through the doors of the center, I had been dealing with trauma from my childhood and some of the abuse that I had experienced,\u201d the 44-year-old Newark native says. \u201cIt was the first time that I had ever talked to someone about what I was experiencing.\u201d\n\nLivingston says that she knew Shani as a kid, and joined the high school basketball team because of her: \u201cIt was the first and only time I was ever on a team, but she changed my life and how I felt about myself.\u201d\n\nShe explained that because neither she nor her abuser (a man of economic means and community standing) fit into stereotypes of a survivor or a batterer, she dreaded judgment above all else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, and with encouragement from staff at the center, she was able to call together about 50 members of her inner circle and publicly tell her story.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt felt amazing not to have to walk around with the guilt and the shame of the entire situation,\u201d she says. \u201cI think when people look a certain way, because the expectation of life is different for them, it makes it harder to come forward. People look at them and say, \u2018Oh, how could you or why would you?\u2019 So I think that may be part of the reason why I stayed silent for so long, because I certainly didn\u2019t want to disappoint people.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince opening its doors in May, the Shani Baraka Women\u2019s Resource Center has served over 1,000 women. It\u2019s unique in that it is split into two wings, with social services on one side and a fully functioning police station on the other. There is a 24-hour law-enforcement presence and various entrances into the mirrored structure so that those on the outside cannot see in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the social services side, there are offices and resources from a plethora of partner organizations\u2014including the Association of Black Psychologists, Planned Parenthood, the Summer Youth Employment program and RZ the Flags\u2014as well as full-time staff from rape and sexual assault and HIV-education organizations. The center also boasts a doctor\u2019s office, a safe space for the LGBTQ community, and grief and trauma counseling. The police side houses the entire city\u2019s domestic violence, sexual assault, missing-persons, elder-abuse, bias-crimes and human trafficking divisions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsia Smith, of the center\u2019s Domestic Violence Response Team, says that her team works very closely with law enforcement to bridge the divide that exists between police and many communities of color. \u201cWe\u2019re able to make [victim-survivors] feel a lot more comfortable about speaking with the officers, the majority of whom are women, ironically,\u201d Smith says.\n\n\u201cWe had a woman who came in today who was strangled,\u201d says Smith, who noted that all it takes is 4 pounds of pressure to die by choking.\n\n\u201cShe was threatened with a weapon and was very shaken up,\u201d Smith adds. \u201cOnce she came into the center, we allowed her to speak with one of the officers and to ascertain a statement. Then she came over to the social services side and really began to open up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe discovered that her needs extended far beyond her situation today,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThis young lady is going to have to come back repeatedly. So it\u2019s more of a holistic approach that we take for victim-survivors. I think it makes the officers\u2019 lives much easier because they can\u2019t devote but so much time to an individual, but they really want to do more. We can be an extension of what they do.\u201d\n\nA few years after Shani Baraka\u2019s death, Ras Baraka dedicated a book of poetry, Black Girls Learn Love Hard (Moore Black Press), to her. He still laments how intimate-partner violence ripped through the fabric of his close-knit social network, way beyond the two people involved.\n\n\u201cIt was a community problem,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cBoth families knew each other. It caused a lot of tension in our neighborhood, and obviously a lot of grief in our family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Baraka says that the flip side of that is having familiar faces in the community take care of one another. He sees the center as an accomplishment of that as well as a semblance of closure.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt gave me the opportunity to do something because it felt like I did nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hopeless in the whole situation. And you always feel like you have to protect your sister and the women in your family, and then you realize that we have to empower women to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLearn more about the Shani Baraka Women\u2019s Resource Center below:", "keywords": ["mayor", "violence", "baraka", "sister", "center", "women", "community", "haven", "inspired", "nj", "shani", "team", "tragedy", "smith", "family", "ras", "newark", "survivors", "black"], "polarity": 0.05779617329235651, "subjectivity": 0.41016754238128295},

Because of his celebrity, though, Brown will never truly go away. Still, with his most recent disturbing headline, it\u2019s time to internalize En Vogue\u2019s \u201cGive It Up, Turn It Loose.\u201d We\u2019ll always have \u201cYo (Excuse Me Miss),\u201d \u201cTake You Down,\u201d \u201cDamage\u201d and \u201cFine China,\u201d but for those who continue to hold out hope that Brown will rise above his problems, it\u2019s time to pop, lock and drop into reality.\n\nOn Tuesday, TMZ reported that Brown\u2019s former girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed legal documents accusing Brown of threatening to kill her. Additionally, Tran claims that Brown has physically assaulted her in the past. And suddenly I now want to get up and do Soulja Boy\u2019s Superman dance.\n\nPer TMZ:\n\nKarrueche claims in a sworn statement to the judge, earlier this month Chris \u201ctold a few people that he was going to kill me.\u201d She then says Chris told the friends if he can\u2019t have her then no one else can, threatening he was going to \u201ctake me out\u201d and \u201cthreatened to shoot me.\u201d Karrueche also says several years ago Chris \u201cpunched me in my stomach twice,\u201d and \u201cpushed me down the stairs.\u201d This would have been during the time Chris was on probation for the Rihanna beating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTran also claims that Brown has threatened her friends and recently threw a drink at one of them. So, not only is this man Light, Bright Ike, but he\u2019s part-time vintage Evelyn Lozada from Basketball Wives.\n\nIn any case, the judge granted said domestic violence restraining order, requiring Brown to stay 100 yards away from Tran, her mom and her brother.\n\nIn response, Brown took to Instagram to try to clear his name while simultaneously confirming your worst suspicions about his state of mind as he rambled rather incoherently. Forgoing a publicist and lawyer, Brown said, \u201cMake sure y\u2019all don\u2019t be listening to all this bullshit man. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about. Don\u2019t believe all that bullshit, bro.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis comments might have come across as more convincing had he not delivered them in a manner that recalls a kite flying high in the clear blue sky.\n\n\n\nOf the many problems Chris Brown has, one in particular is his unfortunate habit of documenting his bad decisions and erratic behavior for all to see. Less than a month ago, Brown took to Al Gore\u2019s internet and recorded himself sounding like the very violent menace his ex-girlfriend is accusing him to be. Do people not realize that when it comes to sharing videos on the internet, 1) we can see you and 2) the internet is forever?\n\nIn that now infamous clip in which he looked like the lost cousin of Kris Kross, Brown said:\n\n\n\nLadies y\u2019all be complaining about niggas being like stalkers, in love with y\u2019all, kinda crazy shit, and get tired of \u2019em. Well guess what? I\u2019m one of them niggas. If I love you, bitch, ain\u2019t nobody gon\u2019 have ya. I\u2019mma make ya miserable. I\u2019mma chase that nigga out, I\u2019mma chase yo ass around. Ladies, y\u2019all ever dealt with a nigga who just be blowin\u2019 your shit up? Hopping gates, stalking the fuck out of you, getting on your nerves? Well, shit. I\u2019m one of them niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now he is being accused not only of additional physical abuse years after he beat another now-former girlfriend, Rihanna, but also of living up to the very abusive stalker he boldly professed himself to be on camera.\n\nFor years now, fans and other sympathizers have rallied behind Brown. Some have made excuses for his behavior. In many cases it was a matter of victim-blaming, though in others, Brown\u2019s having witnessed domestic violence as a child was cited as a reason to hold out hope that he would one day get himself together. That he would own his mistakes and ultimately overcome whatever internal demons and the childhood trauma that helped create them.\n\n\n\nBut as someone who is not unfamiliar with some of what Brown has spoken of previously, there comes a point when you realize that some people are simply stuck. Maybe critics\u2014self included\u2014were too harsh on him. Perhaps more people needed to give him a chance to redeem himself. There were instances in which it seemed as if Brown was damned if he did, damned if he didn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, Brown has largely been the maker of his own madness.\n\nChris Brown never let go of the misogyny. In fact, he continued to profit from it in his music. Chris Brown remained defensive more often than not about his repeating the very cycle of abuse he was exposed to as a kid. Chris Brown never stopped battling people, be it online or in person. Chris Brown has exhibited violence for several years.\n\nBrown is a man of means; he has refused to use his blessings to become a better, happier and less terrorizing man. Brown can call Karrueche Tran\u2019s accusations \u201cbullshit,\u201d but he\u2019s given us countless examples of why we should believe every single thing she told that judge. Even now, I can recall the sight of Brown following Tran outside a club in 2015\u2014which at the time was reported to have resulted in an argument.\n\n\n\nLook at him. Look at her. Look at the fear in her eyes. Look at the traits of an abuser on full display without the slightest sign of shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what will become of Brown, but I do know that not a song in the world can excuse him anymore. Whatever emotional attachment people have to him because of his work, it is not enough when considering that he is on camera boasting about stalking someone for no other reason than her rightly deciding that he doesn\u2019t deserve her.\n\nBrown\u2019s debut album was released in 2005. We learned that he beat women in 2009. Seven years later, he\u2019s being accused of the same thing, and throughout these seven years, he has shown himself to be more like Eddie from The Five Heartbeats than Michael from the Jackson 5. Let him go.\n\n\n\nIf anything, now is the time to focus less on Brown\u2019s dedication to self-destruction and more on the havoc he brings to others who enter his space.\n\n", "keywords": ["chris", "acting", "refuses", "man", "violence", "shit", "ike", "bright", "turner", "tran", "told", "yall", "brown", "light", "look", "dont", "stop"], "polarity": 0.01653374711708045, "subjectivity": 0.48321102971102975},

Actually, he wasn\u2019t yet a man; he was 13, an eighth-grader to my sixth. And we weren\u2019t fighting, or even roughhousing. We were rehearsing for a school play when he abruptly asked me to be his girlfriend.\n\n\n\nEmbarrassed and incredulous, I laughed and said, \u201cNo!\u201d (I was 11, after all). Then I watched his face contort in anger, just before he coldcocked me. Twice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember how everything went white for a moment and how I grabbed the edge of the stage to steady myself. When I opened my eyes, our drama teacher, a black parent who ran drama club as part of our after-school curriculum, was standing between the boy and me. After ensuring that I wasn\u2019t bleeding or broken anywhere, she assured me that he was sorry and made him apologize. Then she asked me to apologize, too. After all, I\u2019d laughed at him.\n\nIn that moment, I was made to understand that I was, at least in part, responsible for his actions. His wounded pride was of equal priority to\u2014if not higher than\u2014my safety. My forgiveness was instantly expected, and we were to proceed as if nothing had happened. And we did.\n\nIt would be years before I learned that my drama teacher\u2019s husband was known to raise a hand or two of his own. But most significantly, I remember feeling that I\u2019d experienced some sick rite of passage, and that it likely wouldn\u2019t be the last time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was made to understand that I was, at least in part, responsible for his actions.\n\nAt 21, and a senior in college, I began my first and only cohabiting relationship. It seemed that my life was beginning to come together: Within months I had the degree; the Brooklyn, N.Y., brownstone duplex; the burgeoning career; and the man I expected to be my future husband. All that was left was to add two kids and stir.\n\nWe had a passionate relationship. That was the word I always used: \u201cpassionate.\u201d With limited experience in either adulthood or adult relationships, I thought that level of passion meant ours was a love worth fighting for\u2014literally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so deeply in love, I dismissed the stories of his last relationship, nodding in agreement when he called his ex-girlfriend \u201ccrazy.\u201d I imagined how she undoubtedly provoked him when he remorsefully admitted to once \u201cshoving\u201d her, and considered her vengeful for calling the cops on him. I self-righteously assumed that she\u2019d been the poison in their toxic relationship, even while cringing at his increasingly harsher criticisms and controlling behavior.\n\nEven when he \u201cshoved\u201d me the first time\u2014into a wall, after dragging me up the stoop of our brownstone by my collar when I\u2019d tried to leave, ripping my jacket almost in two\u2014my mind spun less from the impact than from frantically trying to figure out how to fix our relationship. How small could I shrink to fix us?\n\nBesides, I didn\u2019t fit any of the clich\u00e9s of an \u201cabused woman.\u201d In fact, the closest I\u2019d ever been to witnessing violence in my childhood home was overhearing the terrifying screams and thuds of the neighbors upstairs, who my mother gently explained were \u201cmoving furniture\u201d before she called the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now we were the neighbors whose screams were heard through the wall, the spectacle on the front steps of our home as passersby stared on in horror. I\u2019d just graduated from a progressive, woman-centric college, fully convinced of my rights and autonomy. And yet the next time would find me with the hand of the man I loved clenched around my neck as he threatened to bash my face in if I fought back. Clich\u00e9s be damned. How small could I shrink?\n\nThis is the memory that instantly came to mind when I read the results of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s latest report, \u201cRacial and Ethnic Differences in Homicides of Adult Women and the Role of Intimate Partner Violence.\u201d Unsurprisingly (to me, at least), the CDC\u2019s findings revealed that over half of female homicide victims between the ages of 18 and 44 are killed by intimate partners. Also not surprising: Non-Hispanic black women are killed at almost three times the rate of their white counterparts\u2014the highest rate of all ethnicities, as a matter of fact. And 98 percent of those homicides are committed by men.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo more years would pass before I left that relationship\u2014even longer before I would readily identify it as abuse, and confess it to friends and family. By that time, he\u2019d bedded and moved in with the neighbor who lived directly above the apartment we once shared, and I was filing dozens of Affidavit of Forgery forms to dispute a series of fraudulent checks that bore my name but, suspiciously, his bank and branch. (Did I mention that he was a graphic designer\u2014and that financial abuse is a form of domestic abuse, too?)\n\nWhat are we going to do about the black girls who are told long before they even have an intimate partner that their safety isn\u2019t paramount?\n\nThe CDC study cites \u201cargument and jealousy\u201d as \u201ccommon precipitating circumstances.\u201d As a remedy, it suggests \u201ctargeted [intimate-partner violence] prevention programs for populations at disproportionate risk and enhanced access to intervention services for persons experiencing IPV are needed to reduce homicides among women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure. But specifically, what are we going to do about the black girls who are told long before they even have an intimate partner that their safety isn\u2019t paramount? And what about the black boys who are being taught\u2014along with the rest of the world\u2014that black girls are of ultimately less value? As one Georgetown University study found (pdf), there is the perception that black girls \u201cneed less nurturing; less protection; to be supported less; to be comforted less; are more independent; know more about adult topics; know more about sex.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does that say about the perception of their worth?\n\nAs we saw with the emergence of yet another R. Kelly scandal last week\u2014and the inevitable chorus of those who incessantly cape for \u201cthe Pied Piper\u201d\u2014there is an almost pathological undervaluing of the lives of black girls and women in America. (How else do you explain allowing a predator to thrive in our midst for over two decades?)\n\nDespite ample evidence of #BlackGirlMagic and annual proclamations that Black Girls Rock!, when it comes to making black lives matter, the lost lives of black men are still generally the ones that take precedence in that discussion. And yet, the CDC suggests that 55 percent of murdered black women\u2014women who still overwhelming choose partners within their race\u2014will be killed by the black men they presumably love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven this evidence, it seems that we have two options: Believe that black men are inherently more violent, or believe that the lives of black women are inherently less valued. And while I refuse to accept the former as truth, there is evidence far beyond Georgetown\u2019s or the CDC\u2019s findings to support the latter. The truth is, how we talk to and about black women matters.\n\nWhen we talk about how patriarchy and misogynoir function even among those who, as Jamilah Lemieux wrote, \u201care black, who were raised by black women and profess to value black people,\u201d we rarely tell the origin stories. We don\u2019t discuss how a \u201cride or die\u201d mentality is often ingrained in our daughters before they ever learn the phrase. Or how our blind allegiances encourage our sons to value black women\u2019s loyalty more than black women\u2019s lives.\n\nI never told my parents about the first time I was hit. Not because I thought I wouldn\u2019t be believed, but because even at 11, I understood that I was to protect this boy, even above myself. It was my first experience of shrinking to fix a problem that wasn\u2019t mine. And as predicted, it wasn\u2019t my last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause all too often, this is the measure of a woman\u2019s worth: We ride for our men, even when at risk of dying at their hands. What are we going to do about that?\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by domestic violence, please contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233\n\n6", "keywords": ["partner", "man", "violence", "men", "value", "know", "women", "intimate", "girls", "devils", "wasnt", "lives", "dancing", "report", "id", "relationship", "black", "tells"], "polarity": 0.016976002999625053, "subjectivity": 0.41205161854768135},

I've noticed some repetitive counterarguments that often derail otherwise substantive conversations. I mean, that is the point, isn't it?\n\nI rounded up a few of the most frequent (and illogical) ways uncomfortable (or sadistic) commenters ruin productive discussions:\n\n\n\n1. \"Why now?\"\n\nThis is the go-to line for Bill Cosby apologists and Parker defenders. They want to know why Cosby's accusers came forward after decades of silence. Or why Parker's rape trial is being discussed now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I just want to know, \"Why not now?\" You can't be charged with certain alleged crimes after a certain amount of time, but we can't discuss them, either, even when the story is currently in the news cycle? Even when a celebrity sits for interviews about his misdeeds? Should we all consult our calendars for an undefined expiration date before caring or commenting?\n\nIf an alleged victim doesn't speak up immediately, then she should take it to her grave? Is that how this works? If a heinous crime is alleged to have taken place and there's been no past accountability, is time a get-out-of-anyone-having-an-opinion free card?\n\nSomeone let me know. I'm confused.\n\n\n\n2. \"But white people allow it/don't do \u2026 \"\n\nWhite people are not the gold standard. I repeat: White people are not the gold standard. That there are moviegoers who turn a blind eye to Woody Allen or Roman Polanski, or who separate the man from his work of art, isn't a valid reason for black people to look past the shenanigans or crimes allegedly or actually committed by another black person. We ain't gotta \"follow the leader.\" We can think independently and hold black folk accountable when necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"Don't judge/Only God can judge.\"\n\nOut of all the responses, this one irritates me the most. To judge, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is to form an opinion or draw a conclusion. We all judge. All of us. All the time. And that includes the \"Don't judge\" people. They just can't articulate a proper argument to defend their point of view, or they're guilty of similar behavior. Instead of admitting that, they get on the moral high horse and try to shame into silence folks who are using their brains. It's sooooo annoying, but rarely works.\n\n\n\n4. \"There are more important topics, like \u2026 \"\n\nIn fairness, discussing the fit or pattern of Cam Newton's pants doesn't compare, in terms of importance, to, say, poverty, racism or rape. But if you see that's the topic of discussion and you think it's wack, why didn't you keep scrolling?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yes, folks can discuss Cam's pants one minute and #BlackLivesMatter the next. It's not as if folks get one opinion a day and they've wasted it frivolously on fashion.\n\nThis argument is even worse when folks actually are discussing an important topic such as racism or sexism or rape, and someone jumps in to say they should be talking about something else. Without fail, when folks are discussing police brutality, there's always someone who wants the whole discussion to cease and switch to \u201cblack-on-black\u201d crime. Women discussing sexism or rape? There's always that one person who jumps in wanting to talk about black folk uniting to fight the Man instead.\n\nYou passionately feel what you want to talk about needs a voice? Start your own #hashtag or thread so you can be heard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \"Y\u2019all just hating.\"\n\nNow, sometimes this one is appropriate, such as when you stumble upon a thread discussing the state of Gabrielle Douglas' hair while she is competing. Other times, this is thrown out because the commenter has a lack of anything intelligent to add to the conversation and a desire to invalidate all naysayers. To quote the great street prophet Common, \"If I don't like it, I don't like it/Doesn't mean that I'm hating.\" If you like something and the person or group you're engaging with doesn't, just state your support and your reasons for enjoying. Or even better, keep scrolling.\n\n\n\n6. \"It's a conspiracy \u2026 \"\n\nThis one drives me nuts, too, but it actually holds some weight right now. That girl who said Chris Brown pulled a gun on her and she had to run for her life, I mean, after she got her phone back? She wasn't in collusion with the feds to take down Brown, but that situation sounds more and more like a setup. Y\u2019all won this round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I still want to say this: Your favorite celeb who suddenly has been humbled and dragged probably isn't the victim of a conspiracy. It's more likely that a series of bad decisions finally caught up with him or her, and it's harder to bury a story in the age of social media and blogs.\n\n\n\n7. \"It's the woman's fault \u2026 \"\n\nSadly, I've come to expect this from men and women alike when it comes to any form of abuse happening to a woman. But the frequency of this argument and how some folk will apply it to just any situation just baffles me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was part of a conversation recently about the \"media's emasculation of black men\" as inspired by Yung Joc's permed hair and Young Thug's album cover. I don't get the rationale, but I read through the comments to understand the perspective. I stopped when I got to a guy blaming man-perms and men in dresses on women. Apparently, women like and encourage these expressions, and men want to attract women, so if women didn't encourage it, men wouldn't do this.\n\nHuh? Young Thug wants to dress up like Scarlett O'Hara and that's my fault? Naw. That grown man decided to wear that dress. And if he's happy in it, I'm happy for him. But wearing that dress is solely on him.\n\nI find often that it's the most \"I am man, hear me roar, let me lead\"-type guys that refuse to hold other men accountable for anything. It's always, \"A woman made him do it.\" And I always wonder if they realize how weak it makes men sound. Like, if everything you do is because of a woman, you're a follower. Just get out the way, stop yelling about submission, and just let the folks who are already leading go on and do what they do without all the complaining.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus: \"You're a Negro bed wench.\"\n\nThis one is reserved for black women who dare to call themselves feminists and/or use words like \"privilege\" and \"misogynoir\" and/or don't rush to defend black men who have found themselves in a media scandal. if you believed the 60 women who accused Cosby of nefarious sexual conduct, thought Nate Parker was anything less than completely innocent or have expressed an unwillingness to attend an R. Kelly concert, you may have found this comment in your social media mentions.\n\nThis is a clear sign of a person who hates black women. There is no reasoning with the speaker, usually a man. Just block and report him for harassment. You're probably not the first person to whom he's said it. Maybe with enough complaints, the social media platform will ban his account and you'll be the last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemetria Lucas D\u2019Oyley is a contributing editor at The Root, a life coach and the author of Don\u2019t Waste Your Pretty: The Go-to Guide for Making Smarter Decisions in Life & Love as well as A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-to Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Single Life.

That's the answer you're going to give? You're going to sit up here and pretend that Kyrie isn't your favorite player in the league, and that you haven't been writing about him since 2012?\n\nI didn't think that was relevant information today.\n\nWhatever, man. Anyway, who is Kehlani?\n\nKehlani is a young woman who, apparently, sings songs. I wish I had more to tell you about the names of her songs or perhaps the types of songs she sings, but I'd have to google it. Which means you'd find out just as quickly as I would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, who is PartyNextDoor?\n\nPartyNextDoor could literally be performing right now at a party next door \u2014 with a note on my door letting me know PartyNextDoor will be at a party next door this morning \u2014 and I still wouldn't know who he was. I'd just be annoyed my neighbors were having a party at 11am.\n\nSo\u2026you get paid to follow and write about pop culture, right?\n\nI do.\n\nAnd you don't know who these people are?\n\nI don't. I'm not going to lie and say that I do. Have I heard the names \"Kehlani\" and \"PartyNextDoor\" before? Yes I have. Do I know why these are names I've heard before? No I don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, who is Chris Brown?\n\nChris Brown is light-skinned.\n\nWhy are we talking about them today?\n\nWell, my entry point into all of this came Monday afternoon, when I noticed Kyrie's name was the top trending topic. This immediately sent a chill through my spine, because if an athlete's name is trending while there are no games being played, it's usually because something bad happened to him. An arrest, perhaps. Or maybe a drug suspension. And, knowing what I know about Kyrie's extensive (and annoyingly random) injury history, my first fear was that he contracted knee AIDS or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnee AIDS? Really?\n\nLook, this is a dude who broke his toe in college while making a cut, broke his hand the summer after his rookie season slapping a wall, and broke his kneecap last summer after bumping into a guy who's literally made out of water. Knee AIDS isn't really that far-fetched.\n\nAnyway, he was actually trending because Kehlani \u2014 who Kyrie was apparently dating \u2014 was apparently cheating on him. And the internet decided to have quite a bit of fun at Kyrie's expense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait\u2026how did the internet find out about Kehlani's alleged infidelity?\n\nPartyNextDoor \u2014 who happened to be Kehlani's ex \u2014 posted a photo on Instagram of them in bed together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. Well, why do you keep using words like \"apparently\" and \"alleged?\" Everything seems pretty clear here. Kyrie was dating a woman (Kehlani) who cheated on him with her ex (PartyNextDoor). The ex provided photo evidence. There's not much ambiguity here.\n\nActually, there is. We have no idea whether Kyrie and Kehlani were still seeing each other. Although their relationship was public, it's very possible that they broke up privately. The only person definitely in the wrong here is PartyNextDoor.\n\nHow so?\n\nWhether Kehlani and Kyrie were actually still dating or not, people who knew of the relationship assumed they were. And sharing a photo like that is the pinnacle of passive-aggressive fuckboytivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich, to be fair, shouldn't have been a big surprise.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause he's an OVO artist. And OVO is Drake's label. And Drake is the patron saint of passive-aggressive fuckboytivity. Ultimately, PartyNextDoor was just acting out what happens in literally every single Drake verse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nAyesha Curry's name started trending. Again.\n\nWait\u2026what? Why the hell did that happen?\n\nBecause whenever a young and famous Black man who is dating a woman experiences any type of relationship-related adversity, Ayesha Curry's name is dropped as an example of the \"type of female these thoterrific bitches need to be.\" As I tweeted Monday evening, she's the Hotep Twitter Candyman. Say her name in the mirror five times and ashy elbows will appear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what happened after that?\n\nThings got a quite a bit more serious early Tuesday as Kehlani shared a photo of her in a hospital room, with a caption suggesting she attempted to commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow. That's really sad.\n\nIt is. And the sadness turned surreal when #StayStrongKehlani became the top trending topic just hours after she was getting shaded by every corner of the internet. Which is like wearing a RIP shirt to honor someone you just shot. There's a cognitive dissonance that seems to exist within internet shade culture. Yes, the memes can be funny and clever, but I think we forget sometimes that there are actual people at the receiving end of these jokes. Actual people who could be so upset by it that they're driven to the type of depression that makes them consider ending their own lives.\n\nSo, I noticed Chris Brown's name is in the title. How did he get involved with all of this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Brown tweeted that he believed Kehlani's suicide attempt was an inauthentic ploy for attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would Chris Brown even feel the need to chime in here?\n\nAsking why Chris Brown does what Chris Brown does is like asking my four-month-old daughter why she smiles at clocks. It's like he has a timer that goes off every six months to remind him to remind us he's a 26-year-old six-year-old. If Drake is the patron saint of passive-aggressive but relatively harmless fuckboytivity, Chris Brown is fuckboy emertus.\n\nI do know however that Chris Brown and Kyrie Irving are apparently good friends. And that, considering the history between Chris Brown and Drake, he's probably not too fond of Drake-related artists. So there's that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I have to admit something. It seemed kind of fishy for Kehlani to share a photo of herself in the hospital after her suicide attempt. I know listening to Chris Brown is like listening to a genital wart, but I think he has a point here.\n\nWas Chris Brown the only person to be a bit skeptical about how genuine Kehlani's suicide attempt was? No, he wasn't. But we don't know what's going on in that young woman's head. None of us do. And when something as serious as suicide is on the table, we have to give her the benefit of the doubt. If there's even a 1% chance she's sincere, it needs to be treated like a 100% chance.\n\nSaying someone faked a suicide attempt and questioning their authenticity is ultimately an implicit way of daring them to try again. And someone as famous as Chris Brown doing it with the ginormous platform he has is dangerous, disgusting, and possibly even criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, \"seeking attention\" and \"being suicidal\" are qualities that can exist at the same time. The presence of one doesn't negate the presence of the other. Perhaps she did share that picture to elicit sympathy, but that doesn't mean she didn't legitimately want to kill herself.\n\nGenerally speaking, we don't know shit about mental health. And the conversations that tend to surround these types of topics are examples of that.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nI have no idea. All I do know is that these are all exceedingly young people. Kyrie just turned 24. Kehlani is 20. PartyNextDoor is 22. Chris Brown is 26. And I do not envy the generation who has to go through their teens and 20s \u2014 and all the perfectly normal relationship-related fuckshit that occurs when you're a teenager and a young adult \u2014 with every move they make documented on social media.", "keywords": ["wtf", "chris", "trending", "suicide", "irving", "partynextdoor", "kyrie", "know", "kehlani", "explained", "young", "apparently", "brown", "going"], "polarity": 0.05739247311827955, "subjectivity": 0.4823284690220173}
