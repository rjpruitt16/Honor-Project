A recent trade acquisition from the Arizona Coyotes, Rieder had celebrated Germany\u2019s upset of Canada in the Olympic semifinals by wearing a gold jersey at practice on Friday, along with red tape on his black socks to mimic the German flag.\n\nBefore the Kings took the ice against the Oilers, he had expressed excitement for the gold medal matchup, even if he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what time the final started. \u201cI thought they played at four in the morning,\u201d he said, inadvertently acknowledging a halfhearted interest shared by some fans.\n\n\u201cIf I came across it when it was on, I would watch it,\u201d the Kings fan Blaine Yanabu said, adding, \u201cFor the most part it wasn\u2019t as exciting because N.H.L. players weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nYanabu admitted he was unaware that the Olympic gold medal game was taking place around the same time the Kings were to play the Oilers, or even which two countries were playing for the gold.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe was, however, still buzzing about the women\u2019s Olympic ice hockey final on Wednesday, in which the United States captured its first gold medal in the event since 1998 with a shootout victory over archrival Canada.\n\nNBC announced that 2.9 million viewers had watched that showdown, making it the most-watched late-night program in the history of NBC Sports Network. The figure was a marked decrease from the 4.9 million viewers who watched the same matchup in the 2014 gold medal game at the 2014 Sochi Games, which was broadcast on NBC \u2014 though the 2014 final began at noon Eastern time, while this year\u2019s gold medal game began at 11 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViewership for this year\u2019s Olympic men\u2019s tournament saw a similar decline. The United States men\u2019s eight-round shootout victory over Russia in the 2014 Sochi Games established a record at the time for a hockey game on NBCSN, with 4.1 million viewers. But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number, a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches \u2014 and others \u2014 from tuning in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Image Kim Yong-nam, the nominal head of state of North Korea, and Kim Yo-jong, sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, looking on behind President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and his wife, Kim Jung-sook, during the Olympic opening ceremony on Feb. 9. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has worked hard to be a matchmaker in this month\u2019s Winter Olympics, getting North and South Korea to march together in the opening ceremony and tirelessly urging visiting dignitaries from the North and the United States to talk.\n\nBut as the 16-day Games end on Sunday and the Olympic euphoria wears off, Mr. Moon may find the hard part of managing these relationships is just beginning.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Moon scored a potential diplomatic breakthrough when Kim Yong-chol, a senior North Korean official attending the closing ceremony, said the North was willing to open dialogue with the United States.\n\nIt was unclear whether Mr. Kim attached any preconditions. After Vice President Mike Pence met with the South\u2019s leader this month, American officials said they were open to holding preliminary talks with North Korea \u2014 but only to reassert their position that sanctions and pressure will not let up until the North starts denuclearizing.\n\nMoon will face some tough choices as he tries to accomplish two goals, building on a hard-won Olympic d\u00e9tente with North Korea while also preventing a rupture with the Trump administration, which is raising the pressure on the North to give up its nuclear weapons. He also wants to pursue his own agenda of taking a leading role in defusing tensions around the Korean Peninsula, which remains technically at war.\n\nMr. Moon may see an opportunity in the surprise offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, conveyed in person by Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, to hold their first summit meeting in Pyongyang. Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nImage Ivanka Trump watching the men\u2019s big air snowboard event in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Saturday with Kim Jung-sook, the country\u2019s first lady, and Kang Kyung-wha, the foreign minister. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt dramatically lowered the pitch of tension on the Korean Peninsula, replacing tests, threats and tweets with face-to-face talks, and it restored Seoul as a key player in the game,\u201d said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul.\n\nThe question, Mr. Delury said, is the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to let South Korea be a mediator with the North, especially as expectations in Washington have dwindled that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, can persuade the North to disarm.\n\nSome Trump administration officials said the United States had to accept that there was now a viable diplomatic channel between North and South Korea, and figure out how to use it for American goals. The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nImage Supporters of the unified Korean team waiting for players in Gangneung, South Korea, on Feb. 10. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.\n\nChoe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Motoko Rich from Gangneung, South Korea.

Credit Antonio Bat/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nVictor Mather: Four years ago, Norway had by all accounts a screamingly successful Winter Olympics, but failed to win the events it treasures the most: the cross country relays. Indeed, Norway failed even to win a medal, placing fourth in the men\u2019s race and fifth in the women\u2019s.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.\n\nBut Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.\n\nThen she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)\n\nAnd the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.\n\nFor good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again.\n\nImage Adam Rippon in the men's free skate.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Voice That Soared\n\nKaren Crouse: Mixed zones, those areas where reporters descend on athletes immediately after they\u2019re done competing, are seldom places of high profundity. Imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. But then along came the walking book of quotations known as Adam Rippon, whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.\n\nRippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. After his free skate in the men\u2019s singles, Rippon, one of two openly gay men on the United States Olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don\u2019t embrace him.\n\n\u201cHaters are just fans in denial,\u201d Rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.\n\nImage Xu Mengtao of China during the women's aerials. She did not reach the medal round. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nWhen Olympic Stars Twinkle Overhead\n\nJames Hill: One night during the first week of competition, I had the chance to photograph the women\u2019s aerials finals at Phoenix Snow Park.\n\nIt was my first visit to the venue, and the photo manager told me that during practice he allowed photographers to stand underneath the ramp off which the skiers launch themselves. Normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. This vantage point gave an entirely different view.\n\nOne cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.\n\nAs they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.\n\nImage Jingyu Lee and Yoonjung Park of the unified Korean hockey team took a lap around the ice after their final game of the Olympics. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\n\u2018We Are One!\u2019\n\nMotoko Rich: Losing all five of its games, the unified Korea women\u2019s ice hockey team was pretty battered, not just on the ice, but by intense political and news media attention. Yet after the team\u2019s final game, against Sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, \u201cWe are one!\u201d\n\nThen the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 Seoul Games, \u201cHand in Hand,\u201d blared across the arena. The last player on the ice was goalie Shin So-jung, who let in four goals that night. She left to a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nImage Choi Min-jeong of South Korea after winning the 1,500-meter short-track speedskating race. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nInescapable Speedskating\n\nJohn Branch: The first night of short-track speedskating was a hoot, an arena bursting with energy and a crowd of knowledgeable fans cheering one of South Korea\u2019s favorite sports.\n\nBut you did not have to be in the arena to understand what short track means to the host country. During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman. She was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.\n\nImage Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany after their stunning long program. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Perfect Comeback\n\nJere Longman: Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany, who were among the favorites in the pairs figure skating competition, fell to fourth after the short program when Massot made a jumping mistake. He seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.\n\nBut they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.\n\nUntil November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games. Massot later confessed to a friend, \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand everything he said.\u201d\n\nImage Ivett Toth during her sizzling, and chilly, tribute to AC/DC. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Biker on Ice, a Skater on the Edge\n\nJuliet Macur: After just a couple beats of the music playing in the Gangneung Ice Arena, I knew Ivett Toth of Hungary wasn\u2019t skating to the same old songs. Nothing from \u201cCarmen\u201d or \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Not one of those go-to figure skating songs that I\u2019d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first Winter Games in 2002.\n\nThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.\n\nHer music had the rafters shaking. It was AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d and Toth was dressed as a biker. She wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of AC/DC\u2019s lead guitarist, Angus Young, on the back. She also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. It was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.\n\nAs the music suggested, Toth rocked it. Half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d a staple of N.F.L. games. The other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. I swear that I could see the judges growing pale.\n\nToth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.\n\nWhen Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201d\n\nImage Joe Ward, left, with Doug Mills, whom he calls one of his \"heroes.\" Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Going to Be a Good Morning\u2019\n\nJoe Ward: Anytime you can start your workday on a chairlift with the Pulitzer Prize-winning White House photographer Doug Mills, you know it\u2019s going to be a good morning. Wind chills of minus-20 and gusts of 60 m.p.h. only make the experience of working alongside one of your journalistic heroes all the more memorable.\n\nDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor. Some days, more than others, you realize you\u2019re lucky to be doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nImage Artur Nogal of Poland falling painfully early in the speedskating sprint. Credit John Sibley/Reuters\n\nAn Athlete Falls, and Applause Rises\n\nDavid Segal: If Poland\u2019s Artur Nogal ever has grandchildren and wants to tell them about his Olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.\n\nIf records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.\n\nImage Family and fans of Anna Gasser of Austria celebrate her win in the women's Big Air snowboarding final. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nA Visual Cue From the Roar of the Crowd\n\nBedel Saget: As a visual journalist, I find it interesting that my favorite moment of the Pyeongchang Games was a strictly audible one. For the women\u2019s big air final, I was shooting from a position where I could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (Ask the silver medalist, Jamie Anderson, who couldn\u2019t hold onto first place after failing to land her \u201ccab double cork 1080\u201d in the final round.)\n\nI followed as best as I could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. By the third and final round, I had a strong feeling that the Austrian Anna Gasser \u2014 the reigning world champion and favorite whom I\u2019d followed for an entire year for one of our Olympic preview interactive graphics \u2014 would land somewhere on the podium.\n\nThe stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.\n\nImage Vice President Mike Pence of the United States and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea shared a laugh at the women's 500 meters short-track speedskating race. Credit Julie Jacobson/Associated Press\n\nA Night of Geopolitics, and Gold\n\nRandal C. Archibold: In one night, I saw South Korea win its first gold medal, Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage push past me, and the North Korean cheerleading squad execute \u201cthe wave\u201d with robotic precision.\n\nWho knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?\n\nIt was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.\n\nImage Who let this guy come to the top of the jump?

This is a place I had never visited while photographing several other Games, and I had not seen many photos made from inside.\n\nI would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.\n\nImage \"As long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the Norwegian men at the train station.

They were covered in Norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their Viking plushies.\n\nI gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.\n\nI snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\n\n\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201d\n\nThe first Olympics I remember watching were the Nagano Games in 1998. As a child, I was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. Now, 20 years later, I was in the country of my parents\u2019 birth to cover my first Olympics. I have always felt a bit like an outsider \u2014 a minority at home or a foreigner with an American accent here. But that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to Korea, the world felt a little smaller. I thanked the Norwegians, and we parted ways.\n\n\n\nImage At the finish of the team sprint, Jessie Diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for Team U.S.A., clinching its first gold in cross country. Credit Dmitri Lovetsky/Associated Press\n\nBecause Minnesota\n\nTalya Minsberg: \u201cBecause Minnesota.\u201d That\u2019s a reason I was assigned to follow the United States women\u2019s cross country team throughout the Winter Games. Both Jessie Diggins and I grew up in Minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the Twin Cities.\n\nDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.\n\nOn Feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. On Feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. Two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just 3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. And when the stands were the fullest, on Feb. 17, the American team of Sophie Caldwell, Sadie Bjornsen, Kikkan Randall and Diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.\n\nWhen asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so many narrow misses, Diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201d\n\nThe race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in Olympic highlight reels for years. Diggins and Randall didn\u2019t just win a medal. They took the gold.\n\n\n\nImage The Pyeongchang crowds approached the Olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nSome of the Best Pictures Are Not of Athletes\n\nHilary Swift: One of my favorite days at the Olympics was the qualifying runs for women\u2019s big air snowboarding. It was probably the warmest day I can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.\n\nMy colleague Doug Mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so I was free to roam the crowd and look for features. To me, this photo speaks to what the Olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. You may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you\u2019re supporting your country\u2019s athletes and others from all over the world.\n\nImage The media buses at the Olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the Games. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nPardon the Delay While My Country Races\n\nAndrew Keh: A bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last Sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.\n\nRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.\n\nBus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\n\nTwo days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the South Korean women\u2019s curling win over the United States team. Some passengers clapped as the women, unexpected stars of the Games, celebrated on screen. The driver laughed out loud.\n\n\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.\n\nImage Michelle Gisin of Switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the Alpine combined a few days later. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nExceptional on the Slopes, Normal on the Bus\n\nTara Parker-Pope: For me, the best part of the Olympics happened between competitions, when I would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. I struck up a conversation with the Swiss skier Michelle Gisin on a bus \u2014 about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister Dominique won a gold medal in Sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.\n\nGisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing exceptional things.\n\nImage Two old friends, Matthew Futterman, left, and Jason Albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day. Credit Gabby Naranja\n\nIs That You, Jason?\n\nMatthew Futterman: The Olympic Games are supposed to be about bringing people together.\n\nAs a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?\n\nWe spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating problems large and small \u2014 Iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.\n\nOn graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nThe day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.\n\nIn that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.\n\nImage From left to right, Mina Kim, Robert Fissel and the brothers Keun Hwan and Dong-hyung Lee taking in a bobsled race. \"It's so fast,\" Dong-hyung Lee said. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nThe Best Bobsled Picture Has No Bobsled\n\nChang W. Lee: This is my favorite picture from these Olympics.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.\n\nOne day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures.\n\nI kept walking down. Still, nothing much. The competition went on, and I didn\u2019t have a picture yet. I heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. When I had nearly reached the bottom, I saw a gap in the course. I peeked into it. I tried looking for several different groups of fans, but I didn\u2019t see much in the way of reactions.\n\nThen, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.\n\nThree fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.\n\nImage Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic stood stunned after winning the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDid I Really Just Do That?\n\nBill Pennington: The outcome of the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. Or so it seemed. The top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time had already been recorded.\n\nThen Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. When she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. There was a No. 1 next to her name.\n\nOther racers and the audience were as stunned as Ledecka. But not three Czech fans in the grandstand. They began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.\n\nLedecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.\n\nBut there was no error, and bit by bit, the three Czech fans had a contagious effect on those around them. The cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. It almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth \u2014 and celebrated the capricious spirit of the Olympics.\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.\n\nNew York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here\u2019s a look at some of their favorites photos.\n\nImage Jamie Anderson of the United States won silver in snowboard big air on Thursday morning. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It\u2019s called big air for a reason.\n\nJamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.\n\nImage Shaun White competing at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail \u2014 sometimes over 20 feet above the rim \u2014 to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.\n\nAmerican Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nImage Cassie Sharpe of Canada won the gold in ski halfpipe. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don\u2019t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.\n\nCanada\u2019s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.\n\nImage Yuzuru Hanyu during his free skate. In this program, he scored second behind Nathan Chen of the United States. He scored a 317.85 in total, and was able to defend his Olympic title. Credit Margaret Cheatham Williams/The New York Times\n\nFor a figure skater to earn a spot on the podium, they need to rise above the ice. Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.\n\nJapanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women\u2019s skating competition at the Pyeongchang Games.

Vonn finished 6th. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nNo one can compete with the airborne speed of downhill skiers at the Olympics. To reach the bottom of the hill first, they must navigate jumps quickly and smoothly. That means being airborne at some 80 miles per hour and landing safely, only to make a turn and do it again.\n\nMarc Stein's Newsletter Marc Stein has covered Jordan. He's covered Kobe.

Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet.\n\nPhoto\n\nK-Pop Takes a Turn\n\nTime for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song \u201cThe Baddest Female\u201d and \u201cI Am the Best,\u201d with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas!\n\nPhoto\n\nVisual Spectacle and Some Math\n\nNext a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: \u201cWhen the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.\u201d And \u201cThe Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.\u201d Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.\n\nPhoto\n\nCross-Country Medalists Share the Stage\n\nTraditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is \u201cescrime.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea Carry Their Own Flags\n\nRather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea.\n\nOn the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Parade of Flags, Minus One\n\nNext up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games.\n\nThe Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 14 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon\u2019s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA Blending of Traditional and Rock Music\n\nJang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment. The anthem was accompanied not by an orchestra but by a single marimba, a xylophone-like instrument. And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi\u2019s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock \u2014 the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Colorful Introduction and a Handshake\n\nIn a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games.\n\nIt was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

That group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe Bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late Saturday. The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nTwo investigations revealed that Russia\u2019s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years.

She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country\u2019s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations.

In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.\u2019s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012)\n\n\u201cIf the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,\u201d Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating.\n\nRichard Pound, the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia.

Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back.

For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together. She recalled sharing a moment with Bjorgen when they were each presented a stuffed white Soohorang tiger, the Olympic mascot, during the podium ceremony. They looked at each other with a knowing laugh.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, this is for Breck,\u2019 and she said, \u2018This is for Marius.\u2019 \u201d", "keywords": ["wanted", "family", "randall", "skis", "bronze", "away", "motherhood", "baby", "gold", "international", "federation", "team", "breck", "olympic", "ski", "olympics"], "polarity": 0.11003659039373326, "subjectivity": 0.35858757644471934},

Shiffrin may yet be a transcendent talent who sets a host of Olympic medal records, but is anyone else in the American ski racing community going to rise up and give her a hand?\n\nIn the last two weeks here, besides Vonn and Shiffrin, there were women on the United States team who showed promise. In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here. That\u2019s a long way from the eight medals the Olympic men\u2019s team won at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all cylinders firing, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t turn it around in a two- to four-year cycle,\u201d said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, the umbrella group overseeing the ski team. \u201cWe have a lot of young talent.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined. Bennett and Cochran-Siegle are each 25 years old.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBuried for now deep on the United States ski team\u2019s roster are other American men with impressive junior racing pedigrees who were simply too untested on the World Cup level to qualify for the trip to Pyeongchang.

Radamus, 19, has been near the top of the overall standings on what amounts to ski racing\u2019s minor league circuit for most of this winter.

Image A spectator from Norway at the Pyeongchang Olympics biathlon competition revealed which country had the biggest medal haul. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 Surpassing its own lofty expectations, Norway has delivered the greatest performance in the history of the Winter Games, winning a total of 39 medals, 14 of them gold. A nation of only five million people has crushed all comers, including sports behemoths like Germany and the United States, in the events Norwegians care about the most.\n\nElsewhere, these historic results would yield the kind of street parties where strangers high-five one another until their hands hurt. In Norway, celebrations have been far more subdued. The most raucous it has gotten so far is a lot of joyful shouting at the television.\n\n\u201cWe always want to win,\u201d said Fredrik Aukland, a TV sports commentator in Norway. \u201cBut modesty is a big part of the culture here. And Norwegians don\u2019t go out much.\u201d\n\nUnless it\u2019s Constitution Day, ostentatious displays of all kinds are frowned upon in Norway, especially when it comes to wealth, a notable feature in one of the world\u2019s richest countries. Nobody expects a parade for returning athletes, even though they are bringing home 14 medals in cross-country, six in biathlon, five in ski jumping, seven in Alpine skiing and four in speedskating.\n\nThe haul is sure to revive pangs of concern that have shadowed Norway\u2019s streak of victories in recent years \u2014 that the country may dominate some winter sports so thoroughly that it is ruining them.\n\nImage Marit Bjoergen crossed the finish line ahead of Sweden\u2019s Stina Nilsson to give Norway a gold medal in the women\u2019s 4x5-kilometer cross-country relay at the Pyeongchang Games. Credit Matthias Schrader/Associated Press\n\nThat anxiety is strongest in cross-country skiing, which is adored with a fervor that stretches back centuries. Norwegians fear lopsided results can demolish enthusiasm for a sport in countries that are getting demolished.\n\nJustyna Kowalczyk, an Olympic athlete from Poland who competed in Pyeongchang, calls it a paradox. Norway may love cross-country to death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that they have a big budget, big sponsors and that everyone in Norway loves skiing,\u201d Kowalczyk, who has won five Olympic medals, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut that makes it really difficult for countries like Poland to compete.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t unusual for one country to own a sport, at least for a while. The Netherlands does it in speedskating, the United States in basketball. The difference is that Norwegians say they desperately want cross-country skiing to gain a large, sustained following around the world, and that means nurturing an audience on television.\n\nCross-country races are televised every weekend, from November to mid-April, to large swaths of Europe. Ratings in different nations rise when homegrown contenders are in the mix and shrink when they are not.\n\nSince 2011, when Norway\u2019s ascendant era began, viewership figures have dwindled by about 40 percent, said Jurg Capol, the marketing director of the International Ski Federation.\n\nImage The start of the 50 kilometer mass start classic cross-country race on Saturday. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\n\u201cIf the athlete from your country keeps finishing in 23rd place, you\u2019re less likely to see the race in your country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about results.\u201d\n\nTo thrive, cross-country needs national heroes in places like Germany, which has a population of more than 82 million. And while the United States, Sweden and other countries have lately won some major titles, the Norwegians took gold at all five of the women\u2019s events at the world championships in Finland last year, and won a total of 18 medals, more than any other country. Norway won 15 in cross-country. The next-closest country won four.\n\nAll of this presents a conundrum for Norwegians. They want their athletes to destroy everyone in their favorite sport, but the sport could be destroyed unless other countries win.\n\nA similar tension is built into Norway\u2019s fortune, which comes from vast oil reserves and has turned the nation\u2019s sovereign wealth fund into the largest in the world. Norwegians are green to the core, and when it comes to their own energy needs, they are huge fans of the clean, renewable variety. They also pocket billions from fossil fuels.\n\nA surfeit of gold and oil \u2014 bigger problems have plagued nations. But Norway is not going to stop drilling, and it certainly won\u2019t handicap its cross-country athletes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing, but some people in Norway yell at us when we win too much,\u201d said Knut Nystad, who heads the team\u2019s 30-person wax tech operation. \u201cOther countries dominate other sports. Why is the argument against success made only in the sport where we\u2019re succeeding?\u201d\n\nImage Didrik Toenseth of Norway led the pack in first leg of the men\u2019s 4x10-kilometer cross-country relay, yet another event that resulted in gold for the Norwegians. Credit Adam Pretty/Getty Images\n\nInstead of holding back its athletes, Norway is trying to lift others everywhere else. It has conceived the Alpine athletics version of the Marshall Plan. For seven years, it has invited competitors from all over the world to visit for a weeklong training camp. A separate camp is offered to World Cup coaches. Attendees pay to get there, and Norway covers all other expenses.\n\n\u201cWe show them what works for us,\u201d said Erik Roste, president of the Norwegian Ski Federation. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the blueprint, but we feel a responsibility to the international community, and we want to be open. We want to share our knowledge.\u201d\n\nOf course, one week in Norway will not suffice. The country\u2019s pre-eminence stems from a long list of factors, only a few of which could be reproduced anywhere else. The most elusive is culturally embedded. In a sparsely populated nation covered with snow, a pair of skis has been indispensable, and countless children start to learn as toddlers.\n\nThis helps explain why the breadth and depth of passion for the sport has few parallels. Love for cross-country became an essential national trait, one that any ingratiating foreigner has to embrace. Even royalty. When Norway voted to break its union with Sweden in 1905, it recruited the son of Denmark\u2019s king to serve as monarch. The new king was given an invaluable piece of advice by a famous Norwegian adventurer.\n\n\u201cFridtjof Nansen told King Haakon that he didn\u2019t need to learn the language to win the hearts of Norwegians,\u201d Roste said. \u201cHe needed to learn to ski. And he did.\u201d\n\nThen there is Norway\u2019s abiding infatuation with its lush natural surroundings. People have such a deep bond with the landscape that there is a ubiquitous word for communing with it: friluftsliv, a.k.a. \u201copen-air living.\u201d The concept is so popular that NRK, the nation\u2019s largest TV network, found a way for Norwegians to enjoy it indoors.\n\nImage Kikkan Randall, left, and Jessica Diggins gave the United States its first gold medal in cross-country skiing, in the team sprint. Norway\u2019s Marit Bjoergen, second from right, and Maiken Caspersen Falla won the bronze. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn 2011, the network placed a camera on the front of a boat called the MS Nordnorge and ran live footage for 134 hours of nothing but nature, quietly passing by. Half of the country tuned in.\n\nThe love for nature and skiing has given rise to some 1,000 ski clubs. Informal and low budget, many of them are driven by volunteers and overseen by parents. But they give the sport a vast and fertile grass-roots base.\n\nAt this Olympics, one of Norway\u2019s breakout stars has been the 21-year-old Johannes Klaebo, who emerged from Byasen Idrettslag, a club in the city of Trondheim, and won three cross-country gold medals. Nobody had heard of him a year and a half ago.\n\n\u201cHe could have been a great soccer player, he could have been great at any sport he chose,\u201d said Aukland, the sports commentator for NRK. \u201cHe chose cross-country skiing because it\u2019s the most popular.\u201d\n\nWhich is why, at the highest levels, the sport has sponsors like banks, oil companies and insurers. These deep-pocketed benefactors help fund research and development as well as expensive equipment. This includes a two-story, 1,100-square-foot waxing truck with a state-of-the art ventilation system. It cost $1 million.\n\nThe combination of tradition, training and support is nearly impossible for other countries to match, which is why, here in Pyeongchang, when other countries won, Norwegian athletes occasionally sounded relieved to give up at least some of the spotlight. Marit Bjorgen became the winningest athlete in Winter Olympics history when she nabbed her 14th medal at the team sprint race. She took bronze. Gold went to the United States, and silver to Sweden.\n\nIn an interview after the race, Bjorgen seemed sincerely pleased with the outcome.\n\n\u201cOf course we were fighting for gold,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s great to see the U.S. on the podium. It\u2019s important for the sport.\u201d\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 1 of the New York edition with the headline: After 38 Medals, Norway Feels Stress of Success\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

Mr. Lee said that the pair jumped into the car and drove from Daegwalryong village in Pyeongchang to the athletes\u2019 village, in Gangneung.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the athlete or the manager drove the car.

The new event featured four head-to-head matchups down a short slalom course with a small jump. Wendy Holdener of the winning team picked up her third medal of the Games and Ramon Zenhausern his second.\n\nNorway won the bronze. A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Missed\n\nKjeld Nuis of the Netherlands, the 1,500-meter winner, edged Havard Lorentzen of Norway, the 500-meter winner, in the men\u2019s 1,000-meter speedskating race. It was the seventh gold medal for the Netherlands out of 12 events so far.\n\nThe old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men\u2019s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first. Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth.\n\nIn a thrilling end to a battle between the sport\u2019s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women\u2019s ice hockey . Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson\u2019s goal in the sixth round of the shootout sealed the victory for the Americans, giving the team its first gold in the event since 1998.\n\nAlina Zagitova of Russia won the Olympic gold medal in women\u2019s figure skating, edging out her countrywoman, Evgenia Medvedeva. The two skaters tied in the free skate, but Zagitova\u2019s small edge in the short program made the difference.\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next\n\nThe closing ceremony\n\nVictor Mather is a general assignment sports reporter and editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["york", "bobsled", "started", "united", "sport", "skating", "luge", "winter", "states", "olympic", "credit", "athletes"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

It debuted on the World Cup circuit during the 2011-12 season. Other events in long-track speedskating are pure time trials, wherein athletes, in pairs, race the clock and know where they\u2019ve finished only after everyone has finished skating.\n\nMass start puts up to 28 skaters on the ice at the same time to race 16 laps around the 400-meter oval. Competitors are not restricted to their lanes, as in other long-track events. Skaters therefore have to think about much more than pure speed. They make tactical decisions about whether to stick with the pack or make a breakaway move. They draft one another and try to read their intentions.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome say it resembles short-track speedskating on a long-track oval. Some say it feels more like a running or cycling race.

These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.\n\nOf the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman \u201cpracticing\u201d the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d which premiered during the Games.\n\nWhile the Roomba curler did indeed \u201churry hard,\u201d here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.\n\nImage Chloe Kim of the United States during her halfpipe gold medal run.

White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.\n\nBut the discussion this time was not all about White\u2019s athletic achievements.

Historically speaking, it is a nation of broom-wielding, rock-shoving wizards. Their Olympic trials are the most competitive curling competition on the planet. Plus, the sport is played on ice, and Canada is pretty good at stuff that involves ice.\n\nEntering these Games, Canadians had never gone without a medal in any curling event since the sport made its debut at the 1998 Winter Olympics. They were 10 for 10, a stretch of dominance that included the last three gold medals in the men\u2019s competition.\n\nSo to do what they did here (or didn\u2019t do here) would be comparable to the United States men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball teams failing to win a medal at the Summer Olympics. But just as basketball has become a global sport, with improved competition from countries like Spain and Serbia, curling has benefited from increased popularity around the world.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The world championships were being held in Michigan. An American boycott would have been a huge embarrassment. The players risked ruining their shot at these Olympics, and derailing their careers. But their effort resonated outside the sport. Billie Jean King lent her support, and so did a group of United States senators. No matter the consequences, the hockey players wouldn\u2019t \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 back down.\n\nU.S.A. Hockey was forced to give up, and it was a pivotal moment in the history of women\u2019s sports.\n\n\u201cWe bonded so much over it, and it brought us together,\u201d Duggan said on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d be here right now if we hadn\u2019t stuck together.\u201d\n\nThree days before the world championships last year, the players and the federation signed a new deal that provided athletes a salary of about $70,000 a year.

Hockey, players were paid $6,000 in an Olympic year \u2014 and nothing in between Olympic years. Now the women don\u2019t have to worry about their finances when making the decision of sticking with the game or not.\n\nJocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, who scored the winning goal in the shootout, said she could now consider staying with the game because she still loved it and was still good at it.\n\n\u201cTo have that choice, I think means the world to us,\u201d she said.\n\nTo have a gold medal around their necks isn\u2019t so bad either.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Lamoureux-Davidson scored in the sixth round of a tiebreaking shootout, her shot resonated throughout the sport.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With a couple of deft fakes and a whir of her stick, Lamoureux-Davidson sent the puck skittering past Canada\u2019s goalie, giving the United States the 3-2 victory and their first Olympic gold medal since 1998.\n\n\u201cI feel like the gold medal adds more credibility to what we\u2019re trying to do with women\u2019s sports in our country,\u201d forward Hilary Knight said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying our voice or our skills are any less if we didn\u2019t win.

She spent all night Thursday and all Friday thinking about the bigger picture of this Olympic victory.\n\nShe thought about it so much, and celebrated it so much as she sipped Champagne and chatted with friends and family members, that she never even fell asleep Thursday night.\n\nFriday she kept her gold medal in the pocket of her Team U.S.A. jacket.

But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number, a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches \u2014 and others \u2014 from tuning in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions.

Credit Antonio Bat/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nVictor Mather: Four years ago, Norway had by all accounts a screamingly successful Winter Olympics, but failed to win the events it treasures the most: the cross country relays. Indeed, Norway failed even to win a medal, placing fourth in the men\u2019s race and fifth in the women\u2019s.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.\n\nBut Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.\n\nThen she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)\n\nAnd the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.\n\nFor good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again.\n\nImage Adam Rippon in the men's free skate.

Imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. But then along came the walking book of quotations known as Adam Rippon, whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.\n\nRippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks.

Normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. This vantage point gave an entirely different view.\n\nOne cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.\n\nAs they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.\n\nImage Jingyu Lee and Yoonjung Park of the unified Korean hockey team took a lap around the ice after their final game of the Olympics.

Yet after the team\u2019s final game, against Sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, \u201cWe are one!\u201d\n\nThen the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 Seoul Games, \u201cHand in Hand,\u201d blared across the arena.

During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Perfect Comeback\n\nJere Longman: Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany, who were among the favorites in the pairs figure skating competition, fell to fourth after the short program when Massot made a jumping mistake. He seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.\n\nBut they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.\n\nUntil November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games.

Nothing from \u201cCarmen\u201d or \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Not one of those go-to figure skating songs that I\u2019d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first Winter Games in 2002.\n\nThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.\n\nHer music had the rafters shaking. It was AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d and Toth was dressed as a biker. She wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of AC/DC\u2019s lead guitarist, Angus Young, on the back. She also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. It was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.\n\nAs the music suggested, Toth rocked it. Half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d a staple of N.F.L. games. The other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. I swear that I could see the judges growing pale.\n\nToth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.\n\nWhen Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201d\n\nImage Joe Ward, left, with Doug Mills, whom he calls one of his \"heroes.\" Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Going to Be a Good Morning\u2019\n\nJoe Ward: Anytime you can start your workday on a chairlift with the Pulitzer Prize-winning White House photographer Doug Mills, you know it\u2019s going to be a good morning. Wind chills of minus-20 and gusts of 60 m.p.h. only make the experience of working alongside one of your journalistic heroes all the more memorable.\n\nDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor. Some days, more than others, you realize you\u2019re lucky to be doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nImage Artur Nogal of Poland falling painfully early in the speedskating sprint. Credit John Sibley/Reuters\n\nAn Athlete Falls, and Applause Rises\n\nDavid Segal: If Poland\u2019s Artur Nogal ever has grandchildren and wants to tell them about his Olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.\n\nIf records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.\n\nImage Family and fans of Anna Gasser of Austria celebrate her win in the women's Big Air snowboarding final. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nA Visual Cue From the Roar of the Crowd\n\nBedel Saget: As a visual journalist, I find it interesting that my favorite moment of the Pyeongchang Games was a strictly audible one. For the women\u2019s big air final, I was shooting from a position where I could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (Ask the silver medalist, Jamie Anderson, who couldn\u2019t hold onto first place after failing to land her \u201ccab double cork 1080\u201d in the final round.)\n\nI followed as best as I could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. By the third and final round, I had a strong feeling that the Austrian Anna Gasser \u2014 the reigning world champion and favorite whom I\u2019d followed for an entire year for one of our Olympic preview interactive graphics \u2014 would land somewhere on the podium.\n\nThe stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.\n\nImage Vice President Mike Pence of the United States and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea shared a laugh at the women's 500 meters short-track speedskating race. Credit Julie Jacobson/Associated Press\n\nA Night of Geopolitics, and Gold\n\nRandal C. Archibold: In one night, I saw South Korea win its first gold medal, Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage push past me, and the North Korean cheerleading squad execute \u201cthe wave\u201d with robotic precision.\n\nWho knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?\n\nIt was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.\n\nImage Who let this guy come to the top of the jump? Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAn Olympic Veteran Reaches New Heights\n\nDoug Mills: Without a doubt, my pinch-me moment came when I was allowed to spend time up in the ski jumpers\u2019 start house. This is a place I had never visited while photographing several other Games, and I had not seen many photos made from inside.\n\nI would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.\n\nImage \"As long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the Norwegian men at the train station. Credit Inyoung Kang\n\nNorwegian Fans Help Make the World Smaller\n\nInyoung Kang: I was waiting for the 8:24 train back to Seoul when I heard the two men coming \u2014 laughing, chattering, clanking. They were covered in Norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their Viking plushies.\n\nI gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.\n\nI snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\n\n\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201d\n\nThe first Olympics I remember watching were the Nagano Games in 1998. As a child, I was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. Now, 20 years later, I was in the country of my parents\u2019 birth to cover my first Olympics. I have always felt a bit like an outsider \u2014 a minority at home or a foreigner with an American accent here. But that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to Korea, the world felt a little smaller. I thanked the Norwegians, and we parted ways.\n\n\n\nImage At the finish of the team sprint, Jessie Diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for Team U.S.A., clinching its first gold in cross country. Credit Dmitri Lovetsky/Associated Press\n\nBecause Minnesota\n\nTalya Minsberg: \u201cBecause Minnesota.\u201d That\u2019s a reason I was assigned to follow the United States women\u2019s cross country team throughout the Winter Games. Both Jessie Diggins and I grew up in Minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the Twin Cities.\n\nDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.\n\nOn Feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. On Feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. Two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just 3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. And when the stands were the fullest, on Feb. 17, the American team of Sophie Caldwell, Sadie Bjornsen, Kikkan Randall and Diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.\n\nWhen asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so many narrow misses, Diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201d\n\nThe race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in Olympic highlight reels for years. Diggins and Randall didn\u2019t just win a medal. They took the gold.\n\n\n\nImage The Pyeongchang crowds approached the Olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nSome of the Best Pictures Are Not of Athletes\n\nHilary Swift: One of my favorite days at the Olympics was the qualifying runs for women\u2019s big air snowboarding. It was probably the warmest day I can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.\n\nMy colleague Doug Mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so I was free to roam the crowd and look for features. To me, this photo speaks to what the Olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. You may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you\u2019re supporting your country\u2019s athletes and others from all over the world.\n\nImage The media buses at the Olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the Games. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nPardon the Delay While My Country Races\n\nAndrew Keh: A bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last Sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.\n\nRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.\n\nBus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\n\nTwo days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the South Korean women\u2019s curling win over the United States team. Some passengers clapped as the women, unexpected stars of the Games, celebrated on screen. The driver laughed out loud.\n\n\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.\n\nImage Michelle Gisin of Switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the Alpine combined a few days later. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nExceptional on the Slopes, Normal on the Bus\n\nTara Parker-Pope: For me, the best part of the Olympics happened between competitions, when I would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. I struck up a conversation with the Swiss skier Michelle Gisin on a bus \u2014 about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister Dominique won a gold medal in Sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.\n\nGisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing exceptional things.\n\nImage Two old friends, Matthew Futterman, left, and Jason Albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day. Credit Gabby Naranja\n\nIs That You, Jason?\n\nMatthew Futterman: The Olympic Games are supposed to be about bringing people together.\n\nAs a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?\n\nWe spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating problems large and small \u2014 Iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.\n\nOn graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nThe day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.\n\nIn that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.\n\nImage From left to right, Mina Kim, Robert Fissel and the brothers Keun Hwan and Dong-hyung Lee taking in a bobsled race. \"It's so fast,\" Dong-hyung Lee said. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nThe Best Bobsled Picture Has No Bobsled\n\nChang W. Lee: This is my favorite picture from these Olympics.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.\n\nOne day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures.\n\nI kept walking down. Still, nothing much. The competition went on, and I didn\u2019t have a picture yet. I heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. When I had nearly reached the bottom, I saw a gap in the course. I peeked into it. I tried looking for several different groups of fans, but I didn\u2019t see much in the way of reactions.\n\nThen, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.\n\nThree fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.\n\nImage Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic stood stunned after winning the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDid I Really Just Do That?\n\nBill Pennington: The outcome of the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. Or so it seemed. The top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time had already been recorded.\n\nThen Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. When she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. There was a No. 1 next to her name.\n\nOther racers and the audience were as stunned as Ledecka. But not three Czech fans in the grandstand. They began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.\n\nLedecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.\n\nBut there was no error, and bit by bit, the three Czech fans had a contagious effect on those around them. The cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. It almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth \u2014 and celebrated the capricious spirit of the Olympics.\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.\n\nNew York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here\u2019s a look at some of their favorites photos.\n\nImage Jamie Anderson of the United States won silver in snowboard big air on Thursday morning. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It\u2019s called big air for a reason.\n\nJamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.\n\nImage Shaun White competing at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail \u2014 sometimes over 20 feet above the rim \u2014 to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.\n\nAmerican Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nImage Cassie Sharpe of Canada won the gold in ski halfpipe. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don\u2019t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.\n\nCanada\u2019s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.\n\nImage Yuzuru Hanyu during his free skate.

Credit Margaret Cheatham Williams/The New York Times\n\nFor a figure skater to earn a spot on the podium, they need to rise above the ice. Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.\n\nJapanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women\u2019s skating competition at the Pyeongchang Games.

To reach the bottom of the hill first, they must navigate jumps quickly and smoothly. That means being airborne at some 80 miles per hour and landing safely, only to make a turn and do it again.\n\nMarc Stein's Newsletter Marc Stein has covered Jordan. He's covered Kobe.

Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet.\n\nPhoto\n\nK-Pop Takes a Turn\n\nTime for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song \u201cThe Baddest Female\u201d and \u201cI Am the Best,\u201d with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas!\n\nPhoto\n\nVisual Spectacle and Some Math\n\nNext a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: \u201cWhen the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.\u201d And \u201cThe Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.\u201d Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.\n\nPhoto\n\nCross-Country Medalists Share the Stage\n\nTraditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is \u201cescrime.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea Carry Their Own Flags\n\nRather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea.\n\nOn the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Parade of Flags, Minus One\n\nNext up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games.\n\nThe Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 14 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon\u2019s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA Blending of Traditional and Rock Music\n\nJang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment. The anthem was accompanied not by an orchestra but by a single marimba, a xylophone-like instrument. And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi\u2019s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock \u2014 the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Colorful Introduction and a Handshake\n\nIn a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games.\n\nIt was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

That group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe Bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late Saturday. The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nTwo investigations revealed that Russia\u2019s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years. Many of Russia\u2019s top athletes were linked to the scandal and barred from the Games.\n\nAlina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, was the only Russian to have won a gold medal in Pyeongchang by the time the committee voted. The men\u2019s hockey team won a second gold on Sunday, defeating Germany.\n\nThe Russians will now leave the Olympics the way they entered: in neutral uniforms that provided a constant reminder of the damage done to Russia\u2019s sporting reputation by the scheme, a state-controlled effort to replace drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones, according to the investigations.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two Games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. Before the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where Russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. It made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these Winter Olympics.

She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country\u2019s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. Russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision everyone will be happy with,\u201d Hoevertsz said after Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cWe will be criticized.\u201d\n\nThe decision to potentially reinstate Russia met skepticism on Sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.\u2019s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012)\n\n\u201cIf the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,\u201d Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating.\n\nRichard Pound, the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia.

They have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols.\n\nThe two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said.

It seems to have worked. Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together.

In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined.

As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth.\n\nIn a thrilling end to a battle between the sport\u2019s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women\u2019s ice hockey . Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson\u2019s goal in the sixth round of the shootout sealed the victory for the Americans, giving the team its first gold in the event since 1998.\n\nAlina Zagitova of Russia won the Olympic gold medal in women\u2019s figure skating, edging out her countrywoman, Evgenia Medvedeva. The two skaters tied in the free skate, but Zagitova\u2019s small edge in the short program made the difference.\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next\n\nThe closing ceremony\n\nVictor Mather is a general assignment sports reporter and editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["york", "bobsled", "started", "united", "sport", "skating", "luge", "winter", "states", "olympic", "credit", "athletes"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

It debuted on the World Cup circuit during the 2011-12 season. Other events in long-track speedskating are pure time trials, wherein athletes, in pairs, race the clock and know where they\u2019ve finished only after everyone has finished skating.\n\nMass start puts up to 28 skaters on the ice at the same time to race 16 laps around the 400-meter oval. Competitors are not restricted to their lanes, as in other long-track events. Skaters therefore have to think about much more than pure speed. They make tactical decisions about whether to stick with the pack or make a breakaway move. They draft one another and try to read their intentions.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome say it resembles short-track speedskating on a long-track oval. Some say it feels more like a running or cycling race.

These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.\n\nOf the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman \u201cpracticing\u201d the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d which premiered during the Games.\n\nWhile the Roomba curler did indeed \u201churry hard,\u201d here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.\n\nImage Chloe Kim of the United States during her halfpipe gold medal run.

White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.\n\nBut the discussion this time was not all about White\u2019s athletic achievements. On the heels of his gold medal performance, he was asked about past sexual harassment allegations.

The federation began hunting for replacement players for worlds. The national team players began calling those potential replacements, asking them to take their side for the good of the game\u2019s future \u2014 for all the women and little girls who hoped to be treated equally in the future.\n\nA lot was at stake. The world championships were being held in Michigan. An American boycott would have been a huge embarrassment. The players risked ruining their shot at these Olympics, and derailing their careers. But their effort resonated outside the sport. Billie Jean King lent her support, and so did a group of United States senators. No matter the consequences, the hockey players wouldn\u2019t \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 back down.\n\nU.S.A. Hockey was forced to give up, and it was a pivotal moment in the history of women\u2019s sports.\n\n\u201cWe bonded so much over it, and it brought us together,\u201d Duggan said on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d be here right now if we hadn\u2019t stuck together.\u201d\n\nThree days before the world championships last year, the players and the federation signed a new deal that provided athletes a salary of about $70,000 a year. That off-ice victory has given the players so many options now.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to quit the sport because they can\u2019t support themselves. Before their new contract with U.S.A. Hockey, players were paid $6,000 in an Olympic year \u2014 and nothing in between Olympic years. Now the women don\u2019t have to worry about their finances when making the decision of sticking with the game or not.\n\nJocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, who scored the winning goal in the shootout, said she could now consider staying with the game because she still loved it and was still good at it.\n\n\u201cTo have that choice, I think means the world to us,\u201d she said.\n\nTo have a gold medal around their necks isn\u2019t so bad either.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Lamoureux-Davidson scored in the sixth round of a tiebreaking shootout, her shot resonated throughout the sport.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With a couple of deft fakes and a whir of her stick, Lamoureux-Davidson sent the puck skittering past Canada\u2019s goalie, giving the United States the 3-2 victory and their first Olympic gold medal since 1998.\n\n\u201cI feel like the gold medal adds more credibility to what we\u2019re trying to do with women\u2019s sports in our country,\u201d forward Hilary Knight said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying our voice or our skills are any less if we didn\u2019t win. I just think more people start paying attention, and we\u2019re 100 percent trying to inspire the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe team spent Friday being interviewed by reporters from morning until evening, and they could barely stop to breathe.\n\nDuggan told me that this whole year has been \u201cfor women\u2019s hockey in America,\u201d and so much more.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment for women in other sports and women in business and in every single walk of life,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to show our power and what women can do, so we can work more toward equality.\u201d\n\nThinking about that responsibility can be overwhelming, Knight said. She spent all night Thursday and all Friday thinking about the bigger picture of this Olympic victory.\n\nShe thought about it so much, and celebrated it so much as she sipped Champagne and chatted with friends and family members, that she never even fell asleep Thursday night.\n\nFriday she kept her gold medal in the pocket of her Team U.S.A. jacket. She said she didn\u2019t wear the medal because its ribbon pulls on her neck too much.

While it was Giacometti who conceived the whimsical bronze pieces dripping with tiny flora and fauna, it was Anthonioz who did most of the fabrication; his spidery chairs, benches and oversize resin chandeliers form a conceptual bridge between the building\u2019s 17th-century architecture and Picasso\u2019s slashing Modernism. \u201cI am proud of what we did, of course,\u201d Anthonioz says, recalling the generosity of the older artist, whom he had first met when he was 13 through his well-connected father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be defined by that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Anthonioz \u2014 who mostly sculpts in wood and plaster that is often cast in bronze \u2014 is known for his large-scale, abstract public statuary and custom-made lighting and functional objects for architects including Joseph Dirand, the fashion designer Tomas Maier and the interiors brand Ralph Pucci, for which he makes a line of bronze torchieres. Since 1979, he has kept his main studio in Passage Saint Bernard, a two-block-long cobblestone street not far from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, Afi Nayo, a Togolese mixed-media artist.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he moved in, the alley had been home to generations of the city\u2019s furniture-makers, restorers and ebonizers. For the first 15 years, he occupied the second floor of No. 17, a magnificent 18th-century wooden building that was torn down to make way for an apartment complex in the mid-1990s, part of a short-lived attempt by Paris officials to erect new housing. But Anthonioz, enamored of the neighborhood\u2019s gritty charm \u2014 he compares it to Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, back before the boutiques descended in the early aughts \u2014 remained, moving a few doors down to the 1,600-square-foot ground floor of another 18th-century building, one accessible through an aged oak door. \u201cIf there is no romance in the environment,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to make good things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike the studios of many contemporary artists, which are often minimalist affairs, defiantly ahistorical, his is redolent of the past. The front is an art-book-filled office-cum-salon, with walls hung with antique mirrors and vintage photos, including one of Charles Baudelaire, his lodestar; the back is a workshop crowded with stone arms and torsos, piled alongside pieces of old chandeliers used to construct limited-edition light fixtures for spaces like Loulou, the Dirand-designed restaurant in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Frosted with fine plaster dust, the space itself seems sepia-toned, like a Eug\u00e8ne Atget photograph.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Anthonioz and Giacometti shared the belief that there should be no dividing line between decoration and fine art, their aesthetics diverged radically. Giacometti was obsessed with figuration and the natural world \u2014 he spent hours studying birds in the city\u2019s Jardin des Plantes, where Henri Rousseau had once found inspiration \u2014 but Anthonioz has always been driven by abstraction. Giacometti was a master of affixing tiny animals and curling leaves to the bronze framework of his designs, lending them a fey quality; Anthonioz eschews ornament, preferring sleek minimalist shapes. \u201cPeople always speak of me in the same breath as Diego, but I think of Carlo Scarpa, David Smith or even the Bauhaus,\u201d he says.\n\nIndeed, his sculptures have become increasingly monumental in recent years \u2014 the eight-foot-tall \u201cLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e,\u201d a cast-bronze totem, was installed in Pratt Institute\u2019s Brooklyn sculpture garden in 2016 \u2014 so he now works part-time in a lofty second studio in Ivry-sur-Seine, a southeastern suburb. He is also restoring an 18th-century farmhouse in the south, near Aix-en-Provence, where he plans to make work in his later years, in a barn he\u2019s converting into a studio. There, he hopes his five grown children will bring their own kids to run in the fields. \u201cMy work has gotten more abstract, maybe even more modern, as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog on a leash \u2014 not in what I create, and not in how I live my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["tiny", "sculptor", "inside", "work", "wonders", "bronze", "parisian", "18thcentury", "charles", "sculptors", "anthonioz", "studio", "giacometti", "world", "works"], "polarity": 0.1389933820968304, "subjectivity": 0.38793414439966156},

For most of history, it did only what it had to: provide a home when you were away from yours. Then, in the last century, a hotel became a place meant not just for shelter, but a destination; a place that embraced its not-homeness by being better than your home could ever be.\n\nNow, a new project is defining the hotel anew. In September, 700,000 Heures will become the world\u2019s first nomadic hotel. The idea is that a hotel is not an actual structure, but a state of mind, a series of experiences, a respite from your life. Every six months, 700,000 Heures (the approximate length of an average human life in the developed world) will change locations, occupying different buildings in different places \u2014 sometimes an existing building will be reimagined or refit for the hotel\u2019s needs; other times, it might even be built from scratch. First up will be a four-room, 19th-century stone palazzo in Gagliano del Capo, a small town in Salento, Italy, known for its wild beaches and groves of knotted olive trees. Then, after this trial run, the palazzo will be returned to its owner, and 700,000 Heures will move to northwestern Cambodia, where guests will stay in a series of locations, among them an ancient Buddhist temple. Most of the structures the company inhabits will be small \u2014 likely no more than eight rooms in any one location \u2014 and first priority will be given to its several hundred members, who\u2019ll pay an annual 500 euro fee and will be able to opt into destinations as they please. (Those wanting to join can apply through one of 700,000 Heures\u2019 50 approved travel agents.) The company is the invention of a French hotelier named Thierry Teyssier, who over the years has operated small, exquisite hotels in Morocco, Portugal and Brazil. \u201cI want to be able to spend real time with my guests,\u201d he says. \u201c700,000 Heures is personal. It\u2019s the hotel I would like to find, if I were the traveler.\u201d\n\nAlthough 700,000 Heures will be the first impermanent hotel, it finds its origins in a dining and hospitality culture that has become ever more attracted to the ephemeral, the rootless and the rare. The past decade or so has seen a proliferation of pop-up restaurants and shops \u2014 Teyssier made his own contribution to this trend in the form of a pop-up hotel in Paraty, in southern Brazil, which operated for six months in 2014 before shutting down. At the same time, there\u2019s been an embrace of what might be called subscription-based hospitality: In London, there\u2019s Carousel, a restaurant with a constantly rotating series of guest chefs and a set menu each night for which tickets must be purchased in advance, or the membership-based Soho House, which now has 18 locations worldwide. Teyssier\u2019s company speaks to a certain kind of traveler\u2019s desire for both novelty and consistency \u2014 the location might be different, but the mood must always feel familiar.\n\nOne of the ways 700,000 Heures plans to achieve this is through Teyssier\u2019s presence; indeed, he\u2019ll act less as hotelier and more as impresario, remaining on-site through each of the hotel\u2019s incarnations, and organizing excursions and events for all of the guests. In Salento, this might mean a fishing-boat ride through hidden coves along the Adriatic, or a sunset picnic at Santa Maria di Leuca, a little-known Roman sanctuary. In Cambodia, destinations will include Tonle Sap Lake, a biosphere reserve with a floating village of wooden houses, or the French colonial city of Battambang, where travelers can train with acrobats at the renowned Phare Circus. The goal, Teyssier says, is for the guest to feel like an actor in a theatrical production: the natural outgrowth of an age in which vacations are presented like biopics on social media. And, as for an actor, 700,000 Heures also provides props: Along with the physical spaces, Teyssier has created a series of leather trunks \u2014 each filled with objects to create a different mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, from cocktail bar to art studio \u2014 that will appear at all of the hotels and will provide an aesthetic through line. The hotel will also present members with a mock passport, which will be stamped after each trip. \u201cSome people make sculpture,\u201d Teyssier says. \u201cI\u2019m in the business of creating memories.\u201d \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS\n\nImage \u201cCaa Caa\u201d (2017).

Rather, his aim is to poke fun at the imposed distinction between art and life by highlighting an object\u2019s strange journey from useful tool to used-up trash to a thing of value defined by uselessness (art). He even lives inside his longest-running piece \u2014 a multi-building compound in the center of town that, over the course of two decades, he\u2019s filled with work and fellow artists. \u201cInstead of making art about domesticity, I figured I\u2019d just make a house,\u201d he says.\n\nAt an installation opening this spring at the Hotel Indigo in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 a satellite space of the Santa Barbara Museum of Contemporary Art \u2014 visitors, too, can live among Coolquitt\u2019s work, about 25 pieces of which will fill the building\u2019s lobby and hallways. Coolquitt, who\u2019s shown everywhere from New York\u2019s Marianne Boesky Gallery to the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, believes a show should reflect its context. In this non-gallery setting, he saw an opportunity to be playful \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not really into confronting people with difficult ideas while they\u2019re on vacation,\u201d he says. That means synthetic pink wigs draped over lamps, a canvas affixed with bathrobe belts arrayed in clean vertical stripes and rectilinear wall hangings made of colorful bathmats (shown above) \u2014 the rare study in geometric abstraction where the polygons are plush. \u2014 SAM DEAN\n\nRunway Report: Logos a Go-Go\n\nImage Credit Illustrations by Jean-Michel Tixier\n\nFrom left: Comme des Garc\u0327ons Shirt Boys, $275, (212) 604-9200.

In 2016, after stints at the French Laundry and Northcote, his father\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant in Lancashire, England, the now-30-year-old British chef was diagnosed with Lyme disease and forced to take a break from his work. After noticing that heavy, processed foods exacerbated his symptoms, he started experimenting with a vegan diet. \u201cNow I treat myself through food and natural remedies alone; I don\u2019t take any pain medication,\u201d he says. With Plates, a plant-based restaurant he\u2019s opening with his sister Keeley in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood, he\u2019ll share his findings with an increasingly wellness-minded public, though this is hardly another juice-and-avocado-toast joint. Haworth\u2019s complex, cerebral dishes are grounded in classic techniques: In one, beetroot is salt-baked like beef with juniper and thyme, and then topped with fermented berries, avocado and fennel pollen from the nearby Hackney Marshes. Other standouts include a radicchio salad flavored with agave and wild blackberry vinegar (shown above) and a wild mushroom broth with immune-boosting shiitake, kombu and baked celeriac. \u201cIt can take weeks to replicate the richness of a sauce without butter, or to balance acidity without sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be intelligent with vegetables.\u201d \u2014 AIMEE FARRELL\n\nSign up for the Open Thread Newsletter A look from across the New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

{"title": "\n                    In Search of Lost Time in Europe\u2019s Sanatoriums                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/t-magazine/sanatorium-europe-history.html", "text": "Also connected to that culture was a parallel institution that flourished in Europe around the turn of the century: the thermal spa. Since the 1800s, doctors had been prescribing hydrotherapy, and health resorts were being established across the continent. As the historian David Clay Large has written, \u201cthe grand spas in their heyday amounted to their world\u2019s equivalent of today\u2019s golf and tennis resorts, conference centers, business retreats, political summits, fashion shows, theme parks and sexual hideaways \u2014 all rolled into one.\u201d\n\nPeople afflicted with everything from gout to arthritis came to \u201ctake the waters\u201d at spa towns across Europe, but unlike the sanatoriums with which they were concurrent, their visitors were not always ill. Instead they came to socialize, attend cultural events and negotiate political treaties. The towns themselves \u2014 Aix-les-Bains and Vichy in France; Bath and Buxton in England; Aachen and Baden-Baden in Germany \u2014 built above the rubble of thermal baths established by Roman conquerors centuries earlier, were plotted to maximize what was known as a \u201ctherapeutic landscape,\u201d a kind of aestheticized social engineering that promoted strolling and alfresco mingling. The architectural style of the bathhouses themselves was formal and atavistic, with marble walls, high arches, domed ceilings and mosaic floors. Well-maintained, infrastructurally sophisticated and aggressively promoted, these grand spa complexes were some of the earliest examples of modern tourist destinations.\n\nPhoto\n\nYEARS BEFORE THE concept of a politically and culturally unified Europe gained traction, withdrawing from life (if even for a week) was a recurring feature of Continental existence. Spa culture \u2014 defined by its intentional architecture, geographical remove and somnambulistic ambience \u2014 was experienced in direct opposition to the rapid-paced, sick-making atmosphere of industrialized Europe. Unlike in America, where tuberculosis sanatoriums functioned more like hospitals than lifestyle colonies, the bosky outreaches of central Europe served as a sort of mystical destination where people from kingdoms near and far could live temporarily apart from reality \u2014 intermingling, arguing, falling in love \u2014 even as the security and sovereignty of the world around them remained imperiled. It\u2019s unsurprising that a microcosm containing different types of people with little to do but reflect and cathect provided fiction writers with a generative setting, one which everyone from George Eliot to Henry James to Guy de Maupassant took advantage of.\n\nIndeed, with enough selective reading it can seem as though every 19th-century writer of note spent at least a little time at a spa town. Turgenev and Goethe took the waters at Karlovy Vary in western Bohemia; Dickens and Tennyson visited Yorkshire\u2019s Harrogate. The Black Forest-surrounded Baden-Baden was perhaps the most popular, especially among the Russians: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky both visited; Chekhov died 90 miles south of there in Badenweiler in 1904 after an injection of camphor, a sip of champagne and a few weeks of writing letters to his sister in which he described his diet (boiled mutton, strawberry tea and \u201cenormous quantities\u201d of butter) and complained about German women\u2019s poor taste in clothing. His body was brought home in a refrigerator car meant for oysters. Mark Twain visited the Bohemian spa town of Marianske Lazne (often referred to by its German name, Marienbad) in 1892 and sarcastically cataloged a spa regimen for a patient suffering from gout that involved rising at 5:30 a.m., drinking \u201cdreadful\u201d water, tramping in the hills, wallowing in the mud and eating as much as possible \u201cso long as he is careful and eats only such things as he doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMy daily routine in Marianske Lazne wasn\u2019t actually so different. It began with a walk through the small, central part of the village, whose springs have been touted as curative for centuries and which was visited by an almost-laughable list of luminaries that included state heads (Czar Nicholas II, Emperor Franz Josef I), intellectuals (Freud, Edison, Kafka, Nietzsche, Kipling) and composers (Mahler, Wagner, Chopin, Strauss). The town is made up of pale neo-Classical buildings edged with verdigrised turrets and elaborate spires. The public gardens are tidy and politely pretty. Czech couples stroll along camel-colored crushed-granite paths, carrying flattened porcelain spa cups whose handles also serve as straws and which they fill at public fountains. Large groups of Germans walk briskly in excessive hiking gear, stopping at outdoor cafes where they order steins of pilsner and read Der Spiegel. The Russians wear their bathrobes everywhere and keep to the gilded hotel lobbies, where they play chess with one another as mole-removal videos loop on overhead TVs. At the grand hotels, whose convoluted floor plans also house spas, sublimated weight loss strategies are nonexistent, as are the high-tech instruments and the suggestions of pan-Asian wellness (gongs, bamboo) that one sees everywhere in America. In the absence of vanity and hard science and globalism, a sort of generic and primal prewar Europeanness persists, as unsettling as it is soothing.\n\nAnd as Twain himself reported, the meals were indeed curious and the prescriptions harebrained. At the Danubius Health Spa Resort Centralni Lazne, treatments are administered in tiled, cobweb-laced rooms. My first was a \u201cmineral bath with natural CO2\u201d for which I was led into a stainless-steel bathtub by a caustic attendant and told to ignore a half-submerged rusty wire. The water, just above lukewarm and smelling of sulfur, fizzed lightly. I had the impression of floating in rapidly cooling club soda. The attendant came back in, unannounced, wrapped me in a blanket, and discouraged me from trying to remove an arm so I could read my book. Benefits are said to include \u201cimproved blood circulation, heart and kidney activity as well as reduced stress and anxiety.\u201d Later, I dawdled in a Kneipp foot bath, named for a Bavarian priest who advised walking without shoes through morning dew, and the following day spent a disturbing 30 minutes in a tiled alcove, while dry oxygen was delivered into my nostrils via a latex tube. Each evening, a heavy dinner was served (often including hot sauerkraut, beef tongue in cream sauce, pickled herring and, for dessert, whole peeled kiwis), followed by flutes of Bohemian sparkling wine, which one could sip while classical musicians performed.\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE SANATORIUMS OF Europe are now closed, and the spa towns where acute and imagined maladies alike were elevated to a glamorous lifestyle are today visited almost exclusively by the elderly. But medically informed repose \u2014 experienced far and away from the world, quietly and alongside others as sick (or not) as oneself \u2014 can still be had. In Vals, Switzerland, not 70 miles from Davos (once studded with about 40 sanatoriums), thermal waters run through the valley\u2019s granite walls. A beautiful if deliberately sterile-feeling spa hotel sits just above the small village and beckons visitors from all over the world, who come to bathe in silence and eat overpriced pear bread while gazing at verdant pastures. Those seeking wellness today do not want outdoor concerts or lectures or chitchat. They want to be by themselves, ideally in a photogenic location with poor cellphone service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe walls of the Peter Zumthor-designed spa, opened in 1996 under the name Therme Vals and now part of the 7132 Hotel, are made from 60,000 one-meter-long slabs of locally quarried quartzite; the concrete roof is covered with grass. Giant windows overlooking gray mountains somehow don\u2019t do much to brighten what is otherwise a dark and labyrinthine experience. \u201cMoving around this space means making discoveries,\u201d Zumthor has said. \u201cYou are walking as if in the woods. Everyone there is looking for a path of their own.\u201d\n\nI often wondered if I would ever find mine. I spent as much time soaking in various baths as I did wandering around through the mist between them. It was easy to appreciate the solemn beauty of Vals\u2019s imposing modern design, which was clearly plotted with great intention and intellect, while still feeling unpleasant panic each time you rounded a corner only to see a dim hallway coaxing you who knows where. Before the property owner stepped in and insisted otherwise, Zumthor was adamant that his spa have no clocks inside. He wanted bathers to feel not just weightless in the water but timeless too. The twin clocks that were installed are nearly hidden (I only found out about them weeks after I had come home) and the cavernous space succeeds in making the minutes melt into hours.\n\nIn daily life, it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t know the time down to the minute, and with the tap of a single skeuomorphic button I can find out where I am anywhere in the world, as well as whatever terrible things are happening halfway around it. In previous centuries, those suffering from ailments and ennui could travel through forests and up glaciers, by train and horse, to drink and dip in therapeutic waters. They endured unthinkable hassle to gain access to legendary liquids and dubious expertise. Today, we know better. Sunlight doesn\u2019t kill germs and physical maladies aren\u2019t cured by carbonated water. The best we can hope for is the kind of psychological balm that comes from temporarily removing oneself from the responsibilities of daily life, which lately seem to involve the helpless monitoring of catastrophes we can do nothing about. To travel from one empire in decline to countries whose golden eras were over 100 years in the past is to accept \u2014 and if possible, enjoy \u2014 the undeniable fact that disorientation can be its own kind of decadence.", "keywords": ["town", "walls", "search", "europe", "europes", "water", "lost", "sanatoriums", "visited", "waters", "towns", "spa", "world"], "polarity": 0.08353356276018148, "subjectivity": 0.5007576795706292},

While it was Giacometti who conceived the whimsical bronze pieces dripping with tiny flora and fauna, it was Anthonioz who did most of the fabrication; his spidery chairs, benches and oversize resin chandeliers form a conceptual bridge between the building\u2019s 17th-century architecture and Picasso\u2019s slashing Modernism. \u201cI am proud of what we did, of course,\u201d Anthonioz says, recalling the generosity of the older artist, whom he had first met when he was 13 through his well-connected father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be defined by that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Anthonioz \u2014 who mostly sculpts in wood and plaster that is often cast in bronze \u2014 is known for his large-scale, abstract public statuary and custom-made lighting and functional objects for architects including Joseph Dirand, the fashion designer Tomas Maier and the interiors brand Ralph Pucci, for which he makes a line of bronze torchieres. Since 1979, he has kept his main studio in Passage Saint Bernard, a two-block-long cobblestone street not far from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, Afi Nayo, a Togolese mixed-media artist.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he moved in, the alley had been home to generations of the city\u2019s furniture-makers, restorers and ebonizers. For the first 15 years, he occupied the second floor of No. 17, a magnificent 18th-century wooden building that was torn down to make way for an apartment complex in the mid-1990s, part of a short-lived attempt by Paris officials to erect new housing. But Anthonioz, enamored of the neighborhood\u2019s gritty charm \u2014 he compares it to Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, back before the boutiques descended in the early aughts \u2014 remained, moving a few doors down to the 1,600-square-foot ground floor of another 18th-century building, one accessible through an aged oak door. \u201cIf there is no romance in the environment,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to make good things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike the studios of many contemporary artists, which are often minimalist affairs, defiantly ahistorical, his is redolent of the past. The front is an art-book-filled office-cum-salon, with walls hung with antique mirrors and vintage photos, including one of Charles Baudelaire, his lodestar; the back is a workshop crowded with stone arms and torsos, piled alongside pieces of old chandeliers used to construct limited-edition light fixtures for spaces like Loulou, the Dirand-designed restaurant in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Frosted with fine plaster dust, the space itself seems sepia-toned, like a Eug\u00e8ne Atget photograph.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Anthonioz and Giacometti shared the belief that there should be no dividing line between decoration and fine art, their aesthetics diverged radically. Giacometti was obsessed with figuration and the natural world \u2014 he spent hours studying birds in the city\u2019s Jardin des Plantes, where Henri Rousseau had once found inspiration \u2014 but Anthonioz has always been driven by abstraction. Giacometti was a master of affixing tiny animals and curling leaves to the bronze framework of his designs, lending them a fey quality; Anthonioz eschews ornament, preferring sleek minimalist shapes. \u201cPeople always speak of me in the same breath as Diego, but I think of Carlo Scarpa, David Smith or even the Bauhaus,\u201d he says.\n\nIndeed, his sculptures have become increasingly monumental in recent years \u2014 the eight-foot-tall \u201cLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e,\u201d a cast-bronze totem, was installed in Pratt Institute\u2019s Brooklyn sculpture garden in 2016 \u2014 so he now works part-time in a lofty second studio in Ivry-sur-Seine, a southeastern suburb. He is also restoring an 18th-century farmhouse in the south, near Aix-en-Provence, where he plans to make work in his later years, in a barn he\u2019s converting into a studio. There, he hopes his five grown children will bring their own kids to run in the fields. \u201cMy work has gotten more abstract, maybe even more modern, as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog on a leash \u2014 not in what I create, and not in how I live my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["tiny", "sculptor", "inside", "work", "wonders", "bronze", "parisian", "18thcentury", "charles", "sculptors", "anthonioz", "studio", "giacometti", "world", "works"], "polarity": 0.1389933820968304, "subjectivity": 0.38793414439966156},

For most of history, it did only what it had to: provide a home when you were away from yours. Then, in the last century, a hotel became a place meant not just for shelter, but a destination; a place that embraced its not-homeness by being better than your home could ever be.\n\nNow, a new project is defining the hotel anew. In September, 700,000 Heures will become the world\u2019s first nomadic hotel. The idea is that a hotel is not an actual structure, but a state of mind, a series of experiences, a respite from your life. Every six months, 700,000 Heures (the approximate length of an average human life in the developed world) will change locations, occupying different buildings in different places \u2014 sometimes an existing building will be reimagined or refit for the hotel\u2019s needs; other times, it might even be built from scratch. First up will be a four-room, 19th-century stone palazzo in Gagliano del Capo, a small town in Salento, Italy, known for its wild beaches and groves of knotted olive trees. Then, after this trial run, the palazzo will be returned to its owner, and 700,000 Heures will move to northwestern Cambodia, where guests will stay in a series of locations, among them an ancient Buddhist temple. Most of the structures the company inhabits will be small \u2014 likely no more than eight rooms in any one location \u2014 and first priority will be given to its several hundred members, who\u2019ll pay an annual 500 euro fee and will be able to opt into destinations as they please. (Those wanting to join can apply through one of 700,000 Heures\u2019 50 approved travel agents.) The company is the invention of a French hotelier named Thierry Teyssier, who over the years has operated small, exquisite hotels in Morocco, Portugal and Brazil. \u201cI want to be able to spend real time with my guests,\u201d he says. \u201c700,000 Heures is personal. It\u2019s the hotel I would like to find, if I were the traveler.\u201d\n\nAlthough 700,000 Heures will be the first impermanent hotel, it finds its origins in a dining and hospitality culture that has become ever more attracted to the ephemeral, the rootless and the rare. The past decade or so has seen a proliferation of pop-up restaurants and shops \u2014 Teyssier made his own contribution to this trend in the form of a pop-up hotel in Paraty, in southern Brazil, which operated for six months in 2014 before shutting down. At the same time, there\u2019s been an embrace of what might be called subscription-based hospitality: In London, there\u2019s Carousel, a restaurant with a constantly rotating series of guest chefs and a set menu each night for which tickets must be purchased in advance, or the membership-based Soho House, which now has 18 locations worldwide. Teyssier\u2019s company speaks to a certain kind of traveler\u2019s desire for both novelty and consistency \u2014 the location might be different, but the mood must always feel familiar.\n\nOne of the ways 700,000 Heures plans to achieve this is through Teyssier\u2019s presence; indeed, he\u2019ll act less as hotelier and more as impresario, remaining on-site through each of the hotel\u2019s incarnations, and organizing excursions and events for all of the guests. In Salento, this might mean a fishing-boat ride through hidden coves along the Adriatic, or a sunset picnic at Santa Maria di Leuca, a little-known Roman sanctuary. In Cambodia, destinations will include Tonle Sap Lake, a biosphere reserve with a floating village of wooden houses, or the French colonial city of Battambang, where travelers can train with acrobats at the renowned Phare Circus. The goal, Teyssier says, is for the guest to feel like an actor in a theatrical production: the natural outgrowth of an age in which vacations are presented like biopics on social media. And, as for an actor, 700,000 Heures also provides props: Along with the physical spaces, Teyssier has created a series of leather trunks \u2014 each filled with objects to create a different mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, from cocktail bar to art studio \u2014 that will appear at all of the hotels and will provide an aesthetic through line. The hotel will also present members with a mock passport, which will be stamped after each trip. \u201cSome people make sculpture,\u201d Teyssier says. \u201cI\u2019m in the business of creating memories.\u201d \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS\n\nImage \u201cCaa Caa\u201d (2017). Credit Bathmat on canvas/photo By Adam Schreiber\n\nHigh-Low\n\nThe artist Andy Coolquitt is always searching through Austin, Tex.\u2019s thrift stores and abandoned lots for eye-catching flotsam, which he then fashions into haute Minimalist sculptures: lamps made of odd loops of metal pipe, or a series of Snuggies, which, stretched across a frame, resemble Blinky Palermo\u2019s fuzzy color fields, but with sleeves. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of focus on craft, technique or finish fetish,\u201d says the 53-year-old artist, who studied at U.C.L.A. and the University of Texas at Austin. Rather, his aim is to poke fun at the imposed distinction between art and life by highlighting an object\u2019s strange journey from useful tool to used-up trash to a thing of value defined by uselessness (art). He even lives inside his longest-running piece \u2014 a multi-building compound in the center of town that, over the course of two decades, he\u2019s filled with work and fellow artists. \u201cInstead of making art about domesticity, I figured I\u2019d just make a house,\u201d he says.\n\nAt an installation opening this spring at the Hotel Indigo in Santa Barbara, Calif. \u2014 a satellite space of the Santa Barbara Museum of Contemporary Art \u2014 visitors, too, can live among Coolquitt\u2019s work, about 25 pieces of which will fill the building\u2019s lobby and hallways. Coolquitt, who\u2019s shown everywhere from New York\u2019s Marianne Boesky Gallery to the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, believes a show should reflect its context. In this non-gallery setting, he saw an opportunity to be playful \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not really into confronting people with difficult ideas while they\u2019re on vacation,\u201d he says. That means synthetic pink wigs draped over lamps, a canvas affixed with bathrobe belts arrayed in clean vertical stripes and rectilinear wall hangings made of colorful bathmats (shown above) \u2014 the rare study in geometric abstraction where the polygons are plush. \u2014 SAM DEAN\n\nRunway Report: Logos a Go-Go\n\nImage Credit Illustrations by Jean-Michel Tixier\n\nFrom left: Comme des Garc\u0327ons Shirt Boys, $275, (212) 604-9200.

In 2016, after stints at the French Laundry and Northcote, his father\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant in Lancashire, England, the now-30-year-old British chef was diagnosed with Lyme disease and forced to take a break from his work. After noticing that heavy, processed foods exacerbated his symptoms, he started experimenting with a vegan diet. \u201cNow I treat myself through food and natural remedies alone; I don\u2019t take any pain medication,\u201d he says. With Plates, a plant-based restaurant he\u2019s opening with his sister Keeley in London\u2019s Shoreditch neighborhood, he\u2019ll share his findings with an increasingly wellness-minded public, though this is hardly another juice-and-avocado-toast joint. Haworth\u2019s complex, cerebral dishes are grounded in classic techniques: In one, beetroot is salt-baked like beef with juniper and thyme, and then topped with fermented berries, avocado and fennel pollen from the nearby Hackney Marshes. Other standouts include a radicchio salad flavored with agave and wild blackberry vinegar (shown above) and a wild mushroom broth with immune-boosting shiitake, kombu and baked celeriac. \u201cIt can take weeks to replicate the richness of a sauce without butter, or to balance acidity without sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be intelligent with vegetables.\u201d \u2014 AIMEE FARRELL\n\nSign up for the Open Thread Newsletter A look from across the New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

Since the 1800s, doctors had been prescribing hydrotherapy, and health resorts were being established across the continent. As the historian David Clay Large has written, \u201cthe grand spas in their heyday amounted to their world\u2019s equivalent of today\u2019s golf and tennis resorts, conference centers, business retreats, political summits, fashion shows, theme parks and sexual hideaways \u2014 all rolled into one.\u201d\n\nPeople afflicted with everything from gout to arthritis came to \u201ctake the waters\u201d at spa towns across Europe, but unlike the sanatoriums with which they were concurrent, their visitors were not always ill. Instead they came to socialize, attend cultural events and negotiate political treaties. The towns themselves \u2014 Aix-les-Bains and Vichy in France; Bath and Buxton in England; Aachen and Baden-Baden in Germany \u2014 built above the rubble of thermal baths established by Roman conquerors centuries earlier, were plotted to maximize what was known as a \u201ctherapeutic landscape,\u201d a kind of aestheticized social engineering that promoted strolling and alfresco mingling. The architectural style of the bathhouses themselves was formal and atavistic, with marble walls, high arches, domed ceilings and mosaic floors. Well-maintained, infrastructurally sophisticated and aggressively promoted, these grand spa complexes were some of the earliest examples of modern tourist destinations.\n\nPhoto\n\nYEARS BEFORE THE concept of a politically and culturally unified Europe gained traction, withdrawing from life (if even for a week) was a recurring feature of Continental existence. Spa culture \u2014 defined by its intentional architecture, geographical remove and somnambulistic ambience \u2014 was experienced in direct opposition to the rapid-paced, sick-making atmosphere of industrialized Europe. Unlike in America, where tuberculosis sanatoriums functioned more like hospitals than lifestyle colonies, the bosky outreaches of central Europe served as a sort of mystical destination where people from kingdoms near and far could live temporarily apart from reality \u2014 intermingling, arguing, falling in love \u2014 even as the security and sovereignty of the world around them remained imperiled. It\u2019s unsurprising that a microcosm containing different types of people with little to do but reflect and cathect provided fiction writers with a generative setting, one which everyone from George Eliot to Henry James to Guy de Maupassant took advantage of.\n\nIndeed, with enough selective reading it can seem as though every 19th-century writer of note spent at least a little time at a spa town. Turgenev and Goethe took the waters at Karlovy Vary in western Bohemia; Dickens and Tennyson visited Yorkshire\u2019s Harrogate. The Black Forest-surrounded Baden-Baden was perhaps the most popular, especially among the Russians: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky both visited; Chekhov died 90 miles south of there in Badenweiler in 1904 after an injection of camphor, a sip of champagne and a few weeks of writing letters to his sister in which he described his diet (boiled mutton, strawberry tea and \u201cenormous quantities\u201d of butter) and complained about German women\u2019s poor taste in clothing. His body was brought home in a refrigerator car meant for oysters. Mark Twain visited the Bohemian spa town of Marianske Lazne (often referred to by its German name, Marienbad) in 1892 and sarcastically cataloged a spa regimen for a patient suffering from gout that involved rising at 5:30 a.m., drinking \u201cdreadful\u201d water, tramping in the hills, wallowing in the mud and eating as much as possible \u201cso long as he is careful and eats only such things as he doesn\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nMy daily routine in Marianske Lazne wasn\u2019t actually so different. It began with a walk through the small, central part of the village, whose springs have been touted as curative for centuries and which was visited by an almost-laughable list of luminaries that included state heads (Czar Nicholas II, Emperor Franz Josef I), intellectuals (Freud, Edison, Kafka, Nietzsche, Kipling) and composers (Mahler, Wagner, Chopin, Strauss). The town is made up of pale neo-Classical buildings edged with verdigrised turrets and elaborate spires. The public gardens are tidy and politely pretty. Czech couples stroll along camel-colored crushed-granite paths, carrying flattened porcelain spa cups whose handles also serve as straws and which they fill at public fountains. Large groups of Germans walk briskly in excessive hiking gear, stopping at outdoor cafes where they order steins of pilsner and read Der Spiegel. The Russians wear their bathrobes everywhere and keep to the gilded hotel lobbies, where they play chess with one another as mole-removal videos loop on overhead TVs. At the grand hotels, whose convoluted floor plans also house spas, sublimated weight loss strategies are nonexistent, as are the high-tech instruments and the suggestions of pan-Asian wellness (gongs, bamboo) that one sees everywhere in America. In the absence of vanity and hard science and globalism, a sort of generic and primal prewar Europeanness persists, as unsettling as it is soothing.\n\nAnd as Twain himself reported, the meals were indeed curious and the prescriptions harebrained. At the Danubius Health Spa Resort Centralni Lazne, treatments are administered in tiled, cobweb-laced rooms. My first was a \u201cmineral bath with natural CO2\u201d for which I was led into a stainless-steel bathtub by a caustic attendant and told to ignore a half-submerged rusty wire. The water, just above lukewarm and smelling of sulfur, fizzed lightly. I had the impression of floating in rapidly cooling club soda. The attendant came back in, unannounced, wrapped me in a blanket, and discouraged me from trying to remove an arm so I could read my book. Benefits are said to include \u201cimproved blood circulation, heart and kidney activity as well as reduced stress and anxiety.\u201d Later, I dawdled in a Kneipp foot bath, named for a Bavarian priest who advised walking without shoes through morning dew, and the following day spent a disturbing 30 minutes in a tiled alcove, while dry oxygen was delivered into my nostrils via a latex tube. Each evening, a heavy dinner was served (often including hot sauerkraut, beef tongue in cream sauce, pickled herring and, for dessert, whole peeled kiwis), followed by flutes of Bohemian sparkling wine, which one could sip while classical musicians performed.\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE SANATORIUMS OF Europe are now closed, and the spa towns where acute and imagined maladies alike were elevated to a glamorous lifestyle are today visited almost exclusively by the elderly. But medically informed repose \u2014 experienced far and away from the world, quietly and alongside others as sick (or not) as oneself \u2014 can still be had. In Vals, Switzerland, not 70 miles from Davos (once studded with about 40 sanatoriums), thermal waters run through the valley\u2019s granite walls. A beautiful if deliberately sterile-feeling spa hotel sits just above the small village and beckons visitors from all over the world, who come to bathe in silence and eat overpriced pear bread while gazing at verdant pastures. Those seeking wellness today do not want outdoor concerts or lectures or chitchat. They want to be by themselves, ideally in a photogenic location with poor cellphone service.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe walls of the Peter Zumthor-designed spa, opened in 1996 under the name Therme Vals and now part of the 7132 Hotel, are made from 60,000 one-meter-long slabs of locally quarried quartzite; the concrete roof is covered with grass. Giant windows overlooking gray mountains somehow don\u2019t do much to brighten what is otherwise a dark and labyrinthine experience. \u201cMoving around this space means making discoveries,\u201d Zumthor has said. \u201cYou are walking as if in the woods. Everyone there is looking for a path of their own.\u201d\n\nI often wondered if I would ever find mine. I spent as much time soaking in various baths as I did wandering around through the mist between them. It was easy to appreciate the solemn beauty of Vals\u2019s imposing modern design, which was clearly plotted with great intention and intellect, while still feeling unpleasant panic each time you rounded a corner only to see a dim hallway coaxing you who knows where. Before the property owner stepped in and insisted otherwise, Zumthor was adamant that his spa have no clocks inside. He wanted bathers to feel not just weightless in the water but timeless too. The twin clocks that were installed are nearly hidden (I only found out about them weeks after I had come home) and the cavernous space succeeds in making the minutes melt into hours.\n\nIn daily life, it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t know the time down to the minute, and with the tap of a single skeuomorphic button I can find out where I am anywhere in the world, as well as whatever terrible things are happening halfway around it. In previous centuries, those suffering from ailments and ennui could travel through forests and up glaciers, by train and horse, to drink and dip in therapeutic waters. They endured unthinkable hassle to gain access to legendary liquids and dubious expertise. Today, we know better. Sunlight doesn\u2019t kill germs and physical maladies aren\u2019t cured by carbonated water. The best we can hope for is the kind of psychological balm that comes from temporarily removing oneself from the responsibilities of daily life, which lately seem to involve the helpless monitoring of catastrophes we can do nothing about.
