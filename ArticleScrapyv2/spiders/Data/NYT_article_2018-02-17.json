The move gave him 215.08 points, enough to win the long program portion of the competition. But his poor showing in the short program kept him off the podium.\n\nChen, 18, who had been an American hope for a gold, had initially planned to perform five quads, but it was \u201calmost a game-time decision\u201d to add a sixth, he said.\n\n\u201cI knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose, so I decided just to try it,\u201d Chen said.\n\nBecause quad jumps have the highest base values in figure skating, there is a powerful incentive for skaters to try quads in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jumps.

As a result, the best American players are back home, while Russia has a roster filled with members of its Kontinental Hockey League, including the former N.H.L. stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk. The Russian team is the favorite on paper, but it has a history of underperforming at the Olympics of late.\n\nThen there is Donato, a junior at Harvard and the son of Ted Donato, the Harvard coach and a former N.H.L. and United States national team player.

The most celebrated example was Jong Song-ok, who won the World Championships marathon in Spain in 1999.\n\nMs. Jong famously said she won because while running, she imagined Kim Jong-il, then North Korea\u2019s leader, \u201cbeckoning me from the finish line.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim, the father of the current leader, made her a \u201chero of the republic,\u201d the highest honor in the country, for lifting the morale of his people still, in the grip of a devastating famine. (Defectors from the North later relayed a different story: Ms. Jong, sent to Spain as a pacemaker for another North Korean runner, ran for the life of her father, who was in prison.)\n\nThis year, Kim Jong-un has no athlete who can glorify him as Ms. Jong did his father.\n\nNorth Korea has won only two medals in the Winter Olympics, a silver in speedskating in 1964 and a bronze in short-track speedskating in 1992. The International Olympic Committee granted the 22 North Koreans at the current games last-minute exemptions to compete in five sports in Pyeongchang, including a dozen who joined the South Korean women\u2019s ice hockey squad to create the first inter-Korean Olympic team ever. None is expected to stand on a medal podium.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut Mr. Kim had quite a different goal for the Olympics, analysts said.\n\nWhen he used his New Year\u2019s Day speech to propose sending North Korean athletes to the Olympics, it was clear that his interest was not in Olympic golds but in creating a political d\u00e9tente so he could weaken international sanctions imposed on his country. At home, he described his decision as an act of magnanimity.\n\nSouth Koreans \u201care so grateful to us for giving a helping hand to their Winter Games, which were at the risk of becoming the least popular Olympics in history because of the political situation,\u201d the North\u2019s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said last month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSouth Korea has repeatedly urged North Korea to join the Olympics, hoping that its participation would help ease tensions and help make the games a success. That created an opening for Mr. Kim to engage in what critics called a \u201ccharm offensive.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim sent hundreds of cheerleaders, musicians and singers to the Games to supplement his meager sports contingent. They stole much of the show on the sidelines of the games. He also sent the most unusual Olympic guest: his sister, whose visit to the South, including meetings with President Moon Jae-in, created a media frenzy. Ms. Kim delivered her brother\u2019s invitation for Mr. Moon to visit the North for a summit meeting, raising hopes for a d\u00e9tente, as Mr. Kim intended.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un didn\u2019t really have anyone to send to the Olympics, except for his cheerleaders and singers,\u201d said Joo Sung-ha, a North Korean defector who works as a reporter for the mass-circulation South Korean daily Dong-A Ilbo. \u201cThey were the best card he had.\u201d\n\nThe state-run North Korean news outlets covering the Olympics focused on these nonsports activities to highlight Mr. Kim\u2019s inter-Korean initiative.\n\nThey carried front-page reports on his sister\u2019s visit. They told North Koreans that their arts troupe performed to \u201cpacked audiences\u201d in the South. They also reported the North Korean cheerleaders rooting for the joint Korean ice hockey team but did not mention that it lost 8-0 to Switzerland and Sweden. The team also lost 4-1 to Japan, the Koreans\u2019 historical enemy, on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cKim Jong-un did not look for Olympic golds in the first place,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cHis aim was to use the Olympics to create a mood for dialogue in order to head off sanctions and pressure and to soften his country\u2019s negative image.

Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway described completing his gold medal run in the men\u2019s downhill on Thursday in front of a mostly empty grandstand as \u201ca little bit strange.\u201d\n\nThe low attendance may be partly attributed to the fact that South Korea does not have a culture of Alpine sports. It has achieved Winter Olympic success in just two events, speedskating and figure skating.\n\nAt some Games in other countries, locals have packed venues to watch unfamiliar sports just to be a part of the experience. That has not happened here. A near-capacity crowd watched the short-track speedskater Lim Hyo-jun secure South Korea\u2019s first gold medal on Saturday, but less popular events are taking place in front of blocks of empty seats.\n\n\u201cIf we had this race in Italy, Austria, Norway, Sweden, it would be packed with 50,000 people,\u201d Svindal said. To be fair, he said, he doubted people in Norway would fill an arena for short-track speedskating, like they did here, but he still wished he had won his medal amid a more raucous atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad.\u201d\n\nEmpty seats are not a problem unique to the Pyeongchang Games. Organizers of the last two Olympics \u2014 in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and Sochi two years earlier \u2014 also found themselves under scrutiny as images of half-empty venues were beamed worldwide.\n\nUnused seats reserved for sponsors and athletes were blamed then. Organizers are doing the same here. \u201cWe find they are the empty seats,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Pyeongchang 2018, though it is unlikely that is the lone explanation. Organizers continue to advertise the Games and are actively encouraging fans to buy tickets on-site.\n\nHeightened political tension between North Korea and the United States in the buildup to the Games did not help sales. Less than six months before the Games opened, President Trump threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea in response to a spate of missile tests by the North.

Lee cried as he photographed the opening of the Winter Olympic Games.\n\nHe had grown up in Busan, South Korea, where his parents rarely spoke about the war that cleaved his homeland in two. His mother had fled the North, leaving behind family members; his paternal uncle was never seen again after being taken prisoner by the North. In elementary school, his teachers had him draw posters and write essays against the communists.\n\nNow, in an emotional homecoming he could never have imagined, Mr. Lee has returned to cover the Winter Games for The New York Times. Even harder to believe was the sight of a unified team of women hockey players from North and South Korea as they entered the stadium.\n\nImage North Korea supporters during the game between the unified Korean team and Switzerland at Kwandong Hockey Center.

And even though the 1988 Summer Games were in Seoul, he didn\u2019t have the time to watch them on television, since he was busy delivering pizzas in New Jersey to pay his way through English classes. He just knew something big was happening.\n\n\u201cI heard people screaming from their homes,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I was just delivering the pizza.\u201d\n\nHe went on to study photography at New York University and landed a photo internship at The Times in 1994 before being promoted to staff photographer a few months later. And though he started with little knowledge of many American sports, he quickly became an expert sports photographer. He covered his first Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in 1998, where the spectacle and the drama motivated him to photograph as many Olympic Games as possible ever since.\n\nImage Adam Rippon of the United States during the men\u2019s singles free skate, on the final day of the team figure skating competition. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\n\u201cI love to cover the Olympics because it\u2019s really about human drama,\u201d he said. \u201cThese athletes go through extreme hardship and devote so much of their lives to compete in a short period of time that will define their career. To witness that and to be able to capture those moments is a great gift to me and a privilege to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nHis obsession with capturing the perfect moment at the Olympics at times rivals the obsession of the athletes themselves. Two thirds of his job, he said, is making sure everything is working so he can actually take the pictures the rest of the time.\n\nAt these Olympics, his focus will be on figure skating and ice hockey. Mr. Lee has set up two remote cameras at the skating arena and two more at the hockey rink. He had already scouted the figure skating venue in Pyeongchang a year ago in order to familiarize himself with the location. He also went to the American figure skating trials in order to study the athletes and their routines.\n\nImage Shaun White of the United States during the men\u2019s halfpipe qualification rounds at Phoenix Snow Park, PyeongChang.

There is a purely meditative aspect to being a great sports photographer and a feeling of being solely in the moment. Anticipation is critical for capturing the moments that happen so fast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really being able to see what\u2019s going to happen before it happens,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf you wait until you see it with your own eyes, many times it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nImage North Korean figure skaters Kim Ju-Sik and Ryom Tae-Ok during a practice session.

In November, Chen spoke by phone with Li for performance advice and to understand the dancer\u2019s motivation. He gained a deep appreciation of Li\u2019s perseverance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot of pain and struggles, and maybe that\u2019s not super parallel to my life,\u201d Chen said in a series of interviews over several months. \u201cBut I think that mentality of pushing through anything is something I can relate to. Li is incredibly tough; nothing fazes him. That\u2019s something I can definitely learn from and not let my emotions get in the way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018The Best of the Best\u2019\n\nWith a breakout season a year ago, and a sixth-place finish at the 2017 world championships last spring, Chen displayed more artistry, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Tara Lipinski, the 1998 women\u2019s Olympic champion who is now an NBC commentator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first time she saw Chen this year, Lipinski said, she was shocked by his artistic improvement.\n\n\u201cIt takes a few years, sometimes, to do that,\u201d she added. \u201cBut he does have ballet training. That helps. He has a beautiful, classic line.\u201d\n\nIn the buildup to the Olympics, Chen was the only undefeated skater on the international Grand Prix circuit. This is his moment. There is no certainty that he will be healthy or interested in skating in four years for the next Olympics. A proposed rule that devalues quad jumps could be implemented after these Games. Everything he does now has a kind of fevered urgency.\n\n\u201cTo put it all together, he knows he doesn\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d Lipinski said. \u201cHe\u2019s balancing out that technical and artistic side to give himself a chance to win.\u201d\n\nFor his short program, which he will perform Friday, Chen worked with the choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne, the 2003 world ice dancing champion from Canada. The propulsive music is experimental pop by Benjamin Clementine. The song title \u2014 \u201cNemesis\u201d \u2014 was not purposely meant to suggest rivalry with the reigning Olympic champion, Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, but it hints at Chen\u2019s aspiration and distinguishes him from his rivals who are skating to classical pieces.\n\nHis costume is a unitard that has no sequins, giving Chen the unadorned athletic look of a bobsledder or speed skater. White lines on the chest and arms give form to his two quad jumps and powerful, angular movement.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for him. He\u2019s passionate. He emotes all the way through,\u201d Johnny Weir, a two-time Olympian and Lipinski\u2019s announcing partner on NBC, said of Chen\u2019s short program. \u201cHe can reach the top rafter of a building. Ultimately, that\u2019s what an artist has to do; you have to sell to the cheap seats.\u201d\n\nChen\u2019s long program is a more sweeping routine of character development, emotion and storytelling. It was choreographed by Lori Nichol of Toronto, who is perhaps best known for her work with the Americans Michelle Kwan, a five-time world champion and two-time Olympic medalist, and Evan Lysacek, the 2010 Olympic champion.\n\n\u201cI want to be a full-package skater,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to work with the best of the best.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, it took some convincing by Nichol to persuade Chen to skate to \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer.\u201d\n\nHe worried that a routine about a dancer who defected from China might put off some judges. The scoring in skating has grown more impartial, but it is far from being fully objective. A differential of a point, or even half a point, can make all the difference when it comes to awarding medals.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a little too political,\u201d Chen said.\n\nLi, the dancer whom Chen is portraying, was the sixth of seven sons in a family of peasants in Shandong Province. He was born in 1961, during a catastrophic period known as the Great Leap Forward, when Mao Zedong\u2019s program of industrialization and agricultural collectivization resulted in famine and tens of millions of deaths. Chen\u2019s parents were also born in that period.\n\nLi\u2019s chance to escape his fate came at age 11 in 1972, when four cultural advisers from the Beijing Dance Academy came to his school, an unheated classroom made of mud. Madame Mao, Jiang Qing, was the academy\u2019s honorary artistic director. Of about one million children scouted throughout China, only 44 were chosen, Li said in an interview. His selection was almost accidental, he said, with his teacher pointing to him and saying, \u201cWhat about that one?\u201d as the advisers were leaving the classroom.\n\nAs the advisers tested his flexibility, Li said, they tore hamstring muscles in both of his legs. He swallowed the pain, he said, instead of letting on. He had grown up in such dire conditions, threatened by starvation, each day a matter of survival, he said, that \u201cwhat I had to suffer with torn hamstrings was nothing.\u201d\n\nAt the Beijing Dance Academy, Li honed his jumping skills by tying sandbags to his legs and bounding up four flights of stairs. And he trained extra hours by candlelight to overcome dizziness while spinning.\n\nIn 1979, he was allowed to travel on a cultural exchange to perform with the Houston Ballet. He experienced the freedom to dance for artistry\u2019s sake and not simply for political propaganda. He also fell in love with another dancer and married in 1981 as he was scheduled to return to China. Instead, he defected. He was detained for 21 hours in the Chinese consulate in Houston before being released.\n\nEventually, Li\u2019s parents were granted permission to make a surprise visit to see him dance in Houston, and he was permitted to return to China. Today, Li, 57, is artistic director of the Queensland Ballet in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nDespite Chen\u2019s reluctance to portray Li, Nichol persisted. She checked with friends in China. The movie and Li\u2019s memoir were readily available there, Nichol was told. They seemed acceptable to the Chinese government and would not be politically sensitive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was able to lay that concern to rest,\u201d Nichol said in a telephone interview from Toronto.\n\nBut Chen needed more convincing.", "keywords": ["program", "olympic", "nichol", "chens", "chen", "nathan", "shuns", "china", "li", "thats", "sequins", "skating", "dancer"], "polarity": 0.21493182743182743, "subjectivity": 0.4666140373036925},

The move gave him 215.08 points, enough to win the long program portion of the competition. But his poor showing in the short program kept him off the podium.\n\nChen, 18, who had been an American hope for a gold, had initially planned to perform five quads, but it was \u201calmost a game-time decision\u201d to add a sixth, he said.\n\n\u201cI knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose, so I decided just to try it,\u201d Chen said.\n\nBecause quad jumps have the highest base values in figure skating, there is a powerful incentive for skaters to try quads in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jumps. Sixteen of the 24 skaters on Saturday attempted at least one quad.\n\nQuadruple Jumps Attempted in the Long Program Note: Judges score each element on a scale from \u20133 to +3.

We are throwing out the scores of the highest and lowest judges, just as it is done in the official scoring system. Skaters who did not attempt quads are not shown.\n\nChen performed two more quads than Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, who defended his Olympic title, winning his second straight gold medal in the event on Saturday.

In addition to points for technical elements like quads, skaters also receive marks for the quality of their skating, called the \u201cprogram components\u201d score.

We are throwing out the scores of the highest and lowest judges, just as it is done in the official scoring system. Skaters who did not attempt quads are not shown.\n\nA quad, which is a jump that has four revolutions, has the highest base value in figure skating and is generally worth more than twice the equivalent triple jump. For example, a triple lutz has a base value of 6 points. A quad lutz is worth 13.6 points.\n\nThis creates a powerful incentive for skaters to try a quad in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jump.\n\nSkaters also gain or lose additional points depending on how well the quad is executed. And any jump done in the second half of a program, when skaters\u2019 legs are tired, gets a 10 percent bonus.\n\nFor example, below are the 13 elements of the long program of Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, performed at the 2017 world championships, in the order that he executed them.

As a result, the best American players are back home, while Russia has a roster filled with members of its Kontinental Hockey League, including the former N.H.L. stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk. The Russian team is the favorite on paper, but it has a history of underperforming at the Olympics of late.\n\nThen there is Donato, a junior at Harvard and the son of Ted Donato, the Harvard coach and a former N.H.L. and United States national team player. Donato may be the top player on the American squad and may end up playing for the Boston Bruins by the spring.

Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway described completing his gold medal run in the men\u2019s downhill on Thursday in front of a mostly empty grandstand as \u201ca little bit strange.\u201d\n\nThe low attendance may be partly attributed to the fact that South Korea does not have a culture of Alpine sports. It has achieved Winter Olympic success in just two events, speedskating and figure skating.\n\nAt some Games in other countries, locals have packed venues to watch unfamiliar sports just to be a part of the experience. That has not happened here. A near-capacity crowd watched the short-track speedskater Lim Hyo-jun secure South Korea\u2019s first gold medal on Saturday, but less popular events are taking place in front of blocks of empty seats.\n\n\u201cIf we had this race in Italy, Austria, Norway, Sweden, it would be packed with 50,000 people,\u201d Svindal said. To be fair, he said, he doubted people in Norway would fill an arena for short-track speedskating, like they did here, but he still wished he had won his medal amid a more raucous atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad.\u201d\n\nEmpty seats are not a problem unique to the Pyeongchang Games. Organizers of the last two Olympics \u2014 in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and Sochi two years earlier \u2014 also found themselves under scrutiny as images of half-empty venues were beamed worldwide.\n\nUnused seats reserved for sponsors and athletes were blamed then. Organizers are doing the same here. \u201cWe find they are the empty seats,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Pyeongchang 2018, though it is unlikely that is the lone explanation.

Lee cried as he photographed the opening of the Winter Olympic Games.\n\nHe had grown up in Busan, South Korea, where his parents rarely spoke about the war that cleaved his homeland in two. His mother had fled the North, leaving behind family members; his paternal uncle was never seen again after being taken prisoner by the North. In elementary school, his teachers had him draw posters and write essays against the communists.\n\nNow, in an emotional homecoming he could never have imagined, Mr. Lee has returned to cover the Winter Games for The New York Times. Even harder to believe was the sight of a unified team of women hockey players from North and South Korea as they entered the stadium.\n\nImage North Korea supporters during the game between the unified Korean team and Switzerland at Kwandong Hockey Center.

Lee/The New York Times\n\n\u201cWe are the same people,\u201d Mr. Lee said in a phone call from Korea this week. \u201cUnification will probably not happen anytime soon but we don\u2019t have to be literally unified to be able to communicate with our relatives on the other side and have activities together.\u201d\n\nThese are the eighth Olympics Mr. Lee has covered for The New York Times, even though he had little interest in sports when he moved to the United States after a semester of college. And even though the 1988 Summer Games were in Seoul, he didn\u2019t have the time to watch them on television, since he was busy delivering pizzas in New Jersey to pay his way through English classes. He just knew something big was happening.\n\n\u201cI heard people screaming from their homes,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I was just delivering the pizza.\u201d\n\nHe went on to study photography at New York University and landed a photo internship at The Times in 1994 before being promoted to staff photographer a few months later. And though he started with little knowledge of many American sports, he quickly became an expert sports photographer. He covered his first Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in 1998, where the spectacle and the drama motivated him to photograph as many Olympic Games as possible ever since.\n\nImage Adam Rippon of the United States during the men\u2019s singles free skate, on the final day of the team figure skating competition. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\n\u201cI love to cover the Olympics because it\u2019s really about human drama,\u201d he said. \u201cThese athletes go through extreme hardship and devote so much of their lives to compete in a short period of time that will define their career. To witness that and to be able to capture those moments is a great gift to me and a privilege to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nHis obsession with capturing the perfect moment at the Olympics at times rivals the obsession of the athletes themselves. Two thirds of his job, he said, is making sure everything is working so he can actually take the pictures the rest of the time.\n\nAt these Olympics, his focus will be on figure skating and ice hockey. Mr. Lee has set up two remote cameras at the skating arena and two more at the hockey rink. He had already scouted the figure skating venue in Pyeongchang a year ago in order to familiarize himself with the location. He also went to the American figure skating trials in order to study the athletes and their routines.\n\nImage Shaun White of the United States during the men\u2019s halfpipe qualification rounds at Phoenix Snow Park, PyeongChang.

There is a purely meditative aspect to being a great sports photographer and a feeling of being solely in the moment. Anticipation is critical for capturing the moments that happen so fast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really being able to see what\u2019s going to happen before it happens,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf you wait until you see it with your own eyes, many times it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nImage North Korean figure skaters Kim Ju-Sik and Ryom Tae-Ok during a practice session.

But quads alone will not put him atop the medal podium.\n\nSkating\u2019s scoring system requires a ravenous accumulation of points for victory and assigns a numerical value to every element of a performance: jumps; spins; the flow, glide and intricacy of footwork; the translation of music and choreography into performance; and the purpose and design of movement across the ice.\n\nSo Chen, who took classical ballet classes for six years as a boy, spent months training for the 2018 Winter Olympics with a plan for evolution on the ice as much as revolution in the air.\n\nImage Chen\u2019s costumes are designed by Vera Wang. In his short program, he skates to experimental pop music while his rivals use classical pieces. Credit Mladen Antonov/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nSeeking a more even balance of athleticism and artistry, Chen worked with two renowned skating choreographers, consulted a blade specialist to refine the edge control of his skating and hired Vera Wang to design his costumes. He even cut the youthful wave from his hair, seeking to appear more mature and purposeful.\n\n\u201cThe curl is gone, but I guess that makes me more aerodynamic, so that\u2019s all right,\u201d Chen joked last month at the United States championships.\n\nAfter some hesitancy, given the subjective nature of skating, a sport in which judges determine winners and can reprove what they consider to be overtly political acts, Chen decided for his Olympic free skate to perform to the music from the 2009 movie \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer.\u201d\n\nIt is based on a memoir of the same name that depicts the harsh childhood, unexpected discovery, wrenching familial separation, and ultimate liberation and triumph of the dancer Li Cunxin.\n\nThe story bears some loose parallels to the immigration of Chen\u2019s parents from China as they sought careers in the medical field. In November, Chen spoke by phone with Li for performance advice and to understand the dancer\u2019s motivation. He gained a deep appreciation of Li\u2019s perseverance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot of pain and struggles, and maybe that\u2019s not super parallel to my life,\u201d Chen said in a series of interviews over several months. \u201cBut I think that mentality of pushing through anything is something I can relate to. Li is incredibly tough; nothing fazes him. That\u2019s something I can definitely learn from and not let my emotions get in the way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018The Best of the Best\u2019\n\nWith a breakout season a year ago, and a sixth-place finish at the 2017 world championships last spring, Chen displayed more artistry, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Tara Lipinski, the 1998 women\u2019s Olympic champion who is now an NBC commentator.\n\nThe first time she saw Chen this year, Lipinski said, she was shocked by his artistic improvement.\n\n\u201cIt takes a few years, sometimes, to do that,\u201d she added. \u201cBut he does have ballet training. That helps. He has a beautiful, classic line.\u201d\n\nIn the buildup to the Olympics, Chen was the only undefeated skater on the international Grand Prix circuit. This is his moment. There is no certainty that he will be healthy or interested in skating in four years for the next Olympics. A proposed rule that devalues quad jumps could be implemented after these Games. Everything he does now has a kind of fevered urgency.\n\n\u201cTo put it all together, he knows he doesn\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d Lipinski said. \u201cHe\u2019s balancing out that technical and artistic side to give himself a chance to win.\u201d\n\nImage Chen\u2019s long program uses music from the movie \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer,\u201d which tells the story of Li Cunxin, right, who defected from China and became a principal dancer for the Houston Ballet. Credit Bettmann Archive, via Getty Images\n\nFor his short program, which he will perform Friday, Chen worked with the choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne, the 2003 world ice dancing champion from Canada. The propulsive music is experimental pop by Benjamin Clementine. The song title \u2014 \u201cNemesis\u201d \u2014 was not purposely meant to suggest rivalry with the reigning Olympic champion, Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, but it hints at Chen\u2019s aspiration and distinguishes him from his rivals who are skating to classical pieces.\n\nHis costume is a unitard that has no sequins, giving Chen the unadorned athletic look of a bobsledder or speed skater. White lines on the chest and arms give form to his two quad jumps and powerful, angular movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect for him. He\u2019s passionate. He emotes all the way through,\u201d Johnny Weir, a two-time Olympian and Lipinski\u2019s announcing partner on NBC, said of Chen\u2019s short program. \u201cHe can reach the top rafter of a building. Ultimately, that\u2019s what an artist has to do; you have to sell to the cheap seats.\u201d\n\nChen\u2019s long program is a more sweeping routine of character development, emotion and storytelling. It was choreographed by Lori Nichol of Toronto, who is perhaps best known for her work with the Americans Michelle Kwan, a five-time world champion and two-time Olympic medalist, and Evan Lysacek, the 2010 Olympic champion.\n\n\u201cI want to be a full-package skater,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to work with the best of the best.\u201d\n\nStill, it took some convincing by Nichol to persuade Chen to skate to \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer.\u201d\n\nHe worried that a routine about a dancer who defected from China might put off some judges. The scoring in skating has grown more impartial, but it is far from being fully objective. A differential of a point, or even half a point, can make all the difference when it comes to awarding medals.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a little too political,\u201d Chen said.\n\nLi, the dancer whom Chen is portraying, was the sixth of seven sons in a family of peasants in Shandong Province. He was born in 1961, during a catastrophic period known as the Great Leap Forward, when Mao Zedong\u2019s program of industrialization and agricultural collectivization resulted in famine and tens of millions of deaths. Chen\u2019s parents were also born in that period.\n\nLi\u2019s chance to escape his fate came at age 11 in 1972, when four cultural advisers from the Beijing Dance Academy came to his school, an unheated classroom made of mud. Madame Mao, Jiang Qing, was the academy\u2019s honorary artistic director. Of about one million children scouted throughout China, only 44 were chosen, Li said in an interview. His selection was almost accidental, he said, with his teacher pointing to him and saying, \u201cWhat about that one?\u201d as the advisers were leaving the classroom.\n\nAs the advisers tested his flexibility, Li said, they tore hamstring muscles in both of his legs. He swallowed the pain, he said, instead of letting on. He had grown up in such dire conditions, threatened by starvation, each day a matter of survival, he said, that \u201cwhat I had to suffer with torn hamstrings was nothing.\u201d\n\nAt the Beijing Dance Academy, Li honed his jumping skills by tying sandbags to his legs and bounding up four flights of stairs. And he trained extra hours by candlelight to overcome dizziness while spinning.\n\nImage Left, Chen, 14, competing as junior in a Grand Prix event in 2013.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nIn 1979, he was allowed to travel on a cultural exchange to perform with the Houston Ballet. He experienced the freedom to dance for artistry\u2019s sake and not simply for political propaganda. He also fell in love with another dancer and married in 1981 as he was scheduled to return to China. Instead, he defected. He was detained for 21 hours in the Chinese consulate in Houston before being released.\n\nEventually, Li\u2019s parents were granted permission to make a surprise visit to see him dance in Houston, and he was permitted to return to China. Today, Li, 57, is artistic director of the Queensland Ballet in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nDespite Chen\u2019s reluctance to portray Li, Nichol persisted. She checked with friends in China. The movie and Li\u2019s memoir were readily available there, Nichol was told. They seemed acceptable to the Chinese government and would not be politically sensitive.\n\n\u201cI was able to lay that concern to rest,\u201d Nichol said in a telephone interview from Toronto.\n\nBut Chen needed more convincing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very American,\u201d he told Nichol. \u201cI can\u2019t really relate to this character very much.\u201d\n\nYes, Nichol replied, but Chen could pay homage to his parents\u2019 immigration in 1988 from Tianjin, China, to Carbondale, Ill., and, four years later, their move to Salt Lake City. His parents did not defect, as did Li, but arrived on his father\u2019s student visa. They sought not political asylum but opportunity. Still, it was not an easy journey and they felt acute dislocation. His mother spoke no English when they came to the United States, and the couple knew no one.\n\nHetty Wang, Chen\u2019s mother, now works as a medical interpreter of Mandarin Chinese for hospitals. His father, Zhidong Chen, had obtained his medical degree in China and later got his doctorate in pharmaceuticals from the University of Utah. He owns a small biotech company.\n\n\u201cThey tend not to talk too much about their struggles, but it must have been so difficult, coming to a new country, not speaking the language, not having much money, not having any friends,\u201d said Nathan Chen, the youngest of five siblings. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how they were able to fight through that.\u201d\n\nFinally, Nichol convinced Chen to perform to \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer\u201d with a line she read in The Globe and Mail\u2019s review of the movie. As Li\u2019s story unfolded, the review said, \u201cpolitics stepped aside to let art do what it does best \u2014 defy boundaries.\u201d\n\nIn a metaphorical sense, Chen would be confronting the perceived limits placed on all skaters who are magnificent jumpers.\n\n\u201cI felt he could defy boundaries of people saying, \u2018You can\u2019t possibly do all those quads and have artistic merit,\u2019\u201d Nichol said.\n\nImage Lori Nichol, a skating choreographer, in 2010. She has also worked with the American champions Michelle Kwan and Evan Lysacek. \u201cI wanted to work with the best of the best,\u201d Chen said. Credit Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press, via Associated Press\n\nLast May, and again in June, Chen visited Nichol in Richmond Hill, Ontario, outside of Toronto. She gave him a Power Point presentation, seeking to expand his understanding of art through dance, painting, sculpture, even gardening, while also trying to demystify the art of skating. They spoke of feeling music, not simply hearing it, of learning to interpret its nuances and of building on his ballet training to tell a story through movement.\n\nNichol also felt that Chen was \u201cusing too much tension in his body\u201d and \u201cmuscling things\u201d with his skating stroke. So she brought in a blade-skills expert, Tracey Robertson-Hanford, to help Chen deepen his edges, enhance his rhythmic knee action and develop what appears to be effortless power and acceleration on the ice. The idea is for the skater to seem as if he is being pulled along by a magnet, conserving energy and performing with a sweeping gracefulness.\n\n\u201cI felt that mastering the blade would liberate Nathan\u2019s body to do all the movement he can do,\u201d Nichol said.\n\nAs Chen became more absorbed by the music, he and Nichol began to choreograph the long program. She showed him ideas; he suggested some of his own and seemed to grow excited about the routine. \u201cI knew we were going to be more than O.K.,\u201d Nichol said.\n\nGoing to the Source\n\nIn late October, Chen competed at the Rostelecom Cup, an Olympic warm-up in Moscow, and defeated Hanyu, the reigning Olympic champion. But he did not skate cleanly in his long program. A couple of weeks later, he called Li in Australia.\n\nImage Chen, far right, with the American squad during the team event at the Olympics on Monday. The United States earned a bronze medal. Credit Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI really needed to understand the character better to perform the character properly,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI needed to do him justice through this program. I couldn\u2019t just butcher it.\u201d\n\nThe two talked for 20 minutes. Amiable and voluble, Li speaks with the rhetorical flourish of a man who has told his story often. He stressed that an artist must embrace failure on the way to success.\n\n\u201cYou have devastating defeat and you learn from that,\u201d Li said he told Chen, \u201cand it is going to make your success that much more rewarding.\u201d\n\nAs Li recounted the conversation, he said he admonished Chen to escape himself and fully inhabit the character when performing, so that \u201cyou will live in the story and the story will carry you through.\u201d\n\nLi told Chen, \u201cWhen you spin in the air, you should feel you are only coming down because you choose to.\u201d\n\nIn three international competitions during the fall, Chen finished first each time but skated unevenly in his long program. Still, at the United States championships last month in San Jose, Calif., a renewed Chen seemed to skate with inexorable determination.\n\nBrian Boitano, the 1988 Olympic champion, was in attendance. He noticed on the jumbo scoreboard that Chen had a glaring focus before the long program. He seemed ready.\n\n\u201cLaser beams through the eyes,\u201d Boitano called it.\n\nChen wore a black costume to suggest flow, a high neck to amplify his height and zippers to insinuate a contemporary interpretation of the \u201cMao\u2019s Last Dancer\u201d soundtrack, which includes Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring.\u201d Again, the costume had no sequins. \u201cI genuinely dislike sequins,\u201d Chen said.\n\nHe portrayed the extreme arc of Li\u2019s life \u2014 isolation, darkness, confusion, brightening, soaring \u2014 but the performance was not flawless. Chen reduced a triple Axel to a single rotation. And his energy lagged during \u201cThe Rite of Spring,\u201d a section of his routine during which Li told him to \u201cpounce like a tiger.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in a year, Chen landed five quad jumps in his free skate. And he received three perfect scores of 10 for performance and musical interpretation.\n\n\u201cI see a difference, even last year to this year,\u201d Boitano said. \u201cI\u2019ve liked his stuff before, but his long program this time, his position, his fluidity, the way he holds himself, is more adult. It\u2019s getting more adult, and it\u2019s getting more precise.\u201d\n\nA jumper was maturing as an artist, just in time for the Olympics.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B 10 of the New York edition with the headline: How Nathan Chen Became an Artist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.
