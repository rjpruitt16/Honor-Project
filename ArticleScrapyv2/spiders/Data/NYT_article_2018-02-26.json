The Olympics, on the other hand, are a grueling three-week marathon of nonstop physical exertion \u2014 for the photographer.\n\nPhoto\n\nI mostly cover alpine skiing, which forces me to be in really good shape. I\u2019m not an expert skier. And when you put 40 pounds of equipment on your back and have to ski down to your photo position, it can be quite dangerous and exhausting. There are also many locations where I have to hike up the mountain to get into position \u2014 again carrying all my equipment \u2014 and then stand in place for two to three hours in temperatures that, here in South Korea, have been in the single digits.\n\nPhoto\n\nI started my Olympic training the day after Christmas by strapping on the same backpack I would carry here, but loaded up with a barbell that weighed 30 pounds or more, and walking hills and steps near my house for up to an hour every day. (On many days my wife walked with me, carrying a backpack with slightly less weight in it.)\n\nVideo\n\nI\u2019m 57 years old, and every Olympics I try to work a little harder to be in better shape than I was for the previous one. On this trip, I\u2019ve averaged 14,000 to 18,000 steps per day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEighty percent of those steps have been taken while wearing a backpack filled with two cameras, at least three lenses, chargers, extra batteries, hand warmers, power bars, ice crampons, sunscreen and usually a bottle of water.\n\nPhoto\n\nOnce in position on the mountain, it\u2019s a waiting game. You try everything to keep warm. I pasted toe warmers onto my smart shirt near my kidneys. (All your blood goes through your kidneys.)

I also like to put two toe warmers in each boot \u2014 one on the top of my toes and one on the bottom.\n\nPhoto\n\nI constantly push myself to shoot as many events as I can.

The figure was a marked decrease from the 4.9 million viewers who watched the same matchup in the 2014 gold medal game at the 2014 Sochi Games, which was broadcast on NBC \u2014 though the 2014 final began at noon Eastern time, while this year\u2019s gold medal game began at 11 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViewership for this year\u2019s Olympic men\u2019s tournament saw a similar decline. The United States men\u2019s eight-round shootout victory over Russia in the 2014 Sochi Games established a record at the time for a hockey game on NBCSN, with 4.1 million viewers. But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number, a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches \u2014 and others \u2014 from tuning in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk.

But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war.

Credit Antonio Bat/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nVictor Mather: Four years ago, Norway had by all accounts a screamingly successful Winter Olympics, but failed to win the events it treasures the most: the cross country relays. Indeed, Norway failed even to win a medal, placing fourth in the men\u2019s race and fifth in the women\u2019s.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.\n\nBut Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.\n\nThen she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)\n\nAnd the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.\n\nFor good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again.\n\nImage Adam Rippon in the men's free skate.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Voice That Soared\n\nKaren Crouse: Mixed zones, those areas where reporters descend on athletes immediately after they\u2019re done competing, are seldom places of high profundity. Imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. But then along came the walking book of quotations known as Adam Rippon, whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.\n\nRippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. After his free skate in the men\u2019s singles, Rippon, one of two openly gay men on the United States Olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don\u2019t embrace him.\n\n\u201cHaters are just fans in denial,\u201d Rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.\n\nImage Xu Mengtao of China during the women's aerials. She did not reach the medal round. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nWhen Olympic Stars Twinkle Overhead\n\nJames Hill: One night during the first week of competition, I had the chance to photograph the women\u2019s aerials finals at Phoenix Snow Park.\n\nIt was my first visit to the venue, and the photo manager told me that during practice he allowed photographers to stand underneath the ramp off which the skiers launch themselves. Normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. This vantage point gave an entirely different view.\n\nOne cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.\n\nAs they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.\n\nImage Jingyu Lee and Yoonjung Park of the unified Korean hockey team took a lap around the ice after their final game of the Olympics.

Yet after the team\u2019s final game, against Sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, \u201cWe are one!\u201d\n\nThen the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 Seoul Games, \u201cHand in Hand,\u201d blared across the arena. The last player on the ice was goalie Shin So-jung, who let in four goals that night. She left to a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nImage Choi Min-jeong of South Korea after winning the 1,500-meter short-track speedskating race.

During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman. She was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.\n\nImage Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany after their stunning long program. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Perfect Comeback\n\nJere Longman: Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany, who were among the favorites in the pairs figure skating competition, fell to fourth after the short program when Massot made a jumping mistake. He seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.\n\nBut they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.\n\nUntil November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games. Massot later confessed to a friend, \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand everything he said.\u201d\n\nImage Ivett Toth during her sizzling, and chilly, tribute to AC/DC. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Biker on Ice, a Skater on the Edge\n\nJuliet Macur: After just a couple beats of the music playing in the Gangneung Ice Arena, I knew Ivett Toth of Hungary wasn\u2019t skating to the same old songs. Nothing from \u201cCarmen\u201d or \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Not one of those go-to figure skating songs that I\u2019d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first Winter Games in 2002.\n\nThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.\n\nHer music had the rafters shaking. It was AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d and Toth was dressed as a biker. She wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of AC/DC\u2019s lead guitarist, Angus Young, on the back. She also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. It was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.\n\nAs the music suggested, Toth rocked it. Half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d a staple of N.F.L. games. The other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. I swear that I could see the judges growing pale.\n\nToth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.\n\nWhen Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201d\n\nImage Joe Ward, left, with Doug Mills, whom he calls one of his \"heroes.\" Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Going to Be a Good Morning\u2019\n\nJoe Ward: Anytime you can start your workday on a chairlift with the Pulitzer Prize-winning White House photographer Doug Mills, you know it\u2019s going to be a good morning. Wind chills of minus-20 and gusts of 60 m.p.h. only make the experience of working alongside one of your journalistic heroes all the more memorable.\n\nDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor. Some days, more than others, you realize you\u2019re lucky to be doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nImage Artur Nogal of Poland falling painfully early in the speedskating sprint. Credit John Sibley/Reuters\n\nAn Athlete Falls, and Applause Rises\n\nDavid Segal: If Poland\u2019s Artur Nogal ever has grandchildren and wants to tell them about his Olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.\n\nIf records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.\n\nImage Family and fans of Anna Gasser of Austria celebrate her win in the women's Big Air snowboarding final. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nA Visual Cue From the Roar of the Crowd\n\nBedel Saget: As a visual journalist, I find it interesting that my favorite moment of the Pyeongchang Games was a strictly audible one. For the women\u2019s big air final, I was shooting from a position where I could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (Ask the silver medalist, Jamie Anderson, who couldn\u2019t hold onto first place after failing to land her \u201ccab double cork 1080\u201d in the final round.)\n\nI followed as best as I could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. By the third and final round, I had a strong feeling that the Austrian Anna Gasser \u2014 the reigning world champion and favorite whom I\u2019d followed for an entire year for one of our Olympic preview interactive graphics \u2014 would land somewhere on the podium.\n\nThe stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.\n\nImage Vice President Mike Pence of the United States and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea shared a laugh at the women's 500 meters short-track speedskating race. Credit Julie Jacobson/Associated Press\n\nA Night of Geopolitics, and Gold\n\nRandal C. Archibold: In one night, I saw South Korea win its first gold medal, Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage push past me, and the North Korean cheerleading squad execute \u201cthe wave\u201d with robotic precision.\n\nWho knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?\n\nIt was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.\n\nImage Who let this guy come to the top of the jump? Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAn Olympic Veteran Reaches New Heights\n\nDoug Mills: Without a doubt, my pinch-me moment came when I was allowed to spend time up in the ski jumpers\u2019 start house. This is a place I had never visited while photographing several other Games, and I had not seen many photos made from inside.\n\nI would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.\n\nImage \"As long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the Norwegian men at the train station. Credit Inyoung Kang\n\nNorwegian Fans Help Make the World Smaller\n\nInyoung Kang: I was waiting for the 8:24 train back to Seoul when I heard the two men coming \u2014 laughing, chattering, clanking. They were covered in Norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their Viking plushies.\n\nI gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.\n\nI snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\n\n\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201d\n\nThe first Olympics I remember watching were the Nagano Games in 1998. As a child, I was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. Now, 20 years later, I was in the country of my parents\u2019 birth to cover my first Olympics. I have always felt a bit like an outsider \u2014 a minority at home or a foreigner with an American accent here. But that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to Korea, the world felt a little smaller. I thanked the Norwegians, and we parted ways.\n\n\n\nImage At the finish of the team sprint, Jessie Diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for Team U.S.A., clinching its first gold in cross country. Credit Dmitri Lovetsky/Associated Press\n\nBecause Minnesota\n\nTalya Minsberg: \u201cBecause Minnesota.\u201d That\u2019s a reason I was assigned to follow the United States women\u2019s cross country team throughout the Winter Games. Both Jessie Diggins and I grew up in Minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the Twin Cities.\n\nDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.\n\nOn Feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. On Feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. Two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just 3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. And when the stands were the fullest, on Feb. 17, the American team of Sophie Caldwell, Sadie Bjornsen, Kikkan Randall and Diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.\n\nWhen asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so many narrow misses, Diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201d\n\nThe race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in Olympic highlight reels for years. Diggins and Randall didn\u2019t just win a medal. They took the gold.\n\n\n\nImage The Pyeongchang crowds approached the Olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nSome of the Best Pictures Are Not of Athletes\n\nHilary Swift: One of my favorite days at the Olympics was the qualifying runs for women\u2019s big air snowboarding. It was probably the warmest day I can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.\n\nMy colleague Doug Mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so I was free to roam the crowd and look for features. To me, this photo speaks to what the Olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. You may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you\u2019re supporting your country\u2019s athletes and others from all over the world.\n\nImage The media buses at the Olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the Games. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nPardon the Delay While My Country Races\n\nAndrew Keh: A bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last Sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.\n\nRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.\n\nBus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\n\nTwo days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the South Korean women\u2019s curling win over the United States team. Some passengers clapped as the women, unexpected stars of the Games, celebrated on screen. The driver laughed out loud.\n\n\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.\n\nImage Michelle Gisin of Switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the Alpine combined a few days later. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nExceptional on the Slopes, Normal on the Bus\n\nTara Parker-Pope: For me, the best part of the Olympics happened between competitions, when I would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. I struck up a conversation with the Swiss skier Michelle Gisin on a bus \u2014 about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister Dominique won a gold medal in Sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.\n\nGisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing exceptional things.\n\nImage Two old friends, Matthew Futterman, left, and Jason Albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day. Credit Gabby Naranja\n\nIs That You, Jason?\n\nMatthew Futterman: The Olympic Games are supposed to be about bringing people together.\n\nAs a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?\n\nWe spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating problems large and small \u2014 Iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.\n\nOn graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nThe day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.\n\nIn that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.\n\nImage From left to right, Mina Kim, Robert Fissel and the brothers Keun Hwan and Dong-hyung Lee taking in a bobsled race. \"It's so fast,\" Dong-hyung Lee said. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nThe Best Bobsled Picture Has No Bobsled\n\nChang W. Lee: This is my favorite picture from these Olympics.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.\n\nOne day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures.\n\nI kept walking down. Still, nothing much. The competition went on, and I didn\u2019t have a picture yet. I heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. When I had nearly reached the bottom, I saw a gap in the course. I peeked into it. I tried looking for several different groups of fans, but I didn\u2019t see much in the way of reactions.\n\nThen, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.\n\nThree fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.\n\nImage Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic stood stunned after winning the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDid I Really Just Do That?\n\nBill Pennington: The outcome of the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. Or so it seemed. The top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time had already been recorded.\n\nThen Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. When she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. There was a No. 1 next to her name.\n\nOther racers and the audience were as stunned as Ledecka. But not three Czech fans in the grandstand. They began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.\n\nLedecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.\n\nBut there was no error, and bit by bit, the three Czech fans had a contagious effect on those around them. The cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. It almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth \u2014 and celebrated the capricious spirit of the Olympics.\n\nSign up for the Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox ever week.

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.\n\nNew York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here\u2019s a look at some of their favorites photos.\n\nImage Jamie Anderson of the United States won silver in snowboard big air on Thursday morning. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It\u2019s called big air for a reason.\n\nJamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.\n\nImage Shaun White competing at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail \u2014 sometimes over 20 feet above the rim \u2014 to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.\n\nAmerican Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nImage Cassie Sharpe of Canada won the gold in ski halfpipe. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don\u2019t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.\n\nCanada\u2019s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.\n\nImage Yuzuru Hanyu during his free skate. In this program, he scored second behind Nathan Chen of the United States. He scored a 317.85 in total, and was able to defend his Olympic title. Credit Margaret Cheatham Williams/The New York Times\n\nFor a figure skater to earn a spot on the podium, they need to rise above the ice. Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.\n\nJapanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women\u2019s skating competition at the Pyeongchang Games.

Vonn finished 6th. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nNo one can compete with the airborne speed of downhill skiers at the Olympics. To reach the bottom of the hill first, they must navigate jumps quickly and smoothly. That means being airborne at some 80 miles per hour and landing safely, only to make a turn and do it again.\n\nMarc Stein's Newsletter Marc Stein has covered Jordan. He's covered Kobe.

Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet.\n\nPhoto\n\nK-Pop Takes a Turn\n\nTime for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song \u201cThe Baddest Female\u201d and \u201cI Am the Best,\u201d with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas!\n\nPhoto\n\nVisual Spectacle and Some Math\n\nNext a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: \u201cWhen the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.\u201d And \u201cThe Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.\u201d Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.\n\nPhoto\n\nCross-Country Medalists Share the Stage\n\nTraditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is \u201cescrime.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea Carry Their Own Flags\n\nRather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea.\n\nOn the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Parade of Flags, Minus One\n\nNext up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games.\n\nThe Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon\u2019s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA Blending of Traditional and Rock Music\n\nJang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment.

And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi\u2019s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock \u2014 the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Colorful Introduction and a Handshake\n\nIn a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games.\n\nIt was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

That group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe Bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late Saturday. The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nTwo investigations revealed that Russia\u2019s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years. Many of Russia\u2019s top athletes were linked to the scandal and barred from the Games.\n\nAlina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, was the only Russian to have won a gold medal in Pyeongchang by the time the committee voted. The men\u2019s hockey team won a second gold on Sunday, defeating Germany.\n\nThe Russians will now leave the Olympics the way they entered: in neutral uniforms that provided a constant reminder of the damage done to Russia\u2019s sporting reputation by the scheme, a state-controlled effort to replace drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones, according to the investigations.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two Games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. Before the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where Russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. It made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these Winter Olympics.

She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country\u2019s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. Russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision everyone will be happy with,\u201d Hoevertsz said after Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cWe will be criticized.\u201d\n\nThe decision to potentially reinstate Russia met skepticism on Sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.\u2019s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012)\n\n\u201cIf the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,\u201d Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating.\n\nRichard Pound, the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia.

It seems to have worked. Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together. She recalled sharing a moment with Bjorgen when they were each presented a stuffed white Soohorang tiger, the Olympic mascot, during the podium ceremony.

In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined.

As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth.\n\nIn a thrilling end to a battle between the sport\u2019s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women\u2019s ice hockey .

People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["olympic", "york", "luge", "winter", "bobsled", "states", "started", "sport", "skating", "athletes", "united", "credit"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

It debuted on the World Cup circuit during the 2011-12 season. Other events in long-track speedskating are pure time trials, wherein athletes, in pairs, race the clock and know where they\u2019ve finished only after everyone has finished skating.\n\nMass start puts up to 28 skaters on the ice at the same time to race 16 laps around the 400-meter oval. Competitors are not restricted to their lanes, as in other long-track events. Skaters therefore have to think about much more than pure speed. They make tactical decisions about whether to stick with the pack or make a breakaway move. They draft one another and try to read their intentions.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome say it resembles short-track speedskating on a long-track oval. Some say it feels more like a running or cycling race. Mantia said mass start was something casual spectators might enjoy more than the other long-track events, which unfold in stop-and-start increments and often can be anticlimactic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing long-track for about six years now, and I love the sport, but it\u2019s a little tough to watch sometimes,\u201d Mantia said in an interview before the Games.\n\nBut mass-start races are different, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s 16 laps, but it keeps you engaged the whole time. There\u2019s always something going on, and you know as soon as the race finishes, first is gold, second is silver and third is bronze. It\u2019s simple.

He said he had made progress in those areas with the help of sports psychologists.\n\nBut mass start, he said, has always been a refuge.\n\n\u201cOnce I started doing mass starts, I was like, O.K., that all goes out the window,\u201d Mantia said before the Olympics. \u201cEven if everything else goes completely terrible, and falls short of all expectations, I still race and win in mass start.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always kind of the ace up my sleeve,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nTeammates said Mantia\u2019s background in in-line skating in Florida, before switching to ice, instilled in him the proper instincts to navigate the more hectic and unpredictable mass-start competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvery race in in-lines, or almost every race, is a mass start,\u201d said Mitchell Whitmore, who finished 10th in the 1,000 on Friday. \u201cSo it\u2019s just second nature to him, strategy-wise.\u201d\n\nAmerican long-track speedskaters won numerous medals combined at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Games before being shut out at the Olympics four years ago in Sochi, Russia.

NBC\u2019s prime-time ratings are down, too, about 16 percent from four years ago, though according to Total Audience Delivery, NBC\u2019s preferred measuring stick and the one it used to sell ads for the Games, viewership is only down 8 percent over all.\n\nBut another barometer could be telling, too, of the Olympics\u2019 popularity: Most of the viral hits online from the Games, according to data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, have little to do with athletic achievement. These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.\n\nOf the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman \u201cpracticing\u201d the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d which premiered during the Games.\n\nWhile the Roomba curler did indeed \u201churry hard,\u201d here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.\n\nImage Chloe Kim of the United States during her halfpipe gold medal run.

White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.\n\nBut the discussion this time was not all about White\u2019s athletic achievements.

The figure was a marked decrease from the 4.9 million viewers who watched the same matchup in the 2014 gold medal game at the 2014 Sochi Games, which was broadcast on NBC \u2014 though the 2014 final began at noon Eastern time, while this year\u2019s gold medal game began at 11 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nViewership for this year\u2019s Olympic men\u2019s tournament saw a similar decline.

But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number, a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches \u2014 and others \u2014 from tuning in.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk.

But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S.

Credit Antonio Bat/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nVictor Mather: Four years ago, Norway had by all accounts a screamingly successful Winter Olympics, but failed to win the events it treasures the most: the cross country relays. Indeed, Norway failed even to win a medal, placing fourth in the men\u2019s race and fifth in the women\u2019s.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.\n\nBut Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.\n\nThen she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)\n\nAnd the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.\n\nFor good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again.\n\nImage Adam Rippon in the men's free skate.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Voice That Soared\n\nKaren Crouse: Mixed zones, those areas where reporters descend on athletes immediately after they\u2019re done competing, are seldom places of high profundity. Imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. But then along came the walking book of quotations known as Adam Rippon, whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.\n\nRippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. After his free skate in the men\u2019s singles, Rippon, one of two openly gay men on the United States Olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don\u2019t embrace him.\n\n\u201cHaters are just fans in denial,\u201d Rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.\n\nImage Xu Mengtao of China during the women's aerials. She did not reach the medal round. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nWhen Olympic Stars Twinkle Overhead\n\nJames Hill: One night during the first week of competition, I had the chance to photograph the women\u2019s aerials finals at Phoenix Snow Park.\n\nIt was my first visit to the venue, and the photo manager told me that during practice he allowed photographers to stand underneath the ramp off which the skiers launch themselves. Normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. This vantage point gave an entirely different view.\n\nOne cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.\n\nAs they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.\n\nImage Jingyu Lee and Yoonjung Park of the unified Korean hockey team took a lap around the ice after their final game of the Olympics.

Yet after the team\u2019s final game, against Sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, \u201cWe are one!\u201d\n\nThen the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 Seoul Games, \u201cHand in Hand,\u201d blared across the arena. The last player on the ice was goalie Shin So-jung, who let in four goals that night. She left to a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nImage Choi Min-jeong of South Korea after winning the 1,500-meter short-track speedskating race.

During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman. She was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.\n\nImage Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany after their stunning long program. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Perfect Comeback\n\nJere Longman: Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany, who were among the favorites in the pairs figure skating competition, fell to fourth after the short program when Massot made a jumping mistake. He seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.\n\nBut they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.\n\nUntil November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games. Massot later confessed to a friend, \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand everything he said.\u201d\n\nImage Ivett Toth during her sizzling, and chilly, tribute to AC/DC. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Biker on Ice, a Skater on the Edge\n\nJuliet Macur: After just a couple beats of the music playing in the Gangneung Ice Arena, I knew Ivett Toth of Hungary wasn\u2019t skating to the same old songs. Nothing from \u201cCarmen\u201d or \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Not one of those go-to figure skating songs that I\u2019d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first Winter Games in 2002.\n\nThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.\n\nHer music had the rafters shaking. It was AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d and Toth was dressed as a biker. She wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of AC/DC\u2019s lead guitarist, Angus Young, on the back. She also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. It was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.\n\nAs the music suggested, Toth rocked it. Half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d a staple of N.F.L. games. The other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. I swear that I could see the judges growing pale.\n\nToth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.\n\nWhen Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201d\n\nImage Joe Ward, left, with Doug Mills, whom he calls one of his \"heroes.\" Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Going to Be a Good Morning\u2019\n\nJoe Ward: Anytime you can start your workday on a chairlift with the Pulitzer Prize-winning White House photographer Doug Mills, you know it\u2019s going to be a good morning. Wind chills of minus-20 and gusts of 60 m.p.h. only make the experience of working alongside one of your journalistic heroes all the more memorable.\n\nDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor.

Credit John Sibley/Reuters\n\nAn Athlete Falls, and Applause Rises\n\nDavid Segal: If Poland\u2019s Artur Nogal ever has grandchildren and wants to tell them about his Olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.\n\nIf records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.\n\nImage Family and fans of Anna Gasser of Austria celebrate her win in the women's Big Air snowboarding final. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nA Visual Cue From the Roar of the Crowd\n\nBedel Saget: As a visual journalist, I find it interesting that my favorite moment of the Pyeongchang Games was a strictly audible one. For the women\u2019s big air final, I was shooting from a position where I could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (Ask the silver medalist, Jamie Anderson, who couldn\u2019t hold onto first place after failing to land her \u201ccab double cork 1080\u201d in the final round.)\n\nI followed as best as I could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. By the third and final round, I had a strong feeling that the Austrian Anna Gasser \u2014 the reigning world champion and favorite whom I\u2019d followed for an entire year for one of our Olympic preview interactive graphics \u2014 would land somewhere on the podium.\n\nThe stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.\n\nImage Vice President Mike Pence of the United States and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea shared a laugh at the women's 500 meters short-track speedskating race. Credit Julie Jacobson/Associated Press\n\nA Night of Geopolitics, and Gold\n\nRandal C. Archibold: In one night, I saw South Korea win its first gold medal, Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage push past me, and the North Korean cheerleading squad execute \u201cthe wave\u201d with robotic precision.\n\nWho knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?\n\nIt was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.\n\nImage Who let this guy come to the top of the jump? Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAn Olympic Veteran Reaches New Heights\n\nDoug Mills: Without a doubt, my pinch-me moment came when I was allowed to spend time up in the ski jumpers\u2019 start house. This is a place I had never visited while photographing several other Games, and I had not seen many photos made from inside.\n\nI would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.\n\nImage \"As long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the Norwegian men at the train station. Credit Inyoung Kang\n\nNorwegian Fans Help Make the World Smaller\n\nInyoung Kang: I was waiting for the 8:24 train back to Seoul when I heard the two men coming \u2014 laughing, chattering, clanking. They were covered in Norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their Viking plushies.\n\nI gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.\n\nI snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\n\n\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201d\n\nThe first Olympics I remember watching were the Nagano Games in 1998. As a child, I was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. Now, 20 years later, I was in the country of my parents\u2019 birth to cover my first Olympics. I have always felt a bit like an outsider \u2014 a minority at home or a foreigner with an American accent here. But that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to Korea, the world felt a little smaller. I thanked the Norwegians, and we parted ways.\n\n\n\nImage At the finish of the team sprint, Jessie Diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for Team U.S.A., clinching its first gold in cross country.

Both Jessie Diggins and I grew up in Minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the Twin Cities.\n\nDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.\n\nOn Feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. On Feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. Two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just 3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. And when the stands were the fullest, on Feb. 17, the American team of Sophie Caldwell, Sadie Bjornsen, Kikkan Randall and Diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.\n\nWhen asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so many narrow misses, Diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201d\n\nThe race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in Olympic highlight reels for years. Diggins and Randall didn\u2019t just win a medal. They took the gold.\n\n\n\nImage The Pyeongchang crowds approached the Olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nSome of the Best Pictures Are Not of Athletes\n\nHilary Swift: One of my favorite days at the Olympics was the qualifying runs for women\u2019s big air snowboarding. It was probably the warmest day I can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.\n\nMy colleague Doug Mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so I was free to roam the crowd and look for features. To me, this photo speaks to what the Olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. You may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you\u2019re supporting your country\u2019s athletes and others from all over the world.\n\nImage The media buses at the Olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the Games. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nPardon the Delay While My Country Races\n\nAndrew Keh: A bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last Sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.\n\nRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.\n\nBus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\n\nTwo days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the South Korean women\u2019s curling win over the United States team. Some passengers clapped as the women, unexpected stars of the Games, celebrated on screen. The driver laughed out loud.\n\n\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.\n\nImage Michelle Gisin of Switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the Alpine combined a few days later. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nExceptional on the Slopes, Normal on the Bus\n\nTara Parker-Pope: For me, the best part of the Olympics happened between competitions, when I would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. I struck up a conversation with the Swiss skier Michelle Gisin on a bus \u2014 about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister Dominique won a gold medal in Sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.\n\nGisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing exceptional things.\n\nImage Two old friends, Matthew Futterman, left, and Jason Albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day. Credit Gabby Naranja\n\nIs That You, Jason?\n\nMatthew Futterman: The Olympic Games are supposed to be about bringing people together.\n\nAs a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?\n\nWe spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating problems large and small \u2014 Iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.\n\nOn graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nThe day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.\n\nIn that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.\n\nImage From left to right, Mina Kim, Robert Fissel and the brothers Keun Hwan and Dong-hyung Lee taking in a bobsled race. \"It's so fast,\" Dong-hyung Lee said. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nThe Best Bobsled Picture Has No Bobsled\n\nChang W. Lee: This is my favorite picture from these Olympics.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.\n\nOne day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures.\n\nI kept walking down. Still, nothing much. The competition went on, and I didn\u2019t have a picture yet. I heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. When I had nearly reached the bottom, I saw a gap in the course. I peeked into it. I tried looking for several different groups of fans, but I didn\u2019t see much in the way of reactions.\n\nThen, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.\n\nThree fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.\n\nImage Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic stood stunned after winning the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDid I Really Just Do That?\n\nBill Pennington: The outcome of the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. Or so it seemed. The top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time had already been recorded.\n\nThen Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. When she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. There was a No. 1 next to her name.\n\nOther racers and the audience were as stunned as Ledecka. But not three Czech fans in the grandstand. They began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.\n\nLedecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.\n\nBut there was no error, and bit by bit, the three Czech fans had a contagious effect on those around them. The cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. It almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth \u2014 and celebrated the capricious spirit of the Olympics.\n\nSign up for the Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox ever week.

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.\n\nNew York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here\u2019s a look at some of their favorites photos.\n\nImage Jamie Anderson of the United States won silver in snowboard big air on Thursday morning. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It\u2019s called big air for a reason.\n\nJamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.\n\nImage Shaun White competing at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail \u2014 sometimes over 20 feet above the rim \u2014 to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.\n\nAmerican Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nImage Cassie Sharpe of Canada won the gold in ski halfpipe. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don\u2019t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.\n\nCanada\u2019s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.\n\nImage Yuzuru Hanyu during his free skate. In this program, he scored second behind Nathan Chen of the United States. He scored a 317.85 in total, and was able to defend his Olympic title. Credit Margaret Cheatham Williams/The New York Times\n\nFor a figure skater to earn a spot on the podium, they need to rise above the ice. Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.\n\nJapanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women\u2019s skating competition at the Pyeongchang Games. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nRussian gold medalist Alina Zagitova successfully landed a triple lutz \u2014 triple loop combination in both her short and long program.\n\nImage Lindsey Vonn of the United States hits a jump during her run at the Jeongseon Alpine Center in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Vonn finished 6th. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nNo one can compete with the airborne speed of downhill skiers at the Olympics. To reach the bottom of the hill first, they must navigate jumps quickly and smoothly. That means being airborne at some 80 miles per hour and landing safely, only to make a turn and do it again.\n\nMarc Stein's Newsletter Marc Stein has covered Jordan. He's covered Kobe.

Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet.\n\nPhoto\n\nK-Pop Takes a Turn\n\nTime for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song \u201cThe Baddest Female\u201d and \u201cI Am the Best,\u201d with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas!\n\nPhoto\n\nVisual Spectacle and Some Math\n\nNext a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: \u201cWhen the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.\u201d And \u201cThe Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.\u201d Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.\n\nPhoto\n\nCross-Country Medalists Share the Stage\n\nTraditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is \u201cescrime.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea Carry Their Own Flags\n\nRather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea.\n\nOn the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Parade of Flags, Minus One\n\nNext up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games.\n\nThe Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon\u2019s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA Blending of Traditional and Rock Music\n\nJang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment. The anthem was accompanied not by an orchestra but by a single marimba, a xylophone-like instrument. And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi\u2019s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock \u2014 the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Colorful Introduction and a Handshake\n\nIn a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games.\n\nIt was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

That group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe Bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late Saturday. The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nTwo investigations revealed that Russia\u2019s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years. Many of Russia\u2019s top athletes were linked to the scandal and barred from the Games.\n\nAlina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, was the only Russian to have won a gold medal in Pyeongchang by the time the committee voted. The men\u2019s hockey team won a second gold on Sunday, defeating Germany.\n\nThe Russians will now leave the Olympics the way they entered: in neutral uniforms that provided a constant reminder of the damage done to Russia\u2019s sporting reputation by the scheme, a state-controlled effort to replace drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones, according to the investigations.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two Games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. Before the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where Russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants.

She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country\u2019s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. Russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision everyone will be happy with,\u201d Hoevertsz said after Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cWe will be criticized.\u201d\n\nThe decision to potentially reinstate Russia met skepticism on Sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.\u2019s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012)\n\n\u201cIf the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,\u201d Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating.\n\nRichard Pound, the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia. Adam Pengilly, a British member who also has been critical of the I.O.C.\u2019s reaction to the Russia scandal, was sent home from the Games after an altercation with a security guard.\n\nAfter being warned that their conduct would affect the I.O.C.\u2019s decision, Russian athletes have largely been keeping a low profile in South Korea. They have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols.\n\nThe two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said.

It seems to have worked. Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together. She recalled sharing a moment with Bjorgen when they were each presented a stuffed white Soohorang tiger, the Olympic mascot, during the podium ceremony. They looked at each other with a knowing laugh.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, this is for Breck,\u2019 and she said, \u2018This is for Marius.\u2019 \u201d", "keywords": ["randall", "ski", "olympic", "wanted", "olympics", "international", "skis", "gold", "team", "breck", "baby", "motherhood", "federation", "family", "away", "bronze"], "polarity": 0.11003659039373326, "subjectivity": 0.35858757644471934},

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 Eight years ago at the Vancouver Winter Olympics, four racers on the United States ski team combined to win eight medals in the 10 Alpine events, including two golds. The American medal haul, led by Bode Miller, was twice the amount of any other nation.\n\nAt the time, the team\u2019s rallying cry was \u201cBest in the World.\u201d The European ski racing establishment occasionally mocked that mission statement. But not in 2010. The Americans were a force.\n\nFour years later at the Sochi Games, five Alpine athletes from the United States team \u2014 three men and two women \u2014 won five medals. There were two American Olympic champions.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Olympics, American skiers combined to win a gold, a silver and a bronze, and all of it stemmed from the efforts of only two racers. Mikaela Shiffrin won the women\u2019s giant slalom and was second in the Alpine combined. Lindsey Vonn claimed a bronze in the downhill.\n\nVonn, 33, now expects to retire from the sport after the next World Cup season. Asked to look ahead to the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the oft-injured Vonn smiled on Thursday and said, \u201cMy body can\u2019t take four more years.\u201d\n\nThat leaves the 22-year-old Shiffrin, who could compete in two or three more Winter Olympics. Shiffrin may yet be a transcendent talent who sets a host of Olympic medal records, but is anyone else in the American ski racing community going to rise up and give her a hand?\n\nIn the last two weeks here, besides Vonn and Shiffrin, there were women on the United States team who showed promise. In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nImage Ted Ligety in the slalom portion of the men\u2019s Alpine combined. His fifth place in the event was the highest finish by an American man in the Alpine events at the Pyeongchang Games. Credit Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak. Perhaps symbolically, Ted Ligety, one of three Americans to win two Alpine gold medals, watched his Olympic career probably come to a close with a disappointing 15th in his signature event, the giant slalom. Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here. That\u2019s a long way from the eight medals the Olympic men\u2019s team won at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all cylinders firing, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t turn it around in a two- to four-year cycle,\u201d said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, the umbrella group overseeing the ski team. \u201cWe have a lot of young talent. I think you need to look at potential, and when I look at the potential, I\u2019m not worried.\u201d\n\nIt is true that there were flashes of an improved future for the American men. Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined. Bennett and Cochran-Siegle are each 25 years old.\n\nBuried for now deep on the United States ski team\u2019s roster are other American men with impressive junior racing pedigrees who were simply too untested on the World Cup level to qualify for the trip to Pyeongchang. Included in that group is River Radamus, the son of two high-level, Colorado-based, ski racing coaches. Radamus, 19, has been near the top of the overall standings on what amounts to ski racing\u2019s minor league circuit for most of this winter. In 2017, at the Youth Olympic Games, Radamus won three races, which was unprecedented at the event.\n\nTwo years older than Radamus is his teammate Sam Morse, who won the downhill at the junior world championships last year (Merryweather won the women\u2019s downhill).\n\nMorse, raised in Maine, not only believes better days are coming for the American men, he believes the new wave of racers will introduce pioneering techniques because it is the first generation to have spent its entire upbringing using shaped skis, which, because of their parabolic silhouettes, are easier to turn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different style coming up, more arcing of turns and less sliding,\u201d Morse said late last year.\n\nMorse added: \u201cAnd when we come up, it won\u2019t just be one or two fast guys but a whole squad.\u201d\n\nIf so, Shiffrin will appreciate the reinforcements.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SP 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Right Now, Shiffrin Is Alone at the Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for the Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox ever week.

Mr. Lee said that the pair jumped into the car and drove from Daegwalryong village in Pyeongchang to the athletes\u2019 village, in Gangneung.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the athlete or the manager drove the car.

A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Missed\n\nKjeld Nuis of the Netherlands, the 1,500-meter winner, edged Havard Lorentzen of Norway, the 500-meter winner, in the men\u2019s 1,000-meter speedskating race. It was the seventh gold medal for the Netherlands out of 12 events so far.\n\nThe old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men\u2019s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first. Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth.\n\nIn a thrilling end to a battle between the sport\u2019s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women\u2019s ice hockey . Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson\u2019s goal in the sixth round of the shootout sealed the victory for the Americans, giving the team its first gold in the event since 1998.\n\nAlina Zagitova of Russia won the Olympic gold medal in women\u2019s figure skating, edging out her countrywoman, Evgenia Medvedeva. The two skaters tied in the free skate, but Zagitova\u2019s small edge in the short program made the difference.\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next\n\nThe closing ceremony\n\nVictor Mather is a general assignment sports reporter and editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for the Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox ever week.

Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang.

Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["olympic", "york", "luge", "winter", "bobsled", "states", "started", "sport", "skating", "athletes", "united", "credit"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

It debuted on the World Cup circuit during the 2011-12 season. Other events in long-track speedskating are pure time trials, wherein athletes, in pairs, race the clock and know where they\u2019ve finished only after everyone has finished skating.\n\nMass start puts up to 28 skaters on the ice at the same time to race 16 laps around the 400-meter oval. Competitors are not restricted to their lanes, as in other long-track events. Skaters therefore have to think about much more than pure speed. They make tactical decisions about whether to stick with the pack or make a breakaway move. They draft one another and try to read their intentions.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome say it resembles short-track speedskating on a long-track oval. Some say it feels more like a running or cycling race. Mantia said mass start was something casual spectators might enjoy more than the other long-track events, which unfold in stop-and-start increments and often can be anticlimactic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing long-track for about six years now, and I love the sport, but it\u2019s a little tough to watch sometimes,\u201d Mantia said in an interview before the Games.\n\nBut mass-start races are different, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s 16 laps, but it keeps you engaged the whole time. There\u2019s always something going on, and you know as soon as the race finishes, first is gold, second is silver and third is bronze. It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s relatable.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

He said he had made progress in those areas with the help of sports psychologists.\n\nBut mass start, he said, has always been a refuge.\n\n\u201cOnce I started doing mass starts, I was like, O.K., that all goes out the window,\u201d Mantia said before the Olympics. \u201cEven if everything else goes completely terrible, and falls short of all expectations, I still race and win in mass start.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always kind of the ace up my sleeve,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nTeammates said Mantia\u2019s background in in-line skating in Florida, before switching to ice, instilled in him the proper instincts to navigate the more hectic and unpredictable mass-start competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvery race in in-lines, or almost every race, is a mass start,\u201d said Mitchell Whitmore, who finished 10th in the 1,000 on Friday. \u201cSo it\u2019s just second nature to him, strategy-wise.\u201d\n\nAmerican long-track speedskaters won numerous medals combined at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Games before being shut out at the Olympics four years ago in Sochi, Russia.

NBC\u2019s prime-time ratings are down, too, about 16 percent from four years ago, though according to Total Audience Delivery, NBC\u2019s preferred measuring stick and the one it used to sell ads for the Games, viewership is only down 8 percent over all.\n\nBut another barometer could be telling, too, of the Olympics\u2019 popularity: Most of the viral hits online from the Games, according to data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, have little to do with athletic achievement. These heavily circulated snapshots have focused instead more on the quirky personalities, underdog efforts and curious moments that have always been a part of the Olympics but now spread to a wider audience.\n\nOf the accounts that CrowdTangle tracks, some of the top Facebook posts (those that see lots of likes, comments, shares and clicks) from Feb. 9 to 21 included memes (a spoof of figure skating routines), a look at the synchronized drones from the opening ceremony, a video of a woman \u201cpracticing\u201d the sport of curling with a Roomba and two trailers for \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d which premiered during the Games.\n\nWhile the Roomba curler did indeed \u201churry hard,\u201d here are the other Olympians who managed to get a lot of attention, but perhaps not always in the way they intended.\n\nImage Chloe Kim of the United States during her halfpipe gold medal run.

From Feb. 9 to 21, White was the most talked about athlete on Facebook, according to the company. (Facebook will release more complete data after the conclusion of the Games.) White was also the most mentioned athlete on Facebook during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, even though he failed to win a medal.\n\nBut the discussion this time was not all about White\u2019s athletic achievements. On the heels of his gold medal performance, he was asked about past sexual harassment allegations.

Buck, the first American woman to win the award, whose 1930s novels about Chinese peasant life now read as twee and patronizing Orientalist fairy tales.\n\nNot all works of art age as well as others. Some remain consistent sources of wonder and awe and provocation for century upon century; others, removed from their context, curdle into irrelevance, if not offensiveness. The artist\u2019s difficult job is to create something that addresses the concerns of her time while also contending with the timeless: the needs and desires and frustrations that are particular not to a certain age, but to human existence. The stuff that endures is the work that does both, that manages to reflect a moment while also transcending it. But the vast majority of art is subject to the ebb and flow of cultural tides. Sometimes it\u2019s buried beneath the wave, and sometimes \u2014 when circumstances change \u2014 it\u2019s tossed up again to the surface, a reminder of lost treasure glinting on the water\u2019s crest.\n\nThe subject of our cover story, \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d is a good example of how a piece of art born from a specific moment can find itself newly resonant in an entirely different one. When Mart Crowley\u2019s play opened Off Broadway in 1968, it was an instant and surprise hit, a by turns vicious, lacerating, bitingly funny and squirm-inducing portrait of eight (maybe nine) gay men at a disastrous birthday party in New York. This May, it will have its Broadway debut, with a cast composed entirely of out gay actors, produced and directed by out gay men. The fact that there are now enough openly gay, well-known working actors to populate a Broadway ensemble play \u2014 and, indeed, to be considered draws \u2014 is remarkable: both because many of us remember when this would never have been possible ... but also because many of us can\u2019t imagine it would ever be anything but possible.\n\nIn the intervening five decades between the play\u2019s premiere and its latest revival \u2014 50 years that have seen the Stonewall riots, the official de-pathologization of homosexuality (which was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders only in 1973), AIDS and same-sex marriage \u2014 Crowley\u2019s work has been assessed and reassessed, revived and dismissed, beloved and reviled. But it has always, as The Times\u2019s co-chief theater critic Jesse Green notes in his lovely, searching essay, been relevant, a work of art that every gay playwright since its debut has had to be in conversation with in one way or another. \u201cBoys\u201d was, Green writes, \u201cvery much a ghetto play, a peephole aimed at gay men.\u201d The titular boys were to be witnessed and gawked at; Crowley sought to humanize them, but humanization came through objectification and minimization. (They were boys, after all, not men.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf all the significant changes of the past half-century, one of the greatest must surely be the increasing and hard-won recognition that gay lives are, first, lives. The struggle for civil rights in this country is the struggle to be granted full humanity, to be secure in the basic dignities \u2014 the right to vote, to own property, to marry, to be educated, to be protected by due process \u2014 that every citizen is entitled to and deserves. It is why this play, a chronicle of men living in an era in which those rights were elusive, has such meaning today. Yes, some of the references might be dated (not to mention the costumes: one turtleneck is one too many), but its exploration of the human toll of being denied full personhood is not.\n\nProgress is never straightforward, a projectile fired into space and left to sail upward in a clean trajectory; it halts and recedes and sputters, and requires constant vigilance. (As Green reminds us, it wasn\u2019t so long ago that The Times\u2019s review of \u201cBoys\u201d \u201cthought nothing of flinging phrases like \u2018screamingly fag\u2019 and \u2018fairy queens shouting bitchicisms.\u2019 \u201d) \u201cBoys\u201d is, often, wildly entertaining.

So it can hardly be ignored that the play\u2019s 50th-anniversary revival, opening this spring on Broadway, is addressing a radically different culture, one that \u2014 on the surface, at least \u2014 seems to have sacrificed this undeniably queen-y play on its march toward equality.\n\nAs the actor Zachary Quinto told The New York Times\u2019s co-chief theater critic Jesse Green in an interview for his essay, he originally had \u201ca dismissive take\u201d on \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d having never seen it. But after reading the script and speaking with the producers, he eventually agreed to the part of Harold, the sharp-tongued gay man whose birthday provides the play with its setting. \u201cThe criticism was that it offered a stereotypical quality to who these characters are,\u201d Quinto said. \u201cBut what gets lost is that characters like these had never been seen on the American stage before.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nT\u2019s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara, saw an early reading of the play last summer and \u201cwas struck by how crackling and relevant this 50-year-old play still was: its humor, but also how vividly it telegraphed the characters\u2019 shame and despair,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what made it poignant was seeing, before me, nine openly gay actors who had made successful careers for themselves as themselves.

Credit Brendan Stumpf\n\nThe return of Mart Crowley\u2019s \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d after half a century has had me thinking about the very 20th-century dream of gay liberation, born around the time of that first production in 1968. The idea was that when we were \u201cdone,\u201d we could simply disappear \u2014 into the larger public. We would become ordinary queer people and we would feel unbothered by this apparent contradiction in terms.\n\nWe even imagined that one day, perhaps, there might be no need for a word for us. Today, of course, there are many words, a whole forest of words, and descriptors of sexual identity are increasingly paired with those for gender identity \u2014 gender being among the first ways you relate to yourself. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a word for it,\u201d James Baldwin said of his sexuality as a young boy growing up in Harlem in the 1930s, but now he just might \u2014 he might even have four or five.\n\nDanez Smith, 28, who curated the below selection of poems read by the cast and director of \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d in this video series, and who goes by the pronoun \u201cthey,\u201d is a good example of how we talk about ourselves now: They are black, queer, poz, a poet, a performer. \u201cWhen I was figuring myself out, both as a writer and a queer person, I had examples of how to do it boldly and bravely \u2014 Assotto Saint, Essex Hemphill, Carl Phillips, Mark Doty, Jericho Brown \u2014 and there was never a push toward ambiguity,\u201d Smith says. \u201cInstead, it was a push toward a queer poetics, and a queer poetics of color.\u201d\n\nSmith, whose 2017 collection, \u201cDon\u2019t Call Us Dead,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist, is a risen star in a fast-expanding galaxy of talented queer poets: Saeed Jones, Ocean Vuong, Alex Dimitrov, Hieu Minh Nguyen, Marcelo Hernandez Castillo, Max McDonough, Richie Hofmann, Julian Randall, Keenan Teddy Smith, Jameson Fitzpatrick. This band, boys or not, is making the most of our expanded vocabulary, playing with language to make work that speaks \u2014 profoundly and unapologetically \u2014 to who they are, where they come from and where they are going. As Danez Smith says of the iconic 1987 ACT UP slogan, \u201c\u2018Silence=Death\u2019 showed us that our freedom was in our visibility.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s queer poets, of the moment in every way, have taken the lesson of visibility a step further, cultivating digital identities (see Dimitrov\u2019s Astro Poets project with Dorothea Lasky) to bypass traditional gatekeepers; a photo of a poem published (or not) in a small journal can reach many thousands more readers when posted on Instagram or Tumblr. This also liberates poetry from its expected contexts: Take, for example, AM2DM, the BuzzFeed News morning show on Twitter co-hosted by Saeed Jones, which recently featured the poet Morgan Parker reading her work. These poets are reaching through difference, instead of across it, to make prismatic moments of connection.\n\n\u201cThe world is just queerer now,\u201d Smith says of this golden age of queer poetry. But the world is also strained in a way that has made people eager to celebrate queer art. Reading through Smith\u2019s selections, 10 of which appear below, I keep returning to this line from Jones\u2019s \u201cBoy in Stolen Evening Gown\u201d \u2014 Sir who is no one, sir who is yet to come, I need you \u2014 and a vision of these poets arriving, as if answering a call, fills my mind.

The Party\n\nONE EVENING NOT long after \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d had its Off Broadway premiere in April 1968, Laurence Luckinbill, who played Hank, brought his tool kit to work. Theater Four, as the joint was called, was a dowdy old converted church in a part of Manhattan that the play\u2019s author, Mart Crowley, called a \u201csenseless-killing neighborhood.\u201d But Luckinbill wasn\u2019t lugging tools to make repairs. Instead, he drilled a hole in a piece of the set called a tormentor flat, about waist-high, so that he and his eight castmates, standing backstage, could get a glimpse of whoever was sitting sixth row center: the best seats in the house. Over the coming weeks the actors took turns peeping at the likes of Jackie Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev. Even New York City\u2019s glamorous mayor, John Lindsay, showed up.\n\nThis was an unexpected turn of events. \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d was very much a ghetto play, a peephole aimed at gay men. In writing it, Crowley had deliberately taken up the challenge tossed down by the theater critic Stanley Kauffmann, who in a 1966 New York Times essay headlined \u201cHomosexual Drama and Its Disguises\u201d asked why that era\u2019s most famous gay playwrights \u2014 meaning Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and William Inge \u2014 didn\u2019t write about themselves and leave straights alone. His premise was faulty: Characters like Martha and George in \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d are not, as he suggested, gay couples in masquerade. Nor do homosexuals suffer from an \u201cemotional-psychological illness,\u201d as he casually mentions \u2014 for this was an era in which such public slurs were chic and permissible, especially in the guise of literary criticism. (In The New York Review of Books, Philip Roth derided Albee\u2019s 1964 drama \u201cTiny Alice\u201d for its \u201cghastly pansy rhetoric.\u201d) Still, there was no denying that frank plays about gay male life had never reached the mainstream, never penetrated the circles in which Kauffmanns and Roths and socialites frolicked.\n\nSo Crowley wrote the best and funniest and gayest play he could, about nine gay men (or maybe eight and a half) at a birthday party. Though some of the men finesse the ambient homophobia of the time better than others, almost all of them suffer from the self-hatred that seemed then, and maybe now, to infiltrate even the best-defended personality. (\u201cI had enough self-hatred built up in me to go around,\u201d Crowley says. \u201cI didn\u2019t need Stanley Kauffmann to tell me that.\u201d) And no one is spared the pressure cooker of the play\u2019s dramatic construction: When the well-oiled host forces the guests to play a painful game \u2014 requiring them to phone someone they have loved and confess their feelings \u2014 the tart humor of the first half turns bitter. In a Times review that thought nothing of flinging phrases like \u201cscreamingly fag\u201d and \u201cfairy queens shouting bitchicisms,\u201d Clive Barnes nonetheless acknowledged that \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d was \u201cquite an achievement\u201d and \u201ca gripping, if painful experience.\u201d\n\nRevisited 50 years later, it still is. It leaps off the page like fat from a wok. That\u2019s one of the reasons it remains a classic gay play, despite its overpowering association with the 1960s. (The dialogue crackles with the casual racism and misogyny of the time, much as Kauffmann\u2019s prose glitters with homophobia.) Still, the revival of \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d \u2014 making its belated Broadway debut in a slimmed-down one-act version that opens on May 31 \u2014 is more than just an acknowledgment of its theatricality. It is also an acknowledgment of a larger urgency about the representation of gay men in popular entertainment: a moment that, in the theater at least, is both springboard and eulogy. At a time when many of the classic gay plays are returning to the Broadway stage \u2014 \u201cBoys in the Band,\u201d \u201cAngels in America\u201d and \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d among them \u2014 almost no new ones are on the horizon to join them.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"The Unsung\" by Keenan Teddy Smith.\n\nThere\u2019s an irony in this, as the same qualities that made those classics classic also made them, in their original runs, almost impossible to stage. No one wanted to touch \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d at first: no producers, no theater owners, no actors. When Luckinbill, then 33, agreed to play Hank \u2014 the \u201cstraightest\u201d of the gay men, who\u2019d left his wife and children \u2014 his agent said he might as well bid goodbye to his career. She was, mind you, the play\u2019s agent too, a lesbian herself. But so heavy and lingering was the perfume of gayness coming off the project that even a heterosexual actor like Luckinbill was thought to be committing theatrical suicide to book it. Mostly out of friendship for Crowley, a college chum, he did.\n\nLuckinbill went on to have a very full career onstage and on screen \u2014 and so, to everyone\u2019s surprise, did \u201cThe Boys in the Band.\u201d As the sixth-row presence of Jackie and Groucho suggests, it crossed over into mainstream awareness and even found success, running for 1,001 performances. William Friedkin\u2019s faithful movie version, released in 1970 and starring the entire stage cast, turned it into a touchstone of gay style and suffering for gays and straights well beyond New York. As such, it is without doubt the first play in the American gay male theatrical canon.\n\nI write that admiring many of its spiritual forebears, from Tennessee Williams\u2019s \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d in 1945 to Robert Anderson\u2019s \u201cTea and Sympathy\u201d in 1953 to the early works of Doric Wilson, Lanford Wilson, Robert Patrick and many others who helped spark an efflorescence of downtown gay drama centered at Caffe Cino, with its makeshift milk-crate stage, starting in 1958.\n\nBut while building on those \u2014 and, Crowley says, on Arthur Laurents\u2019s screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1948 film, \u201cRope,\u201d in which two gay men murder a classmate for sport \u2014 \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d has had the more consequential gay trajectory. If you doubt it, look at the names involved in the 50th-anniversary revival: Jim Parsons plays the party\u2019s host, Michael; Matt Bomer is Donald, Michael\u2019s ambivalent ex; Zachary Quinto is Harold, the \u201cugly pockmarked Jew fairy\u201d birthday boy; and Andrew Rannells is Larry, one half of the play\u2019s only established (if iffy) couple. They and the rest of the starry cast are successful, openly gay men, as are the producers, Ryan Murphy and David Stone, and the director, Joe Mantello.\n\nThis was a deliberate statement, meant to acknowledge how far the world has come since 1968. \u201cThe guys that are the leads,\u201d Murphy says, \u201care the first generation of gay actors who said, \u2018We\u2019re going to live authentic lives and hope and pray our careers remain on track\u2019 \u2014 and they have. I find that profound.\u201d\n\nImage A still from the set of William Friedkin\u2019s 1970 film version of \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d which starred the entire theatrical cast. Credit Mptv Images\n\nCrowley could never have predicted that. In 1968 he sent his play into a world that, however much it might laugh at his gay zingers, seemed likely to remain forever and fundamentally hostile. Mantello points out the startling paradox that all the gay members of the original company felt compelled to stay in the closet \u201ceven though they were in a groundbreaking play about gay men.\u201d\n\nBut the way the world sees gay people and the way gay people see themselves have changed so much, and of late so fast, that plays from even just a few years ago can seem like Ken Burns documentaries. In one sense, then, the classic gay plays are educational: reminding a complacent generation of the struggles and tragedies (and fabulousness) that underlie the glossy image of rapid progress. The normalization of gayness that has in most ways been a boon has also shrunk the historical eye to, well, another peephole. Further progress, much needed, requires a fuller view. And who\u2019s to say the momentous changes of the last 50 years can\u2019t be swiftly undone?\n\n\u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d helped incite those changes, allowing for its reappearance now as a triumph of liberation instead of an embarrassment to the liberators. The mistake the play\u2019s many gay critics have made is in thinking that transformative art should be a form of boosterism. Rather, transformative art is needling, Cassandra-like, telling uncomfortable truths you ignore at your peril. \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d once seen, couldn\u2019t be unseen. \u201cThe people who criticize the play have the luxury to do so because of the play,\u201d Mantello says.\n\nIndeed, part of the reason \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d so clearly marks the start of the canon is the way it was swallowed up almost instantly by what it helped to spawn. In the aftermath of the Stonewall riots of 1969, while the play still ran, its portrayal of gay male life came to be seen as counterrevolutionary, which was exactly backward, if understandable in light of the rebranding underway. The characters\u2019 promiscuous, boa-flinging, \u201cOh, Mary\u201d-spouting, drown-your-troubles-in-a-vodka-bottle histrionics were distinctly off-message during the years when gay men were trying to cultivate lawmakers and police with their new images as activists or pillars of the community, not of Sodom. Even Albee, who Crowley suspects invested secretly in the original production, once tarred the play as \u201ca highly skillful work that I despised\u201d because it \u201cdid serious damage to a burgeoning gay respectability movement.\u201d\n\nWere there not nellies at Stonewall? In any case, when respectability came, it came at an awful price. AIDS, which drove the last nail in the play\u2019s reputational coffin, also killed off most of its cast. Between 1984 and 1993, five of the gay men in the original production, as well as the director, Robert Moore, and the producer, Richard Barr, died of the disease.\n\nImage From left: Rannells.

Styled by Jay Massacret\n\nAct II. The Canon\n\nAND YET AIDS, with its gaudy ironies, would create the conditions that turned a \u201crespectability movement\u201d into a civil rights revolution. It would also create the conditions that produced \u2014 even necessitated \u2014 most of the indisputably canonical gay plays that succeeded \u201cThe Boys in the Band.\u201d Because both the disease and the revolution were centered in New York, the country\u2019s theatrical capital, it makes sense that those plays are all set in the city. And because I\u2019m writing about plays that have shaped gay male life, it\u2019s not surprising that all the playwrights I name are gay men.\n\nIt hardly needs arguing that one of them is Tony Kushner, whose play \u201cAngels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,\u201d opened on Broadway in 1993. A revival, starring Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield, opens on March 25 \u2014 but unlike \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d \u201cAngels\u201d never really went away, never suffered a Siberian holiday of political reeducation. Perhaps that\u2019s because Kushner, putting so much into it, ensured it would always have something to put out. If you don\u2019t like the story of faithless Louis leaving his lover, Prior, who develops AIDS, there\u2019s the one about the closeted lawyer (and Trump fixer) Roy Cohn, denying the disease outright. Or perhaps you prefer something more aeronautical? There\u2019s one of those title angels for that, bearing a cryptic mission for mankind. Plus a heroic drag queen, a drug-addled wife, rabbis, Mormons and Ethel Rosenberg.\n\nIt\u2019s what I call a goulash work, though Kushner prefers the term lasagna: a dish that almost melts the borders of form in its quest for sublimity. It is also, in its more intimate scenes, so funny and argumentative, so vatic, so sharp and so unconcerned with gay respectability that you can see a straight line leading back to \u201cThe Boys in the Band.\u201d Both plays, after all, are about closet cases and fidelity and gay men taking care of one another \u2014 or not.\n\nI retract the \u201cstraight line,\u201d though; more aptly, it\u2019s a bent one, passing through other canonical plays, each contributing an element of style or stagecraft along the way. In the 25 years between \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d and \u201cAngels in America\u201d there are two, or possibly three, by my accounting. The two are Harvey Fierstein\u2019s \u201cTorch Song Trilogy,\u201d a collection of three related one-act plays first seen on Broadway in 1982, and Larry Kramer\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d from 1985. The third is Paul Rudnick\u2019s \u201cJeffrey,\u201d which \u2014 in a 1992 replay of Crowley\u2019s 1968 experience \u2014 could not at first find a producer, a theater or a cast.\n\nVideo The director reads \"Morning Scene\" by Jameson Fitzpatrick.\n\nWhat makes \u201cJeffrey\u201d just a possible third? It\u2019s a comedy, and comedies, short of Shakespeare\u2019s or Wilde\u2019s, are unstable. Over time, they seem to decompose more easily than dramas, revealing off flavors. True, \u201cJeffrey\u201d is not an ordinary comedy; it\u2019s a comedy about AIDS, and a romantic comedy at that \u2014 a genre that shouldn\u2019t have been possible, and wasn\u2019t until Rudnick decided it was needed. \u201cComedy is often the only feasible antidote to a completely justifiable, but not very entertaining hopelessness,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cSometimes, a wisecrack is a weapon.\u201d\n\nSo \u201cJeffrey,\u201d which ran for two years Off Broadway and was made into a movie in 1995, is crafted like a drama, squeezing incompatible things together in a small space and forcing them to collide. But because Rudnick\u2019s characters \u2014 an interior decorator, a bartender, a chorus boy in \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 are professionally amusing, so is the result. Jeffrey himself is a gay cater-waiter in his 30s who, rather than worry about what is safe, decides to remain celibate forever. Everyone around him is horrified at this \u201cone real blasphemy \u2014 the refusal of joy,\u201d even as one of his friends is dying. \u201cHow dare you give up sex,\u201d says a priest, \u201cwhen there are children in Europe who can\u2019t get a date!\u201d\n\n\u201cJeffrey\u201d is full of merriment but you always understand that the domestic problems faced by couples in straight romantic comedies have here been raised to an existential plane. \u201cIf you want comedies to be really funny you have to have the biggest possible obstacles,\u201d Rudnick says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what AIDS handed me and everyone else.\u201d\n\nIn a way, then, \u201cJeffrey\u201d is the inverse of Kramer\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and a crucial counterweight to it. When \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d opened at the Public Theater just four years after the first reports of what would soon be called AIDS, it felt less like a play than like war reporting. Kramer was nothing if not embedded; this was his own story, lightly fictionalized in the character of Ned Weeks and happening in real time. Emphasizing that, the set design by Eugene Lee and Keith Raywood featured on the theater\u2019s walls a running list of the names of the dead, along with the mounting death toll, subtotaled by state.\n\nImage Actors on stage at Theater Four in New York circa 1969. Credit Photo by Martha Swope / the New York Public Library\n\nThe action largely tracks Kramer\u2019s furious battle to get the government, the medical establishment and gay men themselves to pay attention to the disaster that was just beginning to engulf them. But Kramer was also battling the gay theatrical tradition, which he saw, even before AIDS, as petty, artificial and insufficiently political. (He criticized \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d for its \u201cinternalized homophobia.\u201d) \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d is a fierce corrective to those perceived faults, but it\u2019s not merely the rant some people remember. The story of Ned\u2019s public efforts is mirrored in his private effort to save his lover, Felix, a closeted New York Times writer dying of AIDS. The play ends with their \u201cmarriage\u201d at Felix\u2019s deathbed \u2014 a marriage in quotes because it wouldn\u2019t have been legal in New York for another quarter century.\n\n\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d is canonical not just for its anger and prescience, though these should be enough to canonize Kramer. The play saved lives, scaring its audiences into reality in a way that the vague public-health information of the time utterly failed to do. It also reframed the way we would forever look at gay men and gay theater. That did not mean abjuring love as a subject, but rather ennobling it while understanding its limitations. Hence the title, taken from a passage in Auden\u2019s poem \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d about the \u201cerror bred in the bone / Of each woman and each man.\u201d That error is much deadlier than mere disease. It is the impossible craving of the \u201cnormal heart\u201d: \u201cNot universal love / But to be loved alone.\u201d\n\nAuden, a poet, shows these drives as divergent; Kramer, a dramatist, looks at how they converge. For him as for most playwrights, the conjoint themes of society and self \u2014 twined in an embrace that is intimate yet suffocating \u2014 are the basis of all great theater. Without the \u201cself\u201d part, a play is rarely engaging. Without the \u201csociety\u201d part, it is (no matter how engaging) inconsequential.\n\nThat\u2019s why my canon starts when it does. For gay playwrights writing before 1960, the link between self and society was severed by homophobia: The self could not engage openly with society, or not, at least, in front of society. Which doesn\u2019t mean there were no great plays with gay characters by gay playwrights: Look again at \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Tom \u2014 as the performances by Quinto and Mantello in the two most recent Broadway revivals make plain \u2014 can only be understood as a furtive homosexual. But Tom\u2019s crypto-proto-gayness doesn\u2019t make \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d a gay play; it\u2019s merely a great one.\n\nTurns out those celebrities slumming at \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d mattered. Just as white bons vivants had been cultivating (some might say appropriating) black Harlem for generations, the straights and A-listers heading to Theater Four in their limos helped carry the news, like a virus, back with them. I don\u2019t mean to be snarky; this was not always a cultural safari, a hunt for the most exotic new trophies. Some came to learn, to be changed. And yet one of the things \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d (and the other plays I\u2019m writing about) did was to show nongay audiences just how gay their lives already were. Their suffering, their hubris, their senses of humor were more familiar than not. Who, after all, had been doing their hair?\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Translation\" by Julian Randall.\n\nSo the efficacy of the canonical gay plays did not depend, or depend only, on gay audiences. Countless gay men couldn\u2019t stand these works anyway. If they weren\u2019t too angry, they were too passive; if not too camp, too mirthless. Like other marginalized groups \u2014 Jews of an earlier generation who objected to the tenement soap operas of Clifford Odets; blacks who found Uncle Tomism in Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d \u2014 many gays saw betrayal in honest, let alone exaggerated, portraits. Yet who wants a banal portrait?\n\nWhich naturally brings us to Fierstein, whose play \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d succeeded by forcing exaggeration and banality to share a bed. His hero, Arnold Beckoff, is a drag performer, lip-syncing fabulousness by night but dreaming of, and eventually achieving, ordinary life pleasures by day. It\u2019s quite a journey, not least because it echoes that of many gay men over the last 50 years. In the first play, \u201cThe International Stud,\u201d we watch Arnold bend over, brightly chattering, as a stranger penetrates him. In the farcical second play, \u201cFugue in a Nursery,\u201d he observes and experiments with coupledom. By the third play, \u201cWidows and Children First,\u201d he lives in a simulacrum of a straight sitcom: He is a single father raising a son while managing an ex. The crux of the drama is that old standby, a fight (albeit a thrilling one) with his mother.\n\nAll of this takes place, and was produced on Broadway as a single four-hour work, just as AIDS was dawning. The play\u2019s dramatic trajectory suggests the path that gayness \u2014 and gay theater \u2014 might have taken without the plague. Yet the plague did not, as you might expect, drastically attenuate the story\u2019s effectiveness and charm. Last fall\u2019s Off Broadway revival, starring Michael Urie as Arnold and Mercedes Ruehl as his mother, played like gangbusters. (Fierstein did trim it by about an hour.) Notably, it was the more outr\u00e9 material from the first and second parts that seemed to have aged. The more conventional mother-son fight in the third was as riveting as ever.\n\nImage From left: Carver.

Credit Photograph by Inez and Vinoodh. Styled by Jay Massacret\n\nAct III. Next\n\nTHAT\u2019S A CURIOUS thing. Coming out and defending one\u2019s life is supposed to be old news for white urban gays like Arnold. Gay parenting, too, is no longer shocking; there are television comedies about it (and, speaking for myself, the comedy of actually being a gay parent). For that matter, the themes of the other plays on my list are not exactly futuristic. In some ways they even seem backward.\n\nBut their stories are somehow evergreen, as the 2011 Broadway revival of \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and the 2014 HBO film made clear. (The stage version starred Mantello and the film was directed by Murphy; the two are clearly the doyens of the gay canonic renaissance.) It\u2019s not just that these productions happened, though it\u2019s part of the deal for a canonical play to be reproducible. The 2017 revival of \u201cTorch Song\u201d (as its title is now rendered) is transferring to Broadway in the fall. \u201cJeffrey,\u201d too, may be theater hunting; a recent reading starring Urie and Russell Tovey was in part an experiment to see how it lands today.\n\nThe deeper reason this material holds up despite being so tied to its times is that gayness, even now, does not operate as other minority identities do. Gay people are not usually raised in gay families, the way Jews are raised in Jewish ones, and blacks in black ones; gays have to invent their identity from scratch in every generation. And even if there were a healthy tradition of mentorship by gay elders, the population of gay elders \u2014 the ones who would now be in their 60s and 70s \u2014 was decimated by AIDS. So whatever advances have been made in supportive parenting, the process by which a gay man finds himself and his people is much the same as it ever was: Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Or to put it more gaily, you are what we were.\n\nFor Murphy, such intellectual workarounds are unnecessary; he finds \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d forward-thinking whether or not you consider that it was written in a time when \u201cyou could literally be arrested\u201d for being gay. \u201cEverything discussed in it\u201d \u2014 hatred, self-hatred, debates about monogamy \u2014 \u201cis happening now,\u201d he says. Nor has gay style gone out of style. \u201cI defy you to tell me the difference between \u2018Oh, Mary, don\u2019t ask,\u2019 and \u2018Yaaas Kween,\u2019 \u201d Mantello says. \u201cAnd to pretend that shame does not exist because of all the strides of the past years just seems unrealistic.\u201d\n\nThe persistence of gay shame, an element of all these plays, is certainly troubling, yet I wonder if what we\u2019re seeing today is really the same thing. Maybe gay shame is itself being appropriated, or merging with the common human shame that writers have been anatomizing since Adam and Eve. That would explain why the canonical gay plays have always spoken to nongay audiences, and why today, when other forms of marginalization are so pressing, they speak more urgently, not less. Is gay history so far past that it now passes for everyone\u2019s?\n\nImage A 1970 promotional image for the film. Credit National General / Photofest\n\nToo soon to tell. It\u2019s hardly been more than a decade, Murphy says, since he got notes nixing gay characters on his TV shows. \u201cAre we really so much better off than we were 50 years ago?\u201d\n\nIf not, it may be time for a new canon. The one I\u2019ve sketched ended in 1993. Yours may include such fine gay plays as \u201cBent,\u201d \u201cThe Laramie Project,\u201d \u201cAs Is,\u201d \u201cFifth of July,\u201d \u201cThe Dying Gaul,\u201d \u201cTake Me Out,\u201d \u201cLove! Valour! Compassion!\u201d and the musical \u201cFalsettos.\u201d Or you might include works by and about women, from \u201cLast Summer at Bluefish Cove\u201d by Jane Chambers to the musical \u201cFun Home\u201d by Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori, based on Alison Bechdel\u2019s graphic novel, to Paula Vogel\u2019s \u201cIndecent.\u201d What gives me pause when I look at my own list of gay male playwrights is not their gender or generation; it\u2019s that all of them are white, and all but Crowley Jewish. It\u2019s perhaps too easy to say that these are the demographics that had access to the microphone, and that revisiting this in a few years will produce different results, as others succeed in scratching out the opportunities that gave Kushner and Kramer their platforms.\n\nBut great plays arise from something even great playwrights cannot control: great catastrophes. They may be political, social, medical or even personal \u2014 though if personal then personal in a way that anticipates the zeitgeist. White gay men of the type who write popular plays have few specifically gay disasters left to mine; a windfall, no doubt, for their well-being but not for the theater. Luckinbill, reflecting on \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d has said that the \u201cgreat truth\u201d of the play is that \u201cgay people are ordinary.\u201d But that insight can only be mind-blowing once.\n\nThe gay plays I\u2019ve been seeing more recently are variously charming, sexy, provocative and beautifully crafted. Sometimes, as in the 2015 comedies \u201cSteve\u201d by Mark Gerrard and \u201cDada Woof Papa Hot\u201d by Peter Parnell, they deal with timely subjects \u2014 parenting, aging \u2014 that, for me anyway, hit close to home. But issues like these are a bit baggy for great drama, and plays that question the homonormative movement (like Drew Droege\u2019s hilarious 2016 anti-marriage screed \u201cBright Colors and Bold Patterns\u201d) seem destined for a short shelf life. Even Crowley\u2019s 2002 sequel to \u201cBoys in the Band,\u201d almost inevitably titled \u201cThe Men From the Boys,\u201d washes up on the rocks of maturity. Three of the \u201cboys\u201d are in A.A. now.\n\nThe palette of these works is grayer, more tasteful. Sometimes, to judge from what\u2019s onstage, I have to conclude that Crate & Barrel is sponsoring the new gay agenda. And whether such plays even qualify as gay depends on your definition of \u201cgay plays.\u201d (An old theater joke says they are plays that have sex with other plays.) Presumably a gay play is defined in part by its focus on gay characters and gay life, but it is more than that, too. A gay play has a gay voice \u2014 one that may now be disappearing along with its literal cognate: the lisping, purse-lipped, tooth-sucking caricature bequeathed to us by the likes of Liberace and Paul Lynde. A play\u2019s gay voice, though, is more than just inflection; it\u2019s fundamental. It\u2019s quick-witted, protean, emotional. In the way only formerly suppressed things can be, it insists on largeness. The largeness may be conceptual or political or literal; \u201cAngels\u201d weighs in somewhere between seven and eight hours. Great gay plays are large because the fight they dramatize is about more than diapers, weddings or credenzas. In \u201cAngels\u201d and \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d the characters are fighting for their lives. In \u201cJeffrey,\u201d terror is the enemy. \u201cTorch Song\u201d and \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d wage a war for dignity. Goulash or lasagna, these are five-course meals.\n\nCan it be that \u201cAngels\u201d \u2014 the play that proclaims \u201cThe great work begins!\u201d \u2014 is actually the end of the line? After 25 years without a similarly thundering new entry into the canon, it may be time to recognize that the spotlight is moving on. As if turning Kauffmann\u2019s 1966 essay on its head, many of the best young gay male playwrights \u2014 Stephen Karam, Jordan Harrison, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins \u2014 no longer write about gay people anyway, or write about them only peripherally. Adam Bock\u2019s \u201cA Life,\u201d produced Off Broadway in 2016, is a terrific, terrifying fantasia on the afterlife whose main character merely happens to be gay.\n\nImage\n\n\n\nFrom left: Quinto in a Giorgio Armani sweater, $825, On the Cover | The cast of \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d is featured in T\u2019s March 4 Men\u2019s Style issue.From left: Quinto in a Giorgio Armani sweater, $825, armani.com , Scotch & Soda jeans, $165, scotch-soda.com , and Adidas Originals sneakers, $75, adidas.com .

Styled by Jay Massacret\n\nThat\u2019s fine; it means that playwrights representing other backgrounds and other letters in the LGBTQ coalition may get a shot at the culture\u2019s widest attention. When Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s \u201cChoir Boy\u201d opens in 2019 at Manhattan Theatre Club, it will likely be the first black gay male play ever seen on Broadway. And Matthew Lopez\u2019s \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d starts performances in London this month. It is a homage, at least in size and two-part structure, to \u201cAngels\u201d but also to E.M. Forster\u2019s \u201cHowards End.\u201d If \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d hews to the Forsterian theme of nostalgia for a purposeful past, as its title suggests it may, it would be a very apt gay play for this particular moment.\n\nBut among new works I\u2019ve actually seen, the only gay \u2014 or, rather, queer \u2014 theater piece that rises to the level of those I\u2019ve beatified is Taylor Mac\u2019s \u201cA 24-Decade History of Popular Music,\u201d which premiered as a complete work at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn in 2016. And I\u2019ve only seen part of it; the dragtastic marathon nightclub act is 24 hours long. (I listened to the rest.) Miraculously, it combines Kushner\u2019s vision, Kramer\u2019s anger, Crowley\u2019s cattiness, Fierstein\u2019s warmth and Rudnick\u2019s wit (plus a whole lot else) into one subversive astonishment, forcibly making room in American history for all of those previously omitted. Its entire structure \u2014 the repurposing of popular songs from \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy\u201d to \u201cBorn to Run\u201d so they tell suppressed stories \u2014 suggests the idea that canons are meant to be hijacked.\n\nOn the other hand, Rudnick isn\u2019t finished with the old canon yet. He\u2019s working on an unabashedly gay play called \u201cBig Night,\u201d inspired by the 2016 murders at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. It\u2019s a comedy.\n\nHair by Jimmy Paul at Susan Price NYC. Hair assistants: Evanie Frausto, Felicia Burrows, Levi Monarch.

While it was Giacometti who conceived the whimsical bronze pieces dripping with tiny flora and fauna, it was Anthonioz who did most of the fabrication; his spidery chairs, benches and oversize resin chandeliers form a conceptual bridge between the building\u2019s 17th-century architecture and Picasso\u2019s slashing Modernism. \u201cI am proud of what we did, of course,\u201d Anthonioz says, recalling the generosity of the older artist, whom he had first met when he was 13 through his well-connected father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be defined by that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Anthonioz \u2014 who mostly sculpts in wood and plaster that is often cast in bronze \u2014 is known for his large-scale, abstract public statuary and custom-made lighting and functional objects for architects including Joseph Dirand, the fashion designer Tomas Maier and the interiors brand Ralph Pucci, for which he makes a line of bronze torchieres. Since 1979, he has kept his main studio in Passage Saint Bernard, a two-block-long cobblestone street not far from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, Afi Nayo, a Togolese mixed-media artist.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he moved in, the alley had been home to generations of the city\u2019s furniture-makers, restorers and ebonizers. For the first 15 years, he occupied the second floor of No. 17, a magnificent 18th-century wooden building that was torn down to make way for an apartment complex in the mid-1990s, part of a short-lived attempt by Paris officials to erect new housing. But Anthonioz, enamored of the neighborhood\u2019s gritty charm \u2014 he compares it to Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, back before the boutiques descended in the early aughts \u2014 remained, moving a few doors down to the 1,600-square-foot ground floor of another 18th-century building, one accessible through an aged oak door. \u201cIf there is no romance in the environment,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to make good things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike the studios of many contemporary artists, which are often minimalist affairs, defiantly ahistorical, his is redolent of the past. The front is an art-book-filled office-cum-salon, with walls hung with antique mirrors and vintage photos, including one of Charles Baudelaire, his lodestar; the back is a workshop crowded with stone arms and torsos, piled alongside pieces of old chandeliers used to construct limited-edition light fixtures for spaces like Loulou, the Dirand-designed restaurant in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Frosted with fine plaster dust, the space itself seems sepia-toned, like a Eug\u00e8ne Atget photograph.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Anthonioz and Giacometti shared the belief that there should be no dividing line between decoration and fine art, their aesthetics diverged radically. Giacometti was obsessed with figuration and the natural world \u2014 he spent hours studying birds in the city\u2019s Jardin des Plantes, where Henri Rousseau had once found inspiration \u2014 but Anthonioz has always been driven by abstraction. Giacometti was a master of affixing tiny animals and curling leaves to the bronze framework of his designs, lending them a fey quality; Anthonioz eschews ornament, preferring sleek minimalist shapes. \u201cPeople always speak of me in the same breath as Diego, but I think of Carlo Scarpa, David Smith or even the Bauhaus,\u201d he says.\n\nIndeed, his sculptures have become increasingly monumental in recent years \u2014 the eight-foot-tall \u201cLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e,\u201d a cast-bronze totem, was installed in Pratt Institute\u2019s Brooklyn sculpture garden in 2016 \u2014 so he now works part-time in a lofty second studio in Ivry-sur-Seine, a southeastern suburb. He is also restoring an 18th-century farmhouse in the south, near Aix-en-Provence, where he plans to make work in his later years, in a barn he\u2019s converting into a studio. There, he hopes his five grown children will bring their own kids to run in the fields. \u201cMy work has gotten more abstract, maybe even more modern, as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog on a leash \u2014 not in what I create, and not in how I live my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["works", "charles", "sculptor", "work", "sculptors", "parisian", "inside", "studio", "18thcentury", "tiny", "world", "wonders", "giacometti", "anthonioz", "bronze"], "polarity": 0.1389933820968304, "subjectivity": 0.38793414439966156},

Buck, the first American woman to win the award, whose 1930s novels about Chinese peasant life now read as twee and patronizing Orientalist fairy tales.\n\nNot all works of art age as well as others. Some remain consistent sources of wonder and awe and provocation for century upon century; others, removed from their context, curdle into irrelevance, if not offensiveness. The artist\u2019s difficult job is to create something that addresses the concerns of her time while also contending with the timeless: the needs and desires and frustrations that are particular not to a certain age, but to human existence. The stuff that endures is the work that does both, that manages to reflect a moment while also transcending it. But the vast majority of art is subject to the ebb and flow of cultural tides. Sometimes it\u2019s buried beneath the wave, and sometimes \u2014 when circumstances change \u2014 it\u2019s tossed up again to the surface, a reminder of lost treasure glinting on the water\u2019s crest.\n\nThe subject of our cover story, \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d is a good example of how a piece of art born from a specific moment can find itself newly resonant in an entirely different one. When Mart Crowley\u2019s play opened Off Broadway in 1968, it was an instant and surprise hit, a by turns vicious, lacerating, bitingly funny and squirm-inducing portrait of eight (maybe nine) gay men at a disastrous birthday party in New York. This May, it will have its Broadway debut, with a cast composed entirely of out gay actors, produced and directed by out gay men. The fact that there are now enough openly gay, well-known working actors to populate a Broadway ensemble play \u2014 and, indeed, to be considered draws \u2014 is remarkable: both because many of us remember when this would never have been possible ... but also because many of us can\u2019t imagine it would ever be anything but possible.\n\nIn the intervening five decades between the play\u2019s premiere and its latest revival \u2014 50 years that have seen the Stonewall riots, the official de-pathologization of homosexuality (which was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders only in 1973), AIDS and same-sex marriage \u2014 Crowley\u2019s work has been assessed and reassessed, revived and dismissed, beloved and reviled. But it has always, as The Times\u2019s co-chief theater critic Jesse Green notes in his lovely, searching essay, been relevant, a work of art that every gay playwright since its debut has had to be in conversation with in one way or another. \u201cBoys\u201d was, Green writes, \u201cvery much a ghetto play, a peephole aimed at gay men.\u201d The titular boys were to be witnessed and gawked at; Crowley sought to humanize them, but humanization came through objectification and minimization. (They were boys, after all, not men.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf all the significant changes of the past half-century, one of the greatest must surely be the increasing and hard-won recognition that gay lives are, first, lives. The struggle for civil rights in this country is the struggle to be granted full humanity, to be secure in the basic dignities \u2014 the right to vote, to own property, to marry, to be educated, to be protected by due process \u2014 that every citizen is entitled to and deserves. It is why this play, a chronicle of men living in an era in which those rights were elusive, has such meaning today. Yes, some of the references might be dated (not to mention the costumes: one turtleneck is one too many), but its exploration of the human toll of being denied full personhood is not.\n\nProgress is never straightforward, a projectile fired into space and left to sail upward in a clean trajectory; it halts and recedes and sputters, and requires constant vigilance. (As Green reminds us, it wasn\u2019t so long ago that The Times\u2019s review of \u201cBoys\u201d \u201cthought nothing of flinging phrases like \u2018screamingly fag\u2019 and \u2018fairy queens shouting bitchicisms.\u2019 \u201d) \u201cBoys\u201d is, often, wildly entertaining.

So it can hardly be ignored that the play\u2019s 50th-anniversary revival, opening this spring on Broadway, is addressing a radically different culture, one that \u2014 on the surface, at least \u2014 seems to have sacrificed this undeniably queen-y play on its march toward equality.\n\nAs the actor Zachary Quinto told The New York Times\u2019s co-chief theater critic Jesse Green in an interview for his essay, he originally had \u201ca dismissive take\u201d on \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d having never seen it. But after reading the script and speaking with the producers, he eventually agreed to the part of Harold, the sharp-tongued gay man whose birthday provides the play with its setting. \u201cThe criticism was that it offered a stereotypical quality to who these characters are,\u201d Quinto said. \u201cBut what gets lost is that characters like these had never been seen on the American stage before.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nT\u2019s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara, saw an early reading of the play last summer and \u201cwas struck by how crackling and relevant this 50-year-old play still was: its humor, but also how vividly it telegraphed the characters\u2019 shame and despair,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what made it poignant was seeing, before me, nine openly gay actors who had made successful careers for themselves as themselves. I knew by the end of the reading that this would be an important cultural moment, and that I wanted the cast for the cover of T.\u201d\n\nMagazines being what they are, Yanagihara adds, it took about six months of planning before the cast gathered for T\u2019s Dec. 17 shoot in New York, photographed by Inez and Vinoodh.

Today, of course, there are many words, a whole forest of words, and descriptors of sexual identity are increasingly paired with those for gender identity \u2014 gender being among the first ways you relate to yourself. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a word for it,\u201d James Baldwin said of his sexuality as a young boy growing up in Harlem in the 1930s, but now he just might \u2014 he might even have four or five.\n\nDanez Smith, 28, who curated the below selection of poems read by the cast and director of \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d in this video series, and who goes by the pronoun \u201cthey,\u201d is a good example of how we talk about ourselves now: They are black, queer, poz, a poet, a performer. \u201cWhen I was figuring myself out, both as a writer and a queer person, I had examples of how to do it boldly and bravely \u2014 Assotto Saint, Essex Hemphill, Carl Phillips, Mark Doty, Jericho Brown \u2014 and there was never a push toward ambiguity,\u201d Smith says. \u201cInstead, it was a push toward a queer poetics, and a queer poetics of color.\u201d\n\nSmith, whose 2017 collection, \u201cDon\u2019t Call Us Dead,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist, is a risen star in a fast-expanding galaxy of talented queer poets: Saeed Jones, Ocean Vuong, Alex Dimitrov, Hieu Minh Nguyen, Marcelo Hernandez Castillo, Max McDonough, Richie Hofmann, Julian Randall, Keenan Teddy Smith, Jameson Fitzpatrick. This band, boys or not, is making the most of our expanded vocabulary, playing with language to make work that speaks \u2014 profoundly and unapologetically \u2014 to who they are, where they come from and where they are going. As Danez Smith says of the iconic 1987 ACT UP slogan, \u201c\u2018Silence=Death\u2019 showed us that our freedom was in our visibility.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s queer poets, of the moment in every way, have taken the lesson of visibility a step further, cultivating digital identities (see Dimitrov\u2019s Astro Poets project with Dorothea Lasky) to bypass traditional gatekeepers; a photo of a poem published (or not) in a small journal can reach many thousands more readers when posted on Instagram or Tumblr. This also liberates poetry from its expected contexts: Take, for example, AM2DM, the BuzzFeed News morning show on Twitter co-hosted by Saeed Jones, which recently featured the poet Morgan Parker reading her work. These poets are reaching through difference, instead of across it, to make prismatic moments of connection.\n\n\u201cThe world is just queerer now,\u201d Smith says of this golden age of queer poetry. But the world is also strained in a way that has made people eager to celebrate queer art. Reading through Smith\u2019s selections, 10 of which appear below, I keep returning to this line from Jones\u2019s \u201cBoy in Stolen Evening Gown\u201d \u2014 Sir who is no one, sir who is yet to come, I need you \u2014 and a vision of these poets arriving, as if answering a call, fills my mind. The yet to come, now here.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"The Unsung\" by Keenan Teddy Smith.\n\nVideo The director reads \"Morning Scene\" by Jameson Fitzpatrick.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Translation\" by Julian Randall.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Book of Statues\" by Richie Hofmann.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Egg Harbor\" by Max McDonough.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Homewrecker\" by Ocean Vuong.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Drown\" by Marcelo Hernandez Castillo.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"People\" by Alex Dimitrov.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Heavy\" by Hieu Minh Nguyen.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Boy in Stolen Evening Gown\" by Saeed Jones.\n\nRelated:\n\nA Brief History of Gay Theater, in Three Acts\n\nThe Story Behind T\u2019s \u2018The Boys in the Band\u2019 Cover\n\nT\u2019s Men\u2019s Style Issue: Feats of Endurance\n\nSign up for the Open Thread Newsletter A look from across the New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

The Party\n\nONE EVENING NOT long after \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d had its Off Broadway premiere in April 1968, Laurence Luckinbill, who played Hank, brought his tool kit to work. Theater Four, as the joint was called, was a dowdy old converted church in a part of Manhattan that the play\u2019s author, Mart Crowley, called a \u201csenseless-killing neighborhood.\u201d But Luckinbill wasn\u2019t lugging tools to make repairs. Instead, he drilled a hole in a piece of the set called a tormentor flat, about waist-high, so that he and his eight castmates, standing backstage, could get a glimpse of whoever was sitting sixth row center: the best seats in the house. Over the coming weeks the actors took turns peeping at the likes of Jackie Kennedy, Marlene Dietrich, Groucho Marx and Rudolf Nureyev. Even New York City\u2019s glamorous mayor, John Lindsay, showed up.\n\nThis was an unexpected turn of events. \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d was very much a ghetto play, a peephole aimed at gay men. In writing it, Crowley had deliberately taken up the challenge tossed down by the theater critic Stanley Kauffmann, who in a 1966 New York Times essay headlined \u201cHomosexual Drama and Its Disguises\u201d asked why that era\u2019s most famous gay playwrights \u2014 meaning Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and William Inge \u2014 didn\u2019t write about themselves and leave straights alone. His premise was faulty: Characters like Martha and George in \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d are not, as he suggested, gay couples in masquerade. Nor do homosexuals suffer from an \u201cemotional-psychological illness,\u201d as he casually mentions \u2014 for this was an era in which such public slurs were chic and permissible, especially in the guise of literary criticism. (In The New York Review of Books, Philip Roth derided Albee\u2019s 1964 drama \u201cTiny Alice\u201d for its \u201cghastly pansy rhetoric.\u201d) Still, there was no denying that frank plays about gay male life had never reached the mainstream, never penetrated the circles in which Kauffmanns and Roths and socialites frolicked.\n\nSo Crowley wrote the best and funniest and gayest play he could, about nine gay men (or maybe eight and a half) at a birthday party. Though some of the men finesse the ambient homophobia of the time better than others, almost all of them suffer from the self-hatred that seemed then, and maybe now, to infiltrate even the best-defended personality. (\u201cI had enough self-hatred built up in me to go around,\u201d Crowley says. \u201cI didn\u2019t need Stanley Kauffmann to tell me that.\u201d) And no one is spared the pressure cooker of the play\u2019s dramatic construction: When the well-oiled host forces the guests to play a painful game \u2014 requiring them to phone someone they have loved and confess their feelings \u2014 the tart humor of the first half turns bitter. In a Times review that thought nothing of flinging phrases like \u201cscreamingly fag\u201d and \u201cfairy queens shouting bitchicisms,\u201d Clive Barnes nonetheless acknowledged that \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d was \u201cquite an achievement\u201d and \u201ca gripping, if painful experience.\u201d\n\nRevisited 50 years later, it still is. It leaps off the page like fat from a wok. That\u2019s one of the reasons it remains a classic gay play, despite its overpowering association with the 1960s. (The dialogue crackles with the casual racism and misogyny of the time, much as Kauffmann\u2019s prose glitters with homophobia.) Still, the revival of \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d \u2014 making its belated Broadway debut in a slimmed-down one-act version that opens on May 31 \u2014 is more than just an acknowledgment of its theatricality. It is also an acknowledgment of a larger urgency about the representation of gay men in popular entertainment: a moment that, in the theater at least, is both springboard and eulogy. At a time when many of the classic gay plays are returning to the Broadway stage \u2014 \u201cBoys in the Band,\u201d \u201cAngels in America\u201d and \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d among them \u2014 almost no new ones are on the horizon to join them.\n\nVideo The actor reads \"The Unsung\" by Keenan Teddy Smith.\n\nThere\u2019s an irony in this, as the same qualities that made those classics classic also made them, in their original runs, almost impossible to stage. No one wanted to touch \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d at first: no producers, no theater owners, no actors. When Luckinbill, then 33, agreed to play Hank \u2014 the \u201cstraightest\u201d of the gay men, who\u2019d left his wife and children \u2014 his agent said he might as well bid goodbye to his career. She was, mind you, the play\u2019s agent too, a lesbian herself. But so heavy and lingering was the perfume of gayness coming off the project that even a heterosexual actor like Luckinbill was thought to be committing theatrical suicide to book it. Mostly out of friendship for Crowley, a college chum, he did.\n\nLuckinbill went on to have a very full career onstage and on screen \u2014 and so, to everyone\u2019s surprise, did \u201cThe Boys in the Band.\u201d As the sixth-row presence of Jackie and Groucho suggests, it crossed over into mainstream awareness and even found success, running for 1,001 performances. William Friedkin\u2019s faithful movie version, released in 1970 and starring the entire stage cast, turned it into a touchstone of gay style and suffering for gays and straights well beyond New York. As such, it is without doubt the first play in the American gay male theatrical canon.\n\nI write that admiring many of its spiritual forebears, from Tennessee Williams\u2019s \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d in 1945 to Robert Anderson\u2019s \u201cTea and Sympathy\u201d in 1953 to the early works of Doric Wilson, Lanford Wilson, Robert Patrick and many others who helped spark an efflorescence of downtown gay drama centered at Caffe Cino, with its makeshift milk-crate stage, starting in 1958.\n\nBut while building on those \u2014 and, Crowley says, on Arthur Laurents\u2019s screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s 1948 film, \u201cRope,\u201d in which two gay men murder a classmate for sport \u2014 \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d has had the more consequential gay trajectory. If you doubt it, look at the names involved in the 50th-anniversary revival: Jim Parsons plays the party\u2019s host, Michael; Matt Bomer is Donald, Michael\u2019s ambivalent ex; Zachary Quinto is Harold, the \u201cugly pockmarked Jew fairy\u201d birthday boy; and Andrew Rannells is Larry, one half of the play\u2019s only established (if iffy) couple. They and the rest of the starry cast are successful, openly gay men, as are the producers, Ryan Murphy and David Stone, and the director, Joe Mantello.\n\nThis was a deliberate statement, meant to acknowledge how far the world has come since 1968. \u201cThe guys that are the leads,\u201d Murphy says, \u201care the first generation of gay actors who said, \u2018We\u2019re going to live authentic lives and hope and pray our careers remain on track\u2019 \u2014 and they have. I find that profound.\u201d\n\nImage A still from the set of William Friedkin\u2019s 1970 film version of \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d which starred the entire theatrical cast. Credit Mptv Images\n\nCrowley could never have predicted that. In 1968 he sent his play into a world that, however much it might laugh at his gay zingers, seemed likely to remain forever and fundamentally hostile. Mantello points out the startling paradox that all the gay members of the original company felt compelled to stay in the closet \u201ceven though they were in a groundbreaking play about gay men.\u201d\n\nBut the way the world sees gay people and the way gay people see themselves have changed so much, and of late so fast, that plays from even just a few years ago can seem like Ken Burns documentaries. In one sense, then, the classic gay plays are educational: reminding a complacent generation of the struggles and tragedies (and fabulousness) that underlie the glossy image of rapid progress. The normalization of gayness that has in most ways been a boon has also shrunk the historical eye to, well, another peephole. Further progress, much needed, requires a fuller view. And who\u2019s to say the momentous changes of the last 50 years can\u2019t be swiftly undone?\n\n\u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d helped incite those changes, allowing for its reappearance now as a triumph of liberation instead of an embarrassment to the liberators. The mistake the play\u2019s many gay critics have made is in thinking that transformative art should be a form of boosterism. Rather, transformative art is needling, Cassandra-like, telling uncomfortable truths you ignore at your peril. \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d once seen, couldn\u2019t be unseen. \u201cThe people who criticize the play have the luxury to do so because of the play,\u201d Mantello says.\n\nIndeed, part of the reason \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d so clearly marks the start of the canon is the way it was swallowed up almost instantly by what it helped to spawn. In the aftermath of the Stonewall riots of 1969, while the play still ran, its portrayal of gay male life came to be seen as counterrevolutionary, which was exactly backward, if understandable in light of the rebranding underway. The characters\u2019 promiscuous, boa-flinging, \u201cOh, Mary\u201d-spouting, drown-your-troubles-in-a-vodka-bottle histrionics were distinctly off-message during the years when gay men were trying to cultivate lawmakers and police with their new images as activists or pillars of the community, not of Sodom. Even Albee, who Crowley suspects invested secretly in the original production, once tarred the play as \u201ca highly skillful work that I despised\u201d because it \u201cdid serious damage to a burgeoning gay respectability movement.\u201d\n\nWere there not nellies at Stonewall? In any case, when respectability came, it came at an awful price. AIDS, which drove the last nail in the play\u2019s reputational coffin, also killed off most of its cast. Between 1984 and 1993, five of the gay men in the original production, as well as the director, Robert Moore, and the producer, Richard Barr, died of the disease.\n\nImage From left: Rannells.

Styled by Jay Massacret\n\nAct II. The Canon\n\nAND YET AIDS, with its gaudy ironies, would create the conditions that turned a \u201crespectability movement\u201d into a civil rights revolution. It would also create the conditions that produced \u2014 even necessitated \u2014 most of the indisputably canonical gay plays that succeeded \u201cThe Boys in the Band.\u201d Because both the disease and the revolution were centered in New York, the country\u2019s theatrical capital, it makes sense that those plays are all set in the city. And because I\u2019m writing about plays that have shaped gay male life, it\u2019s not surprising that all the playwrights I name are gay men.\n\nIt hardly needs arguing that one of them is Tony Kushner, whose play \u201cAngels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,\u201d opened on Broadway in 1993. A revival, starring Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield, opens on March 25 \u2014 but unlike \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d \u201cAngels\u201d never really went away, never suffered a Siberian holiday of political reeducation. Perhaps that\u2019s because Kushner, putting so much into it, ensured it would always have something to put out. If you don\u2019t like the story of faithless Louis leaving his lover, Prior, who develops AIDS, there\u2019s the one about the closeted lawyer (and Trump fixer) Roy Cohn, denying the disease outright. Or perhaps you prefer something more aeronautical? There\u2019s one of those title angels for that, bearing a cryptic mission for mankind. Plus a heroic drag queen, a drug-addled wife, rabbis, Mormons and Ethel Rosenberg.\n\nIt\u2019s what I call a goulash work, though Kushner prefers the term lasagna: a dish that almost melts the borders of form in its quest for sublimity. It is also, in its more intimate scenes, so funny and argumentative, so vatic, so sharp and so unconcerned with gay respectability that you can see a straight line leading back to \u201cThe Boys in the Band.\u201d Both plays, after all, are about closet cases and fidelity and gay men taking care of one another \u2014 or not.\n\nI retract the \u201cstraight line,\u201d though; more aptly, it\u2019s a bent one, passing through other canonical plays, each contributing an element of style or stagecraft along the way. In the 25 years between \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d and \u201cAngels in America\u201d there are two, or possibly three, by my accounting. The two are Harvey Fierstein\u2019s \u201cTorch Song Trilogy,\u201d a collection of three related one-act plays first seen on Broadway in 1982, and Larry Kramer\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d from 1985. The third is Paul Rudnick\u2019s \u201cJeffrey,\u201d which \u2014 in a 1992 replay of Crowley\u2019s 1968 experience \u2014 could not at first find a producer, a theater or a cast.\n\nVideo The director reads \"Morning Scene\" by Jameson Fitzpatrick.\n\nWhat makes \u201cJeffrey\u201d just a possible third? It\u2019s a comedy, and comedies, short of Shakespeare\u2019s or Wilde\u2019s, are unstable. Over time, they seem to decompose more easily than dramas, revealing off flavors. True, \u201cJeffrey\u201d is not an ordinary comedy; it\u2019s a comedy about AIDS, and a romantic comedy at that \u2014 a genre that shouldn\u2019t have been possible, and wasn\u2019t until Rudnick decided it was needed. \u201cComedy is often the only feasible antidote to a completely justifiable, but not very entertaining hopelessness,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cSometimes, a wisecrack is a weapon.\u201d\n\nSo \u201cJeffrey,\u201d which ran for two years Off Broadway and was made into a movie in 1995, is crafted like a drama, squeezing incompatible things together in a small space and forcing them to collide. But because Rudnick\u2019s characters \u2014 an interior decorator, a bartender, a chorus boy in \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 are professionally amusing, so is the result. Jeffrey himself is a gay cater-waiter in his 30s who, rather than worry about what is safe, decides to remain celibate forever. Everyone around him is horrified at this \u201cone real blasphemy \u2014 the refusal of joy,\u201d even as one of his friends is dying. \u201cHow dare you give up sex,\u201d says a priest, \u201cwhen there are children in Europe who can\u2019t get a date!\u201d\n\n\u201cJeffrey\u201d is full of merriment but you always understand that the domestic problems faced by couples in straight romantic comedies have here been raised to an existential plane. \u201cIf you want comedies to be really funny you have to have the biggest possible obstacles,\u201d Rudnick says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what AIDS handed me and everyone else.\u201d\n\nIn a way, then, \u201cJeffrey\u201d is the inverse of Kramer\u2019s \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and a crucial counterweight to it. When \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d opened at the Public Theater just four years after the first reports of what would soon be called AIDS, it felt less like a play than like war reporting. Kramer was nothing if not embedded; this was his own story, lightly fictionalized in the character of Ned Weeks and happening in real time. Emphasizing that, the set design by Eugene Lee and Keith Raywood featured on the theater\u2019s walls a running list of the names of the dead, along with the mounting death toll, subtotaled by state.\n\nImage Actors on stage at Theater Four in New York circa 1969. Credit Photo by Martha Swope / the New York Public Library\n\nThe action largely tracks Kramer\u2019s furious battle to get the government, the medical establishment and gay men themselves to pay attention to the disaster that was just beginning to engulf them. But Kramer was also battling the gay theatrical tradition, which he saw, even before AIDS, as petty, artificial and insufficiently political. (He criticized \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d for its \u201cinternalized homophobia.\u201d) \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d is a fierce corrective to those perceived faults, but it\u2019s not merely the rant some people remember. The story of Ned\u2019s public efforts is mirrored in his private effort to save his lover, Felix, a closeted New York Times writer dying of AIDS. The play ends with their \u201cmarriage\u201d at Felix\u2019s deathbed \u2014 a marriage in quotes because it wouldn\u2019t have been legal in New York for another quarter century.\n\n\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d is canonical not just for its anger and prescience, though these should be enough to canonize Kramer. The play saved lives, scaring its audiences into reality in a way that the vague public-health information of the time utterly failed to do. It also reframed the way we would forever look at gay men and gay theater. That did not mean abjuring love as a subject, but rather ennobling it while understanding its limitations. Hence the title, taken from a passage in Auden\u2019s poem \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d about the \u201cerror bred in the bone / Of each woman and each man.\u201d That error is much deadlier than mere disease. It is the impossible craving of the \u201cnormal heart\u201d: \u201cNot universal love / But to be loved alone.\u201d\n\nAuden, a poet, shows these drives as divergent; Kramer, a dramatist, looks at how they converge. For him as for most playwrights, the conjoint themes of society and self \u2014 twined in an embrace that is intimate yet suffocating \u2014 are the basis of all great theater. Without the \u201cself\u201d part, a play is rarely engaging. Without the \u201csociety\u201d part, it is (no matter how engaging) inconsequential.\n\nThat\u2019s why my canon starts when it does. For gay playwrights writing before 1960, the link between self and society was severed by homophobia: The self could not engage openly with society, or not, at least, in front of society. Which doesn\u2019t mean there were no great plays with gay characters by gay playwrights: Look again at \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Tom \u2014 as the performances by Quinto and Mantello in the two most recent Broadway revivals make plain \u2014 can only be understood as a furtive homosexual. But Tom\u2019s crypto-proto-gayness doesn\u2019t make \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d a gay play; it\u2019s merely a great one.\n\nTurns out those celebrities slumming at \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d mattered. Just as white bons vivants had been cultivating (some might say appropriating) black Harlem for generations, the straights and A-listers heading to Theater Four in their limos helped carry the news, like a virus, back with them. I don\u2019t mean to be snarky; this was not always a cultural safari, a hunt for the most exotic new trophies. Some came to learn, to be changed. And yet one of the things \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d (and the other plays I\u2019m writing about) did was to show nongay audiences just how gay their lives already were. Their suffering, their hubris, their senses of humor were more familiar than not. Who, after all, had been doing their hair?\n\nVideo The actor reads \"Translation\" by Julian Randall.\n\nSo the efficacy of the canonical gay plays did not depend, or depend only, on gay audiences. Countless gay men couldn\u2019t stand these works anyway. If they weren\u2019t too angry, they were too passive; if not too camp, too mirthless. Like other marginalized groups \u2014 Jews of an earlier generation who objected to the tenement soap operas of Clifford Odets; blacks who found Uncle Tomism in Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d \u2014 many gays saw betrayal in honest, let alone exaggerated, portraits. Yet who wants a banal portrait?\n\nWhich naturally brings us to Fierstein, whose play \u201cTorch Song Trilogy\u201d succeeded by forcing exaggeration and banality to share a bed. His hero, Arnold Beckoff, is a drag performer, lip-syncing fabulousness by night but dreaming of, and eventually achieving, ordinary life pleasures by day. It\u2019s quite a journey, not least because it echoes that of many gay men over the last 50 years. In the first play, \u201cThe International Stud,\u201d we watch Arnold bend over, brightly chattering, as a stranger penetrates him. In the farcical second play, \u201cFugue in a Nursery,\u201d he observes and experiments with coupledom. By the third play, \u201cWidows and Children First,\u201d he lives in a simulacrum of a straight sitcom: He is a single father raising a son while managing an ex. The crux of the drama is that old standby, a fight (albeit a thrilling one) with his mother.\n\nAll of this takes place, and was produced on Broadway as a single four-hour work, just as AIDS was dawning. The play\u2019s dramatic trajectory suggests the path that gayness \u2014 and gay theater \u2014 might have taken without the plague. Yet the plague did not, as you might expect, drastically attenuate the story\u2019s effectiveness and charm. Last fall\u2019s Off Broadway revival, starring Michael Urie as Arnold and Mercedes Ruehl as his mother, played like gangbusters. (Fierstein did trim it by about an hour.) Notably, it was the more outr\u00e9 material from the first and second parts that seemed to have aged. The more conventional mother-son fight in the third was as riveting as ever.\n\nImage From left: Carver.

Coming out and defending one\u2019s life is supposed to be old news for white urban gays like Arnold. Gay parenting, too, is no longer shocking; there are television comedies about it (and, speaking for myself, the comedy of actually being a gay parent). For that matter, the themes of the other plays on my list are not exactly futuristic. In some ways they even seem backward.\n\nBut their stories are somehow evergreen, as the 2011 Broadway revival of \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and the 2014 HBO film made clear. (The stage version starred Mantello and the film was directed by Murphy; the two are clearly the doyens of the gay canonic renaissance.) It\u2019s not just that these productions happened, though it\u2019s part of the deal for a canonical play to be reproducible. The 2017 revival of \u201cTorch Song\u201d (as its title is now rendered) is transferring to Broadway in the fall. \u201cJeffrey,\u201d too, may be theater hunting; a recent reading starring Urie and Russell Tovey was in part an experiment to see how it lands today.\n\nThe deeper reason this material holds up despite being so tied to its times is that gayness, even now, does not operate as other minority identities do. Gay people are not usually raised in gay families, the way Jews are raised in Jewish ones, and blacks in black ones; gays have to invent their identity from scratch in every generation. And even if there were a healthy tradition of mentorship by gay elders, the population of gay elders \u2014 the ones who would now be in their 60s and 70s \u2014 was decimated by AIDS. So whatever advances have been made in supportive parenting, the process by which a gay man finds himself and his people is much the same as it ever was: Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Or to put it more gaily, you are what we were.\n\nFor Murphy, such intellectual workarounds are unnecessary; he finds \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d forward-thinking whether or not you consider that it was written in a time when \u201cyou could literally be arrested\u201d for being gay. \u201cEverything discussed in it\u201d \u2014 hatred, self-hatred, debates about monogamy \u2014 \u201cis happening now,\u201d he says. Nor has gay style gone out of style. \u201cI defy you to tell me the difference between \u2018Oh, Mary, don\u2019t ask,\u2019 and \u2018Yaaas Kween,\u2019 \u201d Mantello says. \u201cAnd to pretend that shame does not exist because of all the strides of the past years just seems unrealistic.\u201d\n\nThe persistence of gay shame, an element of all these plays, is certainly troubling, yet I wonder if what we\u2019re seeing today is really the same thing. Maybe gay shame is itself being appropriated, or merging with the common human shame that writers have been anatomizing since Adam and Eve. That would explain why the canonical gay plays have always spoken to nongay audiences, and why today, when other forms of marginalization are so pressing, they speak more urgently, not less. Is gay history so far past that it now passes for everyone\u2019s?\n\nImage A 1970 promotional image for the film. Credit National General / Photofest\n\nToo soon to tell. It\u2019s hardly been more than a decade, Murphy says, since he got notes nixing gay characters on his TV shows. \u201cAre we really so much better off than we were 50 years ago?\u201d\n\nIf not, it may be time for a new canon. The one I\u2019ve sketched ended in 1993. Yours may include such fine gay plays as \u201cBent,\u201d \u201cThe Laramie Project,\u201d \u201cAs Is,\u201d \u201cFifth of July,\u201d \u201cThe Dying Gaul,\u201d \u201cTake Me Out,\u201d \u201cLove! Valour! Compassion!\u201d and the musical \u201cFalsettos.\u201d Or you might include works by and about women, from \u201cLast Summer at Bluefish Cove\u201d by Jane Chambers to the musical \u201cFun Home\u201d by Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori, based on Alison Bechdel\u2019s graphic novel, to Paula Vogel\u2019s \u201cIndecent.\u201d What gives me pause when I look at my own list of gay male playwrights is not their gender or generation; it\u2019s that all of them are white, and all but Crowley Jewish. It\u2019s perhaps too easy to say that these are the demographics that had access to the microphone, and that revisiting this in a few years will produce different results, as others succeed in scratching out the opportunities that gave Kushner and Kramer their platforms.\n\nBut great plays arise from something even great playwrights cannot control: great catastrophes. They may be political, social, medical or even personal \u2014 though if personal then personal in a way that anticipates the zeitgeist. White gay men of the type who write popular plays have few specifically gay disasters left to mine; a windfall, no doubt, for their well-being but not for the theater. Luckinbill, reflecting on \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d has said that the \u201cgreat truth\u201d of the play is that \u201cgay people are ordinary.\u201d But that insight can only be mind-blowing once.\n\nThe gay plays I\u2019ve been seeing more recently are variously charming, sexy, provocative and beautifully crafted. Sometimes, as in the 2015 comedies \u201cSteve\u201d by Mark Gerrard and \u201cDada Woof Papa Hot\u201d by Peter Parnell, they deal with timely subjects \u2014 parenting, aging \u2014 that, for me anyway, hit close to home. But issues like these are a bit baggy for great drama, and plays that question the homonormative movement (like Drew Droege\u2019s hilarious 2016 anti-marriage screed \u201cBright Colors and Bold Patterns\u201d) seem destined for a short shelf life. Even Crowley\u2019s 2002 sequel to \u201cBoys in the Band,\u201d almost inevitably titled \u201cThe Men From the Boys,\u201d washes up on the rocks of maturity. Three of the \u201cboys\u201d are in A.A. now.\n\nThe palette of these works is grayer, more tasteful. Sometimes, to judge from what\u2019s onstage, I have to conclude that Crate & Barrel is sponsoring the new gay agenda. And whether such plays even qualify as gay depends on your definition of \u201cgay plays.\u201d (An old theater joke says they are plays that have sex with other plays.) Presumably a gay play is defined in part by its focus on gay characters and gay life, but it is more than that, too. A gay play has a gay voice \u2014 one that may now be disappearing along with its literal cognate: the lisping, purse-lipped, tooth-sucking caricature bequeathed to us by the likes of Liberace and Paul Lynde. A play\u2019s gay voice, though, is more than just inflection; it\u2019s fundamental. It\u2019s quick-witted, protean, emotional. In the way only formerly suppressed things can be, it insists on largeness. The largeness may be conceptual or political or literal; \u201cAngels\u201d weighs in somewhere between seven and eight hours. Great gay plays are large because the fight they dramatize is about more than diapers, weddings or credenzas. In \u201cAngels\u201d and \u201cThe Normal Heart,\u201d the characters are fighting for their lives. In \u201cJeffrey,\u201d terror is the enemy. \u201cTorch Song\u201d and \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d wage a war for dignity. Goulash or lasagna, these are five-course meals.\n\nCan it be that \u201cAngels\u201d \u2014 the play that proclaims \u201cThe great work begins!\u201d \u2014 is actually the end of the line? After 25 years without a similarly thundering new entry into the canon, it may be time to recognize that the spotlight is moving on. As if turning Kauffmann\u2019s 1966 essay on its head, many of the best young gay male playwrights \u2014 Stephen Karam, Jordan Harrison, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins \u2014 no longer write about gay people anyway, or write about them only peripherally. Adam Bock\u2019s \u201cA Life,\u201d produced Off Broadway in 2016, is a terrific, terrifying fantasia on the afterlife whose main character merely happens to be gay.\n\nImage\n\n\n\nFrom left: Quinto in a Giorgio Armani sweater, $825, On the Cover | The cast of \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d is featured in T\u2019s March 4 Men\u2019s Style issue.From left: Quinto in a Giorgio Armani sweater, $825, armani.com , Scotch & Soda jeans, $165, scotch-soda.com , and Adidas Originals sneakers, $75, adidas.com .

Styled by Jay Massacret\n\nThat\u2019s fine; it means that playwrights representing other backgrounds and other letters in the LGBTQ coalition may get a shot at the culture\u2019s widest attention. When Tarell Alvin McCraney\u2019s \u201cChoir Boy\u201d opens in 2019 at Manhattan Theatre Club, it will likely be the first black gay male play ever seen on Broadway. And Matthew Lopez\u2019s \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d starts performances in London this month. It is a homage, at least in size and two-part structure, to \u201cAngels\u201d but also to E.M. Forster\u2019s \u201cHowards End.\u201d If \u201cThe Inheritance\u201d hews to the Forsterian theme of nostalgia for a purposeful past, as its title suggests it may, it would be a very apt gay play for this particular moment.\n\nBut among new works I\u2019ve actually seen, the only gay \u2014 or, rather, queer \u2014 theater piece that rises to the level of those I\u2019ve beatified is Taylor Mac\u2019s \u201cA 24-Decade History of Popular Music,\u201d which premiered as a complete work at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn in 2016. And I\u2019ve only seen part of it; the dragtastic marathon nightclub act is 24 hours long. (I listened to the rest.) Miraculously, it combines Kushner\u2019s vision, Kramer\u2019s anger, Crowley\u2019s cattiness, Fierstein\u2019s warmth and Rudnick\u2019s wit (plus a whole lot else) into one subversive astonishment, forcibly making room in American history for all of those previously omitted. Its entire structure \u2014 the repurposing of popular songs from \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy\u201d to \u201cBorn to Run\u201d so they tell suppressed stories \u2014 suggests the idea that canons are meant to be hijacked.\n\nOn the other hand, Rudnick isn\u2019t finished with the old canon yet. He\u2019s working on an unabashedly gay play called \u201cBig Night,\u201d inspired by the 2016 murders at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. It\u2019s a comedy.\n\nHair by Jimmy Paul at Susan Price NYC. Hair assistants: Evanie Frausto, Felicia Burrows, Levi Monarch.

The fashion designer, who has been the creative director of Marni since 2016, was born near Sardinia and spent his first four years living on a wooden schooner with his parents, sailing around the Mediterranean. Next, they settled into a grand 16th-century villa in Genoa with three of Risso\u2019s grandparents and an ever-rotating cast of glamorous houseguests from abroad. \u201cMy family was extremely eclectic,\u201d says the 35-year-old, who, craving stability, \u201cescaped\u201d at 16 to study fashion at the Polimoda school in Florence before attending the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and Central Saint Martins in London. \u201cIt was a vertigo way of life \u2014 I was always outside my comfort zone,\u201d he says. \u201cThat forced me to be adventurous and open-minded.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Risso landed a job working on women\u2019s design and special projects for Prada, where he remained for eight years. Since taking the helm from Marni\u2019s founder, Consuelo Castiglioni, who started the label in 1994, he\u2019s upheld the Milanese house\u2019s reputation for explosive floral prints and prim but off-kilter silhouettes. But he has also added his own diverse aesthetic, informed by everything from Disney cartoons to 18th-century tartan hunting jackets. \u201cI\u2019m driven by a concept I call \u2018retrovolution,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking everything you\u2019ve learned in the past about tradition and moving beyond it.\u201d", "keywords": ["womens", "director", "zone", "york", "wooden", "working", "way", "rissos", "play", "keen", "youve", "creative", "sense", "taking", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.15380591630591633, "subjectivity": 0.4782948532948532},

Both solo musicians at the time, they quickly realized they shared a love of rap and tattoos. (The two are very well inked.) Their friendship inevitably led to the recording studio, where they made their first album as Yurufuwa Gang, \u201cMars Ice House,\u201d which came out last April. Just as their look borrows from many sources \u2014 including \u201950s Americana and \u201980s-era hip-hop culture \u2014 their music is equally uncategorizable, moving from candyish pop to \u201990s slow jams. \u201cWe don\u2019t think a lot about what other artists are doing; we\u2019re focused on different things,\u201d Ishida says.

{"title": "\n                    Inside a Parisian Sculptor\u2019s World of Wonders                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/t-magazine/art/philippe-anthonioz-paris-sculptor.html", "text": "Photo\n\nPhysically, the Parisian sculptor and furniture-maker Philippe Anthonioz works from a studio near the Bastille in the bohemian 11th Arrondissement, but metaphorically, he also works in a shadow: His father, Bernard, son of the sculptor Charles Anthonioz, was an official in the administration of Andr\u00e9 Malraux, the novelist whom Charles de Gaulle named Minister of Cultural Affairs; his mother, Genevi\u00e8ve, was de Gaulle\u2019s niece and a legendary Resistance fighter.\n\nOver the course of his long career, the 64-year-old Anthonioz has had another distinguished association to transcend: Early in his career, in 1983, he began a two-year collaboration with the sculptor Diego Giacometti, then 80 and suffering from arthritis, to create furniture and fixtures for the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in the historic H\u00f4tel Sal\u00e9. While it was Giacometti who conceived the whimsical bronze pieces dripping with tiny flora and fauna, it was Anthonioz who did most of the fabrication; his spidery chairs, benches and oversize resin chandeliers form a conceptual bridge between the building\u2019s 17th-century architecture and Picasso\u2019s slashing Modernism. \u201cI am proud of what we did, of course,\u201d Anthonioz says, recalling the generosity of the older artist, whom he had first met when he was 13 through his well-connected father. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be defined by that.\u201d\n\nThese days, Anthonioz \u2014 who mostly sculpts in wood and plaster that is often cast in bronze \u2014 is known for his large-scale, abstract public statuary and custom-made lighting and functional objects for architects including Joseph Dirand, the fashion designer Tomas Maier and the interiors brand Ralph Pucci, for which he makes a line of bronze torchieres. Since 1979, he has kept his main studio in Passage Saint Bernard, a two-block-long cobblestone street not far from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, Afi Nayo, a Togolese mixed-media artist.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen he moved in, the alley had been home to generations of the city\u2019s furniture-makers, restorers and ebonizers. For the first 15 years, he occupied the second floor of No. 17, a magnificent 18th-century wooden building that was torn down to make way for an apartment complex in the mid-1990s, part of a short-lived attempt by Paris officials to erect new housing. But Anthonioz, enamored of the neighborhood\u2019s gritty charm \u2014 he compares it to Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, back before the boutiques descended in the early aughts \u2014 remained, moving a few doors down to the 1,600-square-foot ground floor of another 18th-century building, one accessible through an aged oak door. \u201cIf there is no romance in the environment,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard to make good things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike the studios of many contemporary artists, which are often minimalist affairs, defiantly ahistorical, his is redolent of the past. The front is an art-book-filled office-cum-salon, with walls hung with antique mirrors and vintage photos, including one of Charles Baudelaire, his lodestar; the back is a workshop crowded with stone arms and torsos, piled alongside pieces of old chandeliers used to construct limited-edition light fixtures for spaces like Loulou, the Dirand-designed restaurant in Paris\u2019s Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Frosted with fine plaster dust, the space itself seems sepia-toned, like a Eug\u00e8ne Atget photograph.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Anthonioz and Giacometti shared the belief that there should be no dividing line between decoration and fine art, their aesthetics diverged radically. Giacometti was obsessed with figuration and the natural world \u2014 he spent hours studying birds in the city\u2019s Jardin des Plantes, where Henri Rousseau had once found inspiration \u2014 but Anthonioz has always been driven by abstraction. Giacometti was a master of affixing tiny animals and curling leaves to the bronze framework of his designs, lending them a fey quality; Anthonioz eschews ornament, preferring sleek minimalist shapes. \u201cPeople always speak of me in the same breath as Diego, but I think of Carlo Scarpa, David Smith or even the Bauhaus,\u201d he says.\n\nIndeed, his sculptures have become increasingly monumental in recent years \u2014 the eight-foot-tall \u201cLa M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e,\u201d a cast-bronze totem, was installed in Pratt Institute\u2019s Brooklyn sculpture garden in 2016 \u2014 so he now works part-time in a lofty second studio in Ivry-sur-Seine, a southeastern suburb. He is also restoring an 18th-century farmhouse in the south, near Aix-en-Provence, where he plans to make work in his later years, in a barn he\u2019s converting into a studio. There, he hopes his five grown children will bring their own kids to run in the fields. \u201cMy work has gotten more abstract, maybe even more modern, as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a dog on a leash \u2014 not in what I create, and not in how I live my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["works", "charles", "sculptor", "work", "sculptors", "parisian", "inside", "studio", "18thcentury", "tiny", "world", "wonders", "giacometti", "anthonioz", "bronze"], "polarity": 0.1389933820968304, "subjectivity": 0.38793414439966156}
