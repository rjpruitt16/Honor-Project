But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: the couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said \u2018yes,\u2019 because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th birthday party for his new fianc\u00e9e, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward...[I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond and pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown and black girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters, and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation, his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown, with a deep-v neckline and blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, The bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit. The color also played well off of the rose gold of Iman\u2019s engagement and wedding rings, which is her favorite metal and the only one she wears\u2014even the chairs in the reception ballroom were rose gold!\n\nWith friends Chrissy Teigen, Tiffany Haddish and Gabrielle Union in attendance\u2014and yes, that\u2019s Odell Beckham in the wedding party; Iman and Shepard met at one of his parties\u2014this truly looked like the wedding of the year. If you didn\u2019t get your fill of the gorgeous evening here, Brides magazine has even more of the Shepards\u2019 special day, but for now, let\u2019s just say congrats to the happy couple!", "keywords": ["marriage", "iman", "wedding", "really", "look", "shows", "party", "model", "chanel", "say", "supermodels", "gown", "love", "shepard", "bride", "murad"], "polarity": 0.2825008507574297, "subjectivity": 0.5849510504115768},

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

Coincidentally, that year, the Academy Awards themed their ceremony \u201cOscar Celebrates Women and the Movies,\u201d putting their own spin on what the media was calling \u201cthe Year of the Woman,\u201d which began in 1992 when a record-breaking number of women (four) were simultaneously elected to the U.S. Senate (including the first black woman, Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun).\n\nBeing a future actress (or so I thought at the time) and avid watcher of the Oscars, I remember clearly that year\u2019s ceremony, which opened with a photo of the (then) 67 living female Oscar winners\u2014with the sole black one, Whoopi Goldberg, posed in the center (for color, I guess)\u2014and a musical number choreographed to Kool & the Gang\u2019s \u201cLadies\u2019 Night\u201d by Debbie Allen.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Kevin Mazur (WireImage/Getty Images)\n\nBut despite supposedly celebrating women in the movies, in his opening monologue, even Oscars host Billy Crystal had to concede that 1993 wasn\u2019t a particularly great year for women\u2019s roles in film. Twenty-five years later, the 90th Academy Awards\u2014with a major assist from best actress winner Frances McDormand\u2014proved that representation and respect are still major issues for women in Hollywood, as also evidenced by the rise of the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements.\n\nThough they have admittedly improved since 1993, outside of the two gender-specific acting categories, this year\u2019s Academy Awards could still only boast 47 women out of 198 nominees, contending in 17 of 20 categories. Only four won, and notably, Greta Gerwig\u2019s directorial nomination was the first nod to a female director since Kathryn Bigelow won for The Hurt Locker eight years ago, making Gerwig only the fifth to ever be nominated. (Fun fact: Despite director Dee Rees\u2019 incredible work on Mudbound, there still has yet to be a woman of color nominated for the directorial prize, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated in a writing category.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo outside of the acting categories, where were women truly the big winners Sunday night? In the commercial breaks, where several ads captured female imagination, influence and ingenuity. The three standouts of the night came courtesy of Nike, Twitter and Walmart, all heavily featuring women of color\u2014black women in particular.\n\nNike came through with a poignant and powerful 30-second spot titled \u201cUntil We All Win,\u201d featuring Serena Williams, who officially returns to competitive singles\u2019 tennis this week at the PNB Paribas Open, six months after giving birth. In a voiceover, Williams pointedly addresses her critics, characterization as an \u201cangry black woman,\u201d and the racism, colorism and sexism she has faced despite being one of the world\u2019s premiere athletes, saying:\n\nI\u2019ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized and overconfident. Too mean if I don\u2019t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I am proving, time and time again, there\u2019s no wrong way to be a woman.\n\nThe spot was effective and surprisingly emotional, given its brevity. Athletes or not, black women everywhere undoubtedly related to Williams\u2019 message and experiences\u2014at least, I know I did. But as Williams told Adweek, part of her impetus for doing the commercial was her infant daughter, Alexis:\n\nI want my daughter to be truthful and honest, strong and powerful; to realize that she can impact those around her. I want her to grow up knowing a woman\u2019s voice is extremely powerful. As females, we need to continue to be loud and make sure we are heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one of the major standouts of Oscar-night advertising was Twitter\u2019s #HereWeAre spot, featuring a cast of famous and not-so-famous women of varying types, races and abilities, including Issa Rae, Ava DuVernay and filmmakers Julie Dash and Jennifer Brea. Over a poem penned and performed by \u201cNuyoJewricanqueer\u201d poet Denice Frohman, the spot begins: \u201cI heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission. Then every word out her mouth, a riot ... \u201d\n\nBut however impactful Twitter\u2019s women-centric message, it also struck many as deeply hypocritical given the company\u2019s ongoing ineffectiveness and seeming reluctance to stop online harassment on its platform, most of which is directed at female users. Since comedian Leslie Jones famously went public in 2016 with evidence of the horrific abuse she suffered on Twitter after appearing in the all-female reboot of Ghostbusters, the social media company has done little to ensure the safety of its users, much to the chagrin of those who still experience abuse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s really no surprise that women were the target audience of Academy Awards advertisers. Despite composing a meager 26 percent of nominees, the Oscar audience (which reached a record low this year) is traditionally over 60 percent female. And according to a 2015 Fortune article, women are also considered \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful consumers,\u201d expected to reach a projected $18 trillion in global spending this year (pdf).\n\nBlack women make up 14 percent of American women, and as indicated by the 2017 Nielsen report \u201cAfrican-American Women: Our Science, Her Magic,\u201d our brand loyalty is specifically driving black spending power and (finally) garnering us acknowledgment as key influencers in the mainstream.\n\nSo while it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of the commercials broadcast on Oscar night were targeted toward women, it\u2019s also no surprise that black women were featured more heavily than in years past. For instance, although Mudbound did not win any of the four categories it was nominated for, director Dee Rees still emerged a winner last Sunday, both appearing in an ad for Samsung imploring viewers to \u201cmake something\u201d and further stoking the Afrofuturist imagination with a spot for Walmart, one of three one-minute commercials the big-box brand commissioned from female directors for Oscar night 2018, themed around the ubiquitous Walmart blue box.\n\nIn the spot, Rees delivers us an all-black, all-female cast\u2014including what appears to be a same-sex couple as parents\u2014featuring two-time 2018 Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige and shot by Mudbound and Black Panther cinematographer Rachel Morrison (also a nominee this year). Though the ad featured an intergalactic theme, it was ultimately a down-to-earth and normalizing take on a black family, as well as a timely addition to the wave of black-helmed sci-fi narratives currently in our midst. Most important, it was extremely well received by viewers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut despite Oscar advertisers\u2019 clear understanding of the power of the female dollar, whether that actually translates into tangible female power remains to seen\u2014especially at the Oscars. It would certainly be nice to see black women winning more than few and far-between supporting actress awards.\n\nY\u2019all little ads were cute, though.", "keywords": ["williams", "female", "hereweare", "woman", "black", "despite", "oscar", "rees", "night", "women", "spot", "marketable"], "polarity": 0.10675670268107246, "subjectivity": 0.482300586901427},

From his bold suit choices to his beauty routine, Kaluuya has emerged a real red-carpet winner.\n\nKaluuya quickly became one of my red-carpet faves because of his love for strong suit colors\u2014not shying away from burgundies and interesting, unexpected textures and necklines. His Oscars outfit, styled by Mercedes Natalia, was another standout, featuring a nontraditional, caramel-colored velvet Brunello Cucinelli contrast-collar tux jacket that looked beautiful against his skin. Hello, \u201cPosh Kenneth\u201d\u2014except this time, the poshness is real as all get-out.\n\nAnd here\u2019s yet another reason to love you some Kaluuya: He\u2019s a Fenty beauty fan.\n\nThanks to his groomer, Amber Amos, Kaluuya nailed that \u201clit from within\u201d glow on Oscar night that so many aspire to. And the realization that Kaluuya was rocking Fenty (the Pro Filt\u2019r foundation in 480 and 490, to be exact) collectively blew Twitter\u2019s mind.\n\nOne Twitter user asked Amos which setting powder she used for Kaluuya\u2019s face, to which the makeup artist replied, \u201cno setting powder babe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then Beauty Twitter\u2019s wigs flew to China.\n\nBecause, as you might remember, Kaluuya full-on embraced director Jordan Peele following his win for Best Original Screenplay, and nary a smudge of transfer was to be found on Peele\u2019s WHITE TUX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m nearly as excited watching that GIF as I was seeing Peele win, to be honest.\n\nAmos, who has been working with the very busy Kaluuya since October 2017, gave Billboard the lowdown on how she gave Kaluuya that natural-looking, nontransferring glow: \u201cThe most important part is skin prep and making sure his skin is very hydrated because realistically most guys aren\u2019t prepping their skin and they don\u2019t really have a routine,\u201d Amos said. \u201cDaniel is so low-key, every time the goal is to perfect the skin and make him look less tired than he is because he\u2019s doing a lot.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the complete routine, which takes about 30 minutes, from Billboard:\n\nAmos first applies a hydrating Lip & Body Treatment Balm from Paula\u2019s Choice, then cleanses and refreshes his skin with their go-to product, Kiehl\u2019s Oil-Free Toner, and then she lightly exfoliates Kaluuya\u2019s complexion with Kate Sommerville\u2019s Clinic to Go Resurfacing Peel Pads. After applying Kiehl\u2019s Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer, to help tighten the under eye area and get rid of any potential puffiness, Amos uses Kate Somerville\u2019s DermalQuench Liquid Lift, which is similar to a mini oxygen facial, to push both oxygen and hyaluronic acids into his skin. \u201cIt gives a nice boost, and makes sure the skin is plump yet firm and helps lighten dryness from the California air,\u201d she adds. Next up is more hydration in the form of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator 24 Hour Anti-Shine Moisturizer, followed up by a quick sweep of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty Pro Filt\u2019r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation (a mix of the shades 480 and 490) using Stila\u2019s One Step Complexion brush #33. Topping off his shine-free look is a mist of Kiehl\u2019s Men\u2019s Oil Eliminator Refreshing Shine Control Spray Toner, followed up with Beautyblender\u2019s blotterazzi reusable shine-eliminating sponge.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt should be noted that this isn\u2019t the first time Kaluuya has rocked Rihanna\u2019s beloved makeup brand on the red carpet. Amos blessed his complexion with Fenty for the SAG Awards, too.\n\nOne final tip that anyone can use for an instant lift: Amos completed the look by brushing Kaluuya\u2019s eyebrows upward using a clear brow gel. \u201cA down-shaped eyebrow makes you look weird and angry,\u201d Amos explained. \u201cThe gel makes it stay in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there you have it: Kaluuya, critically acclaimed actor, rising Hollywood star and, also, makeup goals.", "keywords": ["kaluuya", "skin", "flawless", "beauty", "kiehls", "shows", "fenty", "routine", "fellas", "kaluuyas", "makeup", "amos", "glow", "daniel", "look", "makes"], "polarity": 0.26958333333333334, "subjectivity": 0.5407936507936507},

I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role. (Watson is a perfectly capable actress, just #NotMyBelle.)\n\n\n\nLuckily for all of us, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s star has only continued to rise, with British Vogue now hailing her as Britain\u2019s \u201cbreakout star\u201d on its April cover. The 34-year-old actress graces the top fashion magazine looking like a red-velvet dream.\n\nPhoto: Mikael Jansson (Vogue UK/Cond\u00e9 Nast)\n\nMbatha-Raw lands the cover amid a publicity blitz for A Wrinkle in Time, the Ava DuVernay-helmed adaptation of the children\u2019s literary classic of the same name. In the film, Mbatha-Raw plays Dr. Kate Murry, mother to tween Meg Murry (Storm Reid), who embarks on an epic journey to find her father, Alex, played by Chris Pine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recent Vogue buzz notes, Mbatha-Raw has been \u201cescaping archetypes and quietly shaping a diverse CV for years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given riveting performances on both movie and TV screens, playing the title role in the period biopic Belle; showing off her singing skills as a troubled rock star in Beyond the Lights; and taking a time-traveling turn in the iconic, Emmy Award-winning \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror (which seemed to serve as inspiration for Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s latest video, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d). Mbatha-Raw even manages to be captivating in Netflix\u2019s less-than-stellar recent release, The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nAnd on the red carpet, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s sartorial growth has been equally impressive. This recent slideshow from Vogue UK tracks Mbatha-Raw\u2019s maturation as she settles into more streamlined, polished shapes with bold colors and textures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly feels like Mbatha-Raw is coming into her moment, though she\u2019s been patiently building her career for decades, starting, as many Brits do, on the stage.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, you have power over your performance, but no power over the distribution or timetable,\u201d she recently told Refinery 29. \u201cSo it just so happens this is all coming out at the same time. But I guess I should embrace the ride!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbatha-Raw also talked about the power of seemingly innocuous beauty choices, like how to wear her hair on-screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play a woman and not have race be the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will always bring who I am to the story and make sure my ethnicity is celebrated on-screen. I\u2019m not afraid to have those tough conversations with directors about how I represent myself. Hair, for instance, sounds like a superficial conversation. But images remain in our subconscious. So when it comes to representing on-screen, I can use my hair to send the important message to girls everywhere that they can be who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: British Vogue\u2019s April issue, featuring Mbatha-Raw\u2019s cover and interview, is available on newsstands Friday, March 9.

Blige after the 2018 Oscars, and apparently, my invitation was lost in the mail ... or maybe it was the huge snowstorm that hit the East Coast this weekend that caused the delay. It was a balmy 69 degrees where I live, but there must be a reason I didn\u2019t get an invite. Probably the Mueller investigation.\n\nAnyway, Us Weekly reports that Hov and Queen Bey turned the garage at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles into an old-school Hollywood glamour lounge for around 150 guests who were sworn to secrecy, which upsets me even more, because I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Chateau Marmont.\n\nHonestly, I have no clue what the Chateau Marmont is, but had my invitation not been stolen by kids in the neighborhood, I could have found out. (Just so I won\u2019t get in trouble here, I think I might have dated Chateau Marmont Wilkins during my sophomore year in college, but those years are pretty fuzzy.)\n\nThe party was so secret, Mary J. Blige had to throw people off the scent. When asked on the red carpet if she was doing anything to celebrate her Oscar nomination, the R&B diva told Entertainment Tonight: \u201cThe fam is doing something big for us tonight. I feel really blessed to have people that care about me that much. I care about them that much, and it just feels really good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Page Six, the guests had to walk up a hill, go into a kitchen and enter a secret walkway that took them to the party. The guests didn\u2019t even know who was throwing the party, as the staff was told to refer to Jigga and Sasha Fierce only as \u201cthe host and hostess,\u201d which makes me feel better because If I was invited to a party by an anonymous stranger, I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t go. I\u2019d assume it was \u201cthe feds\u201d or the infamous \u201cthey.\u201d I don\u2019t even know who \u201cthey\u201d are. All I know is that \u201cthey\u201d work closely with the feds and \u201cthem people\u201d in the Department of Shit Black People Don\u2019t Fuck With.\n\n\u201cAll of black Hollywood was there,\u201d according to one source. They inadvertently cut off the part of the sentence that said \u201cexcept for Michael Harriot,\u201d but you know how \u201cthey\u201d do.\n\nNo press or photographers were invited, but a few pictures managed to leak, including this one of Dave Chapelle, Jordan Peele, Jay-Z, Kobe Bryant and Anthony Anderson:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am told that Dave Chapelle was whispering to Peele: \u201cHave you seen Mike Harriot? I know he\u2019s here somewhere. There\u2019s no way he wasn\u2019t invited!\u201d\n\nAlso, notice that the bar in the background is stocked with Jay\u2019s Armand de Brignac Champagne because you don\u2019t reach $800 million in net worth by passing up branding opportunities. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what he would have told me during our little private chat in the VIP section as Beyonc\u00e9 told me to come out to the house one weekend to see the kids, and I told her I was very busy this time of year but that I\u2019d try to make it out in the fall.\n\nThen she would have told me to bring Chateau out with me, and she would have looked all sad when I told her that Chateau and I broke up years ago. Then Bey would have reached out to rub me on my shoulders, looked wistfully into my eyes and said: \u201cI thought you two were going to make it. I really did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCelebrities like Stevie Wonder, Rihanna, Danai Gurira, Drake and Jamie Foxx were all left wondering where Michael Harriot was as I eschewed expensive Champagne for a plastic Solo cup filled from my refrigerator\u2019s water dispenser before going to bed at the Chateau Harri\u00f3t.\n\nBut the word is that this will become an annual event for the Carters, so I suspect I\u2019ll be there next year ...\n\nWeather permitting.", "keywords": ["know", "meant", "really", "im", "weekend", "oscars", "guests", "black", "told", "chateau", "party", "jayz", "dont", "secret", "sure", "invite", "beyonc\u00e9", "marmont", "harriot", "threw"], "polarity": 0.06304027113237641, "subjectivity": 0.5160380116959064},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["sheriff", "henson", "oscars", "taraji", "carpetagain", "kiss", "makeup", "used", "ashunta", "using", "glow", "tarajis", "lashes", "perfect", "p", "slays", "red"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["know", "shadow", "getty", "hair", "oscars", "simply", "eye", "palette", "stunning", "served", "glow", "glamour", "night", "zendaya", "look"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite? Seeing Janet Mock, Patrisse Kahn-Cullors and Tarana Burke in the spotlight among an array of activists featured in Common and Andra Day\u2019s performance of their nominated song, \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d from Marshall.\n\nBut this is The Glow Up, so aside from waiting to see if our faves would win, we fixed our collective gaze on the red carpet.

One of the best parts of Oscar night is the \u00fcber-exclusive annual Vanity Fair after-party, and our folks were out in force, giving us a bonus round of big fashion moments (minus one blue vest that felt a bit out of place amid all that glamour\u2014#SorryNotSorry).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was truly a night full of stars\u2014and they were outspoken and in full effect.

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["unmaking", "talks", "lawrence", "j", "hair", "soul", "hairstylist", "netflix", "natural", "queen", "florence", "mudbound", "davis", "hiphop", "beautiful", "mary", "blige"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director.

The afternoon\u2019s honors went to actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish; actress and writer Danai Gurira; Emmy Award-winning writer, director and actress Lena Waithe; and actress and activist Tessa Thompson.\n\nWaithe was honored with the Ford Vanguard Award and used her acceptance speech to proclaim her love for fiancee Alana Mayo, saying, \u201cWho knew that in 2018 that would still be considered a revolutionary act?\u201d She went on to encourage her closeted colleagues who are \u201cstill hiding\u201d to stay true to themselves, saying in part:\n\n[We\u2019re] hiding because we don\u2019t want to lose an endorsement deal. Hiding because they want to be \u201cnormal.\u201d Hiding because we don\u2019t want to make white folks uneasy. But most of all, hiding because we don\u2019t want to make our own people uncomfortable. ... Being born gay, black and female is not a revolutionary act. Being proud to be a gay black female is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaithe\u2019s powerful message reportedly garnered loud applause from the audience of luminaries as she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just my job to make art ... but to be a shining light for all the little lesbians in training. To care about them more than my bank account.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Gurira also spoke about understanding her increased visibility and impact on younger generations since her standout role as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther, saying:\n\nThis journey has led me many a time to the presence of young people. .... Young people who look at me to give them something to hold onto, that special nugget that just may help them get through. And, I realized that sometimes I forget what it was like to be that young, to struggle in your own skin that much. To grapple with a world system that was clearly not made for us in mind. To be unsure of your place in this realm, of how you will ever find it or how you will ever like yourself, let alone love yourself. ... We\u2019ve been lied to and our youth are struggling with those lies, drowning in them. Being denied their greatness because there are so many lies standing between them and their true selves.

My neighborhood has a Walk Score of 92. The best nightlife Hollywood has to offer and the famous Walk of Fame are just minutes away from my front door.\n\nMy building is an older one in a premium location, and my apartment was completely gutted and refurbished the month before I moved in. It has a picture window, beautiful, dark laminate floors, a full-sized kitchen with stainless steel appliances, an enormous closet for all my clothing, shoes and purses, and a beautiful vanity area with a built-in makeup mirror that I love.\n\nIt has a breakfast bar and a built-in wine rack, and enough space in the open floor plan to fit my queen-sized bed, my writing desk, two large bookcases, a tv stand and my sofa, which is seven-feet long. The rent, including my two parking spaces is just under $1500 a month. This part of Hollywood is under rent control, so my rent can never be raised more than 3 percent a year (pdf).\n\nThere are people out there paying a whole lot more for a whole lot less, and I would not want to trade places with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, the New York Times reports that there are adults in San Francisco paying $1400 - $2400 to live in dormitory-style units where they get a fully furnished 130-240 square foot bedroom with WiFi and utilities included. They share communal bathrooms and kitchens just like in college.\n\nExcept these are not college students. These are working adults who make from $40,000 to $90,000 a year and range in age from their early 20s to their early 50s.\n\nStarcity, the development company renting the units, offer premium services for additional fees such as a laundry service for $40 a month and room cleaning for $130 a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt sounds crazy, but the people interviewed by the Times say they love it, and it is a much easier situation than paying normal San Francisco rents, where one-bedroom apartments go for an average of $3,300 a month.\n\nIn New York City, WeWork \u2014 the popular co-working space company \u2014 now has WeLive, through which it rents fully-furnished studio apartments for $3,250 a month plus utilities.\n\nStarcity currently has three properties with 36 units open. It has plans to open nine more, and the company\u2019s waiting list already has 8,000 people on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine being on a waiting list to pay that much rent and having to share a bathroom.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m thankful for my rent-controlled apartment in Hollywood.

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman. You can read her entire interview online at Porter Edit, alongside a gorgeous\u2014and very sexy\u2014editorial.\n\n", "keywords": ["sexual", "edit", "roles", "forward", "hollywood", "viola", "way", "certain", "gets", "mirroring", "porter", "pay", "davis", "real", "women", "look"], "polarity": 0.17628166160081052, "subjectivity": 0.47495226404800867},

This ain\u2019t no drill.\n\nTariq Nasheed, the heralded filmmaker of the semi-factual Hidden Colors film series, who wields his Twitter account like a medieval mace to smash white supremacy, critical thinkers and any \u201cbed wench\u201d who dares to take ownership of her vagina and not subject it to the will of ashy niggas who refer to her as a \u201cqueen,\u201d has announced his new career as an R&B singer from 1989.\n\nThose familiar with Nasheed know that he began his career as a pimp-adjacent dating guru known as \u201cKing Flex,\u201d instructing thirsty men on the art of tapping into their inner pussy predator. He soon transformed himself into a documentarian by chronicling the shenanigans of the leading charlatans in the black community, paving the way for some of the most popular imaginary institutions in Black America like the Boyce Watkins Bullshit School for Bitcoins and Dr. Umar\u2019s Hotep Academy for Straight Black Boy Magic that is currently looking at purchasing a property on the outskirts of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, disenchanted with his snub at the 2018 Academy Awards, Tariq Elite has embarked on a new career in the lucrative field of shucking and jiving. His new video combines the style of the band at Miami-Dade County High School\u2019s 1992 Senior Prom with music from the band The Time (if Morris Day had a stroke and the band replaced him with someone else who had a worse stroke but also had less musical talent).\n\nReminiscent of the #11 video from BET\u2019s Video Soul weekly countdown (It doesn\u2019t matter which week, they\u2019re all the same) \u201cMink Slide\u201d features King Flex sporting a variety of smoking jackets as he entertains light-skinned women in a nightclub backed by a Casio keyboard set on \u201cfunky white nonsense\u201d and a house band.\n\nBut the genius of the video is the stage performance. Wearing Jon Snow\u2019s coat from his time with the Night\u2019s Watch, Tariq does his best impression of Omarion (after he went solo). While he is no Oran \u201cJuice\u201d Jones, Tariq can actually carry a tune as he sings the poetically seductive lyrics:\n\nI see your legs. I see your hot bah-day.\n\nI want you to know, I came here to par-tay\n\nThere\u2019s only one who captured my eyes. It\u2019s you!\n\nSo what we gonna do?

Abort!\n\nDue to the lateness of our discovery of this video, we were unable to confirm the amount that Tariq sold his soul for, but from the quality of the video, we estimate his price for stepping and fetching to be somewhere between a month\u2019s tuition at The Watkins School for Economic Tomfoolery (featuring Charles Wu) and the amount in Umar Johnson\u2019s Gofundme account.\n\nFor more information, or to book Tariq Nasheed for a private shuck and jive performance, contact W.H.A.T.D.F.U.C.C. on our nonexistent website, or ask the next dude with level 5 ashiness who refers to you as a \u201cwombman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.", "keywords": ["sisqo", "white", "goes", "know", "man", "soul", "tariq", "nasheed", "career", "black", "hotepocalypse", "king", "video"], "polarity": 0.06347866419294991, "subjectivity": 0.39309814193742765},

Specifically, she wants me to take her vitamins, which is why a month\u2019s supply of multivitamins from her company, Movita Organics, sits on my desk. The glass bottle boasts that they are made with organic fruit, vegetables and herbs, whole-food vitamins and minerals, and are gluten-free, non-GMO and allergen-free for shellfish and nuts. But for me, the biggest selling point was that I could take them on an empty stomach, which I have been, every morning for the past two weeks.\n\nHow do I feel? Pretty damn good, for someone who averages five hours of sleep per night.\n\nI\u2019m guessing this proprietary blend must be where Tonya Lewis Lee gets the energy to keep so many balls in the air\u2014and look great doing it. After all, the attorney, film and television producer, writer, health advocate, public speaker, blogger and now vitamin entrepreneur is also mother to two grown children and has been married to prolific and legendary director Spike Lee since 1993.\n\nAnd Movita isn\u2019t even her only current project: Aside from her own writing projects, her production company, Tonik Productions, is currently in distribution talks for its critically acclaimed film Monster, which premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and stars Jeffrey Wright and Jennifer Hudson. It\u2019s just one of multiple film and television projects the company has pending; and then, of course, she\u2019s also executive producer (and rumored inspiration) for Netflix\u2019s successful serial reboot of her husband\u2019s first feature film, She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\n\nAdd to that her health-and-wellness blog, Healthy You Now, and her numerous speaking engagements around the country on issues of women\u2019s and infant health, and you\u2019ve got one very full, very multifaceted life. Here at The Glow Up, all we want to know is: How does she do it? Lewis Lee graciously took time out from her busy schedule to tell us:\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny, because I think sometimes for people it can sound like, \u201cOh, she has so many different things.\u201d But for me, they all come out of the same place, meaning that they come from a place of really wanting to ultimately tell stories around who we are as a people\u2014and particularly black people\u2014but also, black people living in an integrated world. And the health piece to me is so clear because I believe that we\u2019re all here for a purpose and a reason, and you can\u2019t really fulfill your purpose or your reason if you don\u2019t have your health. And so, for me, the vitamins are a way to continue the conversation with women around how to live your best life, how to be as healthy as you possibly can be, and to keep those conversations and stories going, as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee\u2019s recent venture into the vitamin market is part of advancing that conversation. Movita Organics launched with its women\u2019s multivitamin (which retails at a competitive $39.95 per bottle for a incomparable list of benefits), but has several other products ready for market, including a prenatal vitamin, B3 and B12, as well as a hair, skin and nails formulation we can\u2019t wait to get our hands on.\n\nBut if a high-end multivitamin seems a trivial pursuit in comparison with the real health crises facing our communities, Lewis Lee is well-versed on those issues as well, traveling the country to engage with and inform women of all backgrounds about ways to achieve optimal health for themselves, their families and their communities:\n\n\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve done when I have gone and spoken at different outlets is to bring together people from that particular community to talk about the issues; about what are the barriers to optimal health in their communities, and how can we seek to make the situation better? ... Because I do think that when you share information\u2014even if what\u2019s happening in my community is a little different [from] what\u2019s going on in yours\u2014that shared information can be helpful. Again, because it\u2019s not just an individual choice; it is about our community as well, and getting our communities to support healthy lifestyles, especially in this onslaught that we are dealing with our government right now. So I hope to go offline as well, and bring people together to have these conversations and try to make our communities as healthy as they can be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Keith Major\n\nNow that she\u2019s moving into making health-based products, Lewis Lee is garnering obvious comparisons to other lifestyle mavens\u2014her blog has even been called \u201cthe black Goop.\u201d But Lewis Lee is clear that her mission is to create and cultivate a healthy lifestyle culture made for us, by us:\n\n\n\nWhen I initially started my blog, Healthy You Now, the idea was to provide a platform that was creating content that would help women find answers and ... ways to live a better, healthier lifestyle. And we also were trying to create a community of women, because I think that a lot of times we feel like we\u2019re out here on our own, trying to figure these issues out. But when you hear other people\u2019s journeys, it\u2019s helpful to know that you\u2019re not alone ...\n\nIt is about a community of women with tools to help them live their best lives. And as women of color, we certainly deserve and need space for ourselves as well ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious undertaking, but clearly, Lewis Lee is no stranger to ambition. Neither is she the prototypical \u201cHollywood wife\u201d; even during the years she focused on raising her family in her native New York, she always kept her own career at what she calls a \u201csimmer.\u201d But while it would be easy to assume that she\u2019s gotta have it all, Lewis Lee chuckles at the concept:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m a believer that you can have it all, but not necessarily all at the same time. And it\u2019s hard; I am very fortunate in that I married someone who was able to provide while we were raising our children. I did keep working, but ... I made the choice that my children were going to come first, and I was able to work around what worked for them. [But] I always had a vision that by the time my son\u2014who\u2019s my youngest\u2014graduated from high school, I\u2019d still be a relatively young woman, and I could really go hard in my career. ... I was able to do that, and once they were out of the house, I was then able to shift gears and go really hard, which is really amazing. And I am so grateful to be able to be in that position. So I would say to women: You have to make choices that work for your family. You have to make your choices, but I do believe as women, no matter what your circumstances, you have to have something for yourself. And even if you have to keep it at simmer\u2014if you can\u2019t do it 100 percent\u2014you should do something so that when the time comes ... you can shift gears and go 100 percent... I think that for our own self-esteem, we do have to be engaged in working at something other than our children, so that when they do grow up\u2014and they do grow up faster than we think\u2014you\u2019ve got something for yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee credits great partnerships in every area of her life with her ability to juggle it all, as well as the ability to pivot when things aren\u2019t working out. But most of all, she thinks the secret to her ongoing motivation and success is figuring out what she loves to do, and continuing to do it:", "keywords": ["really", "able", "film", "lewis", "great", "motivator", "health", "multifaceted", "healthy", "vitamins", "lee", "women", "mama", "community", "tonya"], "polarity": 0.22339749536178108, "subjectivity": 0.5181294725682479},

I had come for a work event, and ended up with some extra time on my hands in the city.\n\nI should have been on a plane on my way back home to Los Angeles, but the way my airline was set up, they overbooked the flight and offered me a travel voucher plus a hotel room for the night if I took a flight the next day instead.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were having a light dinner and drinks at a bar in midtown. We\u2019d consumed plenty of tequila and were laughing and talking when I saw him out of the corner of my eye.\n\nYou can always tell when someone is sizing you up\u2014at least, I can. I could feel him looking at me even before I turned to see who it was. His silhouette was already commanding a presence in my peripheral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI turned, ever so slightly, to glance at him. He was looking right back at me. I flashed my cutest and slyest smize before returning my attention to my drink.\n\nIt worked.\n\nHe made his way over to us, and I pretended not to notice him as I laughed at something my friend said that wasn\u2019t even that funny. Corny, I know, but that worked, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe leaned toward me and said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nHis voice was deep and smooth. I turned toward him and took a good look at him.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said and gave him a once-over.\n\nTall\u2014over 6 feet. Thick, full beard. Bald head. Chocolate skin. A suit that looked like it was made specially for him. A matching pocket square and tie. Nice shoes. An air of confidence that was noticeable but not put on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had to come over here because I spotted you and that lipstick from all the way across the room,\u201d he said, smiling. His teeth were perfect.\n\nI smiled but said nothing.\n\nHe leaned a little closer, his voice lower this time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be funny, but you looking like a whole snack. Can I eat you?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI laughed and said \u201cSir\u201d loudly.\n\nMy girl laughed. He turned, unshaken, to look at her. He flashed a grin at her, then turned back toward me and looked expectantly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most expensive dish on the menu, sir,\u201d I said. My girl laughed again. This time, I joined her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout missing a beat, he said, \u201cIt ain\u2019t tricking if you got it.\u201d\n\nThe next giggle caught in my throat.\n\nListen. If you are quick on your feet with the witty comebacks, you are well on your way to winning with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had my attention.\n\nWe bantered back and forth for a few minutes. I signaled the bartender for my check as he flirted with me.\n\nHe was smooth, and the lines he came with after that first one were clever and flattering. He never took his eyes off me, even when his friend walked up and stood just off to the side of us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bartender put my check down, he immediately snatched it up.\n\n\u201cI got it,\u201d he said. He took out an American Express card and slipped it inside without even looking at the bill.\n\nMe and my girl looked at each other and smirked.\n\nIt was a player move. He wanted us to know that the amount of the bill was of no consequence to him; he carries no balances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see you, sir, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cWe can pay for our own check,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, please,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\nMore banter. As we talked, I had my phone in my hand because I was live-tweeting everything that was happening. In that moment, everything is funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAre you texting your boyfriend?\u201d he asked.\n\nI laughed and looked back at my girl again, who was giving me the look. She slowly rolled her eyes to the left, and I took in his homeboy for the first time.\n\nHe. Was. Not. Cute.\n\nMy girl could tell I was warming up to my guy, and she gave me the look, like, Bitch, you better not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Man had signed the bill and was already asking me what we were planning to do next.\n\nI made up some vague story about us having another spot to hit, and he continued smooth-talking me and my girl until we were convinced to go along with them to another bar, where we were joined by his brother.\n\nIn an effort to both give me and my girl a moment to ourselves and not look like a creep, he arranged for us to ride in two separate Lyfts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy girl was only slightly annoyed, but she warned me that if his brother wasn\u2019t cute, we were leaving the next bar as soon as we walked in.\n\nHis brother was very cute.\n\nWe hung out with the three of them until very late, drinking, laughing, listening to music and having a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Man and his brother invited us back to their hotel suite. It\u2019s clich\u00e9 and probably a little dangerous, but we went anyway because it was summertime in New York City; we were buzzed off of alcohol, laughter and good vibes; and the mood was right.\n\nWe started out sitting in the living area as a group, but slowly broke off into pairs.\n\nWe lay side by side on his bed talking about everything from my career as a writer to his lifestyle as a lawyer in Miami.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe massaged my scalp, gave me a back rub and played with my feet.\n\nI licked his lips, got high off of his scent and fell asleep with my face smushed into his chest.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t drool once, thankfully.\n\nThe next day, as we parted ways, we exchanged phone numbers.\n\nHe saved me as \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d in his phone.\n\nI saved him as \u201cHe Did That\u201d in mine\u2014because he did, in fact, do that.\n\nBut it would take an entirely new column just to explain how ...\n\n(To be continued next Friday)", "keywords": ["turned", "wasnt", "looking", "sir", "life", "took", "way", "looked", "laughed", "nonmonogamist", "incidents", "look", "serial", "girl"], "polarity": 0.15045436045436042, "subjectivity": 0.4349194324194323},

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["white", "mr", "shit", "movie", "magical", "negro", "charlie", "reasons", "mother", "magically", "negrod", "church", "does"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Viola and our team at JuVee are beyond excited to partner with Sony/TriStar to bring these fierce women to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while this sounds like a story that deserves to be told regardless of the black-ass blockbuster currently dominating the box office, the impact of Marvel\u2019s latest success isn\u2019t lost on Schulman, who issued this statement:\n\nBlack Panther just showed us how the power of imagination and lore could reveal a world without gender and racial stereotypes.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race.

I was a 14-year-old freshman at Loyola High School, a prestigious Jesuit all-boys school in Los Angeles built on the philosophy that rigorous academic training would produce the next generation of elite Catholic young men.\n\n\n\nKnown for its meat grinder academics, Loyola also had a complementary mission to train young men to have a social justice mindset, a \u201cMan for Others.\u201d We were to go out and change the world. Seems like a school perfectly matched to the philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr., right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, not at first.\n\nFor most of the school\u2019s life, the world that Loyola wanted to change was white, just like its student body and faculty. Around the mid-1970s, by the time the school opened its doors to more black and brown boys from throughout South Central and East L.A., it had recognized that African American and Latino communities needed to be served also. But still, when I entered Loyola, the school was around 90 percent white, both in students and faculty.\n\nFrom the point of view of the small group of black Loyola boys, we were invisible. Admitted for our academic chops, yes, but who also just happened to be damn fast on the football field and track, we were ignored in all things social. We had to fight for recognition of our clubs, to host dances with black Catholic girls\u2019 schools and to gain the rights any other student would have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the downside. The upside? We also knew that by attending Loyola, we were the direct beneficiaries of the Martin Luther King Jr. dream. As such, we wanted Loyola to recognize King\u2019s birthday, which had yet to be declared a federal holiday, as a school holiday.\n\nLoyola said no.\n\nSo we black boys did what we were supposed to do. We revolted.\n\nMost of our families migrated to Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s to escape the darkness of the Jim Crow South in order to bask in the golden-sunshine promise of western freedom. Now able to see the mountaintop, black families in Southern California took full advantage. Affirmative action opened previously closed doors in education and employment, turning sharecroppers who\u2019d pulled cotton in the dry, hot fields of Texas into shareholders of Texas Instruments. And they destroyed the racist housing covenants that kept blacks out of the previously white South Central neighborhoods like Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Ladera Heights, Windsor Hills and View Park. Having their sons admitted to the top academic school like Loyola was a cherry on top.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were living King\u2019s dream.\n\nThis didn\u2019t mean that every black Loyola boy was a natural ally. Most of us had grown up playing in Little League against one another, but there were definite class differences. Flatlanders, aka the boys who lived in South Central and Inglewood, versus the Hill Negroes, the ones with the Baldwin Hills views of downtown Los Angeles\u2014these were a definite class dividing line. It was Jack and Jill versus Jamal and Jamila. Those who took the Rapid Transit District bus, aka the Rough Tough and Dangerous, through Blood and Crip territory versus those who rode comfortably in their dad\u2019s classic Jag to the Dons.\n\nYet when it came to standing up for our own dignity, and the dignity of King, those black class barriers broke down and we stood arm in arm and marched in lockstep. We\u2019d fight together not only to get a King holiday but also to change the school itself. Not just for us, but also for future black Loyola boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaught by the Jesuits that our brains were our most powerful weapon, and the reason we\u2019d been admitted to the school in the first place, we pressured the Jesuits to listen to our arguments. We transformed our lunch from pickup basketball games to teach-ins around the philosophies of Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Dick Gregory and Malcolm X. We grew our facial hair, in direct violation of the strict Loyola dress code, as an act of nonviolent protest. This would get us JUG, or Justice Under God, as detention was known at the school, but still, the Jesuits didn\u2019t move.\n\nFinally, we decided to do something drastic. Instead of simply being absent on the day, the black students would show up on King\u2019s birthday wearing a white shirt, black pants and a simple black-tie uniform. The key? Stay silent in class when called upon by teachers as an act of nonviolent resistance. Today this may seem like a relatively benign act of defiance, since it didn\u2019t involve tearing something up or burning something down, but as a 14-year-old black boy still trying to understand that he held all the power in the universe to make change, it was amazing.\n\nLoyola is the oldest school in Southern California, with the traditions and stately brick buildings that come with that legacy. Intrinsic within Loyola was the notion that you as a student were extremely privileged to attend such an august institution, and as such, students needed to toe the line, or that opportunity could be taken away from you. In other words, when the Jesuits asked you to jump, you only asked how high after you were already in the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the teacher pointed to you and said, \u201cMr. Ross \u2026 ,\u201d you answered immediately. We didn\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t.\n\nOn that day on Jan. 15, 1981, the majority of the black students at Loyola (there are a few who didn\u2019t, and to this day, I can remember their names) sat in their seats and said nothing when called upon. It was an act of defiance that was unmistakable and, frankly, jarring to the Jesuits. And yet, understanding King\u2019s philosophy that said nonviolent change was revolutionary, we risked our spots at Loyola to create our own small revolution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter school, phone calls were made to our nervous parents, the ones who\u2019d risked so much to get us into that \u201cLie-Oh-La,\u201d and yet they didn\u2019t blink, either.\n\nWe didn\u2019t win that year. But we kept up the protests, the rhetoric, and finally the Jesuits broke. Loyola honored Martin Luther King Jr. as a school holiday in 1982, a year before President Ronald Reagan signed the federal holiday into law.\n\nThat was then, 36 years ago, when King\u2019s life and philosophy felt real and alive. Now we\u2019re approaching the 50th anniversary of his death, and King has been transformed into a stone figure, towering over the African-American community, but rarely understood correctly. For my Gen X compadres, many of us moved on from King, who in some ways became pass\u00e9 in comparison with the dynamic Malcolm X, and the burgeoning hip-hop culture that embodied his \u201cBy any means necessary\u201d philosophy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were living in a world where the crack was flowing, the bullets flying and the government lying, all to wage war on black and brown bodies in Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and, yes, South Central. Nonviolence? Not a goddamn chance. But for many white folks, and some black folks, the diminished legacy of King presented an opportunity.\n\nGiven a choice between the angry red pill of Malcolm X\u2019s \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d and the blue chill pill of King\u2019s nonviolence, white folks began swallowing handfuls of blue pills that created a gentrified MLK of \u201cWhat would King do?\u201d questions, and \u201ccolorblind society\u201d empty platitudes. In other words, white folks turned Martin Luther King Jr. into a Jedi mind trick of nothingness, stripping him of meaning, and turning his words and movement into a clich\u00e9.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as if they were alone. What was more genius was that they got some black folks to believe that \u201cnothingness\u201d definition of King. While we weren\u2019t looking, someone had injected a post-racial tumor into the brains of some black folks who turned a King movement dedicated to the \u201cus\u201d into a hollow narcissistic philosophy devoted to the \u201cme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese Negropeans, instead of feeling the responsibility of fighting the King fight to create a hand-up for those needing a come up, rejected the tangible connective tissue that binds us together as black people. In other words, they\u2019d sing Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d tribute as an ode to authentic blackness, heads swaying and all, without giving one nanosecond of understanding of the philosophy of the man for whom the song was written.\n\nI see it in social media spaces like Nextdoor and Facebook groups, especially those centered in the black Los Angeles areas of Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Ladera, View Park and Windsor Hills, the same places where my fellow Loyola classmates and I lived and fought to keep King\u2019s dream alive. They\u2019re now filled with the nouveau Negro riche who are more concerned with their paper property values than with the plight of the black poor for whom King marched. They spend their time aggrieved that the black poor inconveniently live within shouting distance of their emerald green lawns and mighty-whitey picket fences.\n\nWith their remote cameras, their transformation of crime into a fetish, and the almost pathological need to distinguish themselves from the poor, undereducated black other who have the temerity to walk down their sidewalks, it should come as no surprise that as these black middle-class communities became more and more gentrified by the privileged children of white flight, these beneficiaries of King enthusiastically joined these new interlopers in myopically misquoting King\u2019s \u201ccolorblind society\u201d as a justification for not noticing that African-American communities are being dissolved in irrevocable ways, all because yet another zero has been added to the worth of their house and a Whole Foods is rumored to be a-comin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs that how much King\u2019s dream is worth today?\n\nIn some ways, this is a natural progression as the struggle for social justice moves from consciousness to unconsciousness as the generations move away from the real King as a flesh-and-blood human rights revolutionary. Fifty years after his dead body was reduced to a Newsweek shock post, King has become a myth or a symbol. Nothing says your philosophy has become impotent more than when black folks think they can create social change through those symbols, but without the hard work. Most important, King as symbol has stripped away the empathy that comes with believing that the destinies of black people, whether rich or poor, are always and forever connected.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanging one\u2019s profile picture to say Black Lives Matter one day, only to counteract it the next day by parroting the white supremacist notion that blackness is an inherent moral deficit that causes \u201cblack-on-black crime,\u201d is a paradox that can\u2019t be aligned. However, it is what happens when you get the good education, the good job, and think that you made it because of your individual genius and pluck, but also because you think your property taxes are the true metric of your moral worth. A wealth that you believe gives you carte blanche to look down on the black working poor who rent, shower at night because of their dirty jobs and, yeah, like to talk shit on street corners with a tall can, seeing them as your lessers.\n\n\u201cRaise your game up!\u201d is the pithy philosophy of some beneficiaries of King\u2019s largesse. It\u2019s what they shout to the black poor for whom King actually fought. King died supporting the Memphis garbage workers as they went on strike for a decent wage back in 1968, but if they did that today in a black middle-class neighborhood, we\u2019d have some black folks ask in social media why they had to see these dirty men walking on their sidewalks, and why couldn\u2019t they protest somewhere else?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any ghetto black kids being bused into our neighborhoods\u201d is what they do say today when King\u2019s mission of erasing structural educational inequity means that their Capri Sun-sipping black children would sit side by side with a black kid from the projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, King\u2019s dream\u2014the one that spoke of centering the inequities of black America, particularly around educational access and poverty, into America\u2019s consciousness\u2014had turned into a RushCard nightmare of petty capitalism and the struggle to be seen as upper black middle class through the accumulation of expensive but rapidly depreciating things.\n\nI imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic. And yet I am not so opposed to capitalism that I have failed to see its relative merits. It started out with a noble and high motive, to block the trade monopolies of nobles, but like most human systems it falls victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes.\n\nThese were the words of a young King writing to his wife, Coretta, in 1952. They were prophetic, and for King\u2019s dream to be real for the next 50 years, black folks are going to have to move beyond their Schoolhouse Rock version of this revolutionary man and recognize that many have been brainwashed into loving a King dream that only Ronald Reagan would recognize. And the sad reality is that the gentrification of our black middle-class neighborhoods was long preceded by the gentrification of our mentalities toward one another as black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose 14-year-old black boys back in 1980 were privileged to get that Loyola education, and we realized that the doors opened by King had made it possible. But we also knew that we weren\u2019t getting an education just to have good credit and brag about our newest Chinese-sweatshop-built mobile phone. The true meaning of King for the next 50 years is one that makes us care about black people, black community and blackness, not just for altruism\u2019s sake but because we love ourselves. That\u2019s when King\u2019s dream becomes relevant and real, even when we\u2019ve reached middle-class respectability.", "keywords": ["white", "philosophy", "kings", "loyola", "folks", "martin", "social", "black", "jr", "mean", "gentrifiers", "blacks", "king", "gentrified", "luther", "school", "words", "does"], "polarity": 0.050879399521374866, "subjectivity": 0.4182667207049923},

And yes, I've seen ODB and his homeboys doing choreographed dance moves. I've seen photos of him and friends shirtless, standing close to one another.\n\nAnd yes, I've even seen the one of him in the rainbow underwear.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. is not gay.\n\nOr maybe he is.\n\nWhich brings me to two points: Black men are still archaic when it comes to anything remotely outside the male-centered construction of masculinity, and we really need to grow up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the staunch and limited definition of black maleness as defined by most black men, there are only two categories in which men's behaviors live: straight and gay. You're either one or the other, and there is little room for debate.\n\nUndefined sexuality doesn't live in the barbershop conversation of black masculinity. So because Beckham's antics, his shirtless dancing and hot tub shenanigans can't be identified on the straight scale, he must be gay. Don't believe me? His friend and former Louisiana State University teammate Kavahra Holmes, who danced with Beckham in one of his viral online posts, had to speak about his sexuality because the internet just wouldn't chill.\n\n\"It's crazy how we been brothers for so long and if anybody really knows us know anywhere we go they see us being clowns and dancing but of course it's made as 'we gay,\u2019\u201d Holmes wrote on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Strictly brotherhood and just cuz we dancing having fun don't make us gay.. I dance with our [sic] without him and vice versa so the 'gay' comments really funny .. We laughing \u2026 But we gone keep dancing lol,\" he continued.\n\nKeep dancing, indeed.\n\nClearly, Odell Beckham Jr. and friends are not concerned about how their sexuality is perceived, and, in fact, I'm convinced that ODB is trolling us. He knows that his sexuality is a topic of discussion, and he keeps doing things that have us talking. His carefree expression of black maleness is a beautiful exploration of boundary-pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I find it hilarious that one of the top five players in one of the most brutal sports doesn't care what you think about who he is. He's Dennis Rodman minus the drugs and other off-the-court slipups. He's Omar Little from The Wire minus the boyfriend, trench coat and sawed-off shotgun. He doesn't care what you think of him and his carefreeness. He's expanding the idea of masculinity and brushing up against all who believe football players should be beer-can-crushing barbarians. And, clearly, he likes it this way. At this point, I really think that Odell Beckham Jr. sits at home thinking about how he can grow the idea of masculinity when not dominating the league's best corners.\n\nLet's not forget: Odell Beckham Jr. is a product of a fitted generation\u2014a generation whose jeans are slim and shirts are small; their dances are loose and their hair is dyed; and they aren't as obsessed about sexuality as generations before them. This generation not only has given us Frank Ocean, Lil B, Jaden Smith and Young Thug but also has fully embraced their non-gender conformity. They have embraced their uniqueness, and the generation before them\u2014the ones whose parents screamed on them for wearing their clothes so big and baggy\u2014can't stop judging the uniqueness of the generation after them.\n\nWho cares if Odell Beckham Jr. likes dancing with his shirtless friends? Or if he and his teammates kick it in the hot tub (no time machine)? Not me. Times are changing; masculinity is begging to have the definition expanded a bit to include individual expression. And this isn't the first time. NBA players did it in the \u201970s with their flamboyant dress. Hell, Russell Westbrook and Cam Newton continue to push the boundaries of men's fashion. Former NFL player and college standout Michael Sam did it after he came out as a proud gay man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can't continue holding black men to the simplest, most barbaric, most archaic form of what being a man entails. If so, we will always be limited. We will always be expressionless, grunting sloths, and aren't we more than that? Odell Beckham Jr. does whatever he wants, and that includes dogging your favorite team's defense. Maybe the focus really needs to be on how to stop the fun he's having on the field (looking at you, my beloved Washington Redskin and Beckham nemesis Josh Norman), rather than worrying about the fun he's having off of it.\n\nStephen A.

In the apology, the Girls star acknowledges the \u201coften violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies, as well as false accusations by white women toward black men.\u201d\n\nIn her newsletter Lenny, Dunham had this to say about a close encounter with Beckham:\n\n\n\nI was sitting next to Odell Beckham Jr., and it was so amazing because it was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards. He was like, \"That's a marshmallow. That's a child. That's a dog.\" It wasn't mean\u2014he just seemed confused. The vibe was very much like, \"Do I want to [f\u2014k] it? Is it wearing a \u2026 yep, it's wearing a tuxedo. I'm going to go back to my cell phone.\" It was like we were forced to be together, and he literally was scrolling Instagram rather than have to look at a woman in a bow tie. I was like, \"This should be called the Metropolitan Museum of Getting Rejected by Athletes.\"\n\nYes, that happened. You can read Dunham\u2019s Instagram apology below:\n\n\n\nI owe Odell Beckham Jr. an apology. Despite my moments of bravado, I struggle at industry events (and in life) with the sense that I don't rep a certain standard of beauty and so when I show up to the Met Ball surrounded by models and swan-like actresses it's hard not to feel like a sack of flaming garbage. This felt especially intense with a handsome athlete as my dinner companion and a bunch of women I was sure he'd rather be seated with. But I went ahead and projected these insecurities and made totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking, then presented those assumptions as facts. I feel terrible about it. Because after listening to lots of valid criticism, I see how unfair it is to ascribe misogynistic thoughts to someone I don't know AT ALL. Like, we have never met, I have no idea the kind of day he's having or what his truth is. But most importantly, I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies- as well as false accusations by white women towards black men. I'm so sorry, particularly to OBJ, who has every right to be on his cell phone. The fact is I don't know about his state of mind (I don't know a lot of things) and I shouldn't have acted like I did. Much love and thanks, Lena\n\nDunham does not mention her attempts \u201cto grind [her] ass on Michael B. Jordan for an additional twenty minutes\u201d before leaving the Met Gala. She has since edited that line out of her interview with Schumer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for her completely \u201cnarcissistic assumptions\u201d about Beckham, The Root\u2019s Stephen Crockett Jr. noted, \u201cThe Girls creator took all her self-loathing and placed it on the New York Giants star receiver.\u201d Put differently, she weaponized her body against him while centering herself as the victim.\n\nThese kinds of \u201cassumptions\u201d and lies about black masculinity and predatory behavior have led to such cases as the 1944 execution of George Stinney Jr. Stinney, the youngest person executed in the United States in the 20th century, was 14 years old and weighed 95 pounds when he was accused of murdering two white girls with a railroad spike. After a long legal battle, his wrongful conviction\u2014which was handed down by an all-white male jury in 10 minutes\u2014was overturned in 2014.\n\nThese assumptions and lies also led to the 1931 false imprisonment and wrongful convictions of Alabama\u2019s Scottsboro Boys, who were accused of raping two white women; the false imprisonment and wrongful conviction of William Harper after Dorothy Skaggs accused him of rape in Virginia that same year; the 1955 murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till by white supremacists for allegedly whistling at a white woman; and the 1989 false imprisonment and wrongful convictions of New York\u2019s Central Park Five, who were accused of raping a white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are just a few examples of the more high-profile cases.\n\nThe hypersexualization of black men in the United States goes back to the antebellum South, when slavery was built and maintained by continued sexual violence against black women. Enslaved black men were often forced to rape enslaved black women in order to produce children who, of course, would be born into slavery. White women were able to fulfill their desires and assert their power on the bodies of black men\u2014and cry victim if the need arose. These interracial \u201crelationships\u201d were somewhat accepted as long as a child was not produced. If, by chance, contraception failed and an abortion was not obtained, the resulting biracial children were either placed into slavery or became victims of infanticide.\n\nAccording to Lisa Lindquist Dorr\u2019s White Women, Rape, and the Power of Race in Virginia, 1900-1960, that tepid societal acceptance ended after the Civil War. White womanhood had always been a privileged racial class\u2014though they, too, were raped by white men. But after Reconstruction, the \u201crape myth\u201d of the black male beast that hungered for white female flesh began as a way to protect and perpetuate white supremacist capitalist patriarchy:\n\n\n\nAfter Reconstruction, whites conflated black men's desires for white women with their desire for political rights as men, thus creating the rape myth. By the twentieth century, the rape myth was at its height, and it structured most white southerners' beliefs about the consequences of allowing interaction between white women and black men. The rhetoric about black men's propensity to rape and the corresponding need for white men to protect white women flourished both in debates about black men's civil and political rights and in discussions about new freedoms and opportunities for white women. The rape myth thus enforced white women's subordination to white men and the social, economic, and political power of whites over blacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIda B. Wells-Barnett risked her life to challenge this \"rape myth\" in the 1890s by circulating anti-lynching pamphlets that called out white women's complicity in the criminalization of black men. Read her 1892 Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases here.\n\nStill, the method of using white female bodies as a means to ensure the economic and political power of white men continued and was evident in both the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, which led to the destruction of \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d and the Rosewood Massacre of 1923. Both incidents were sparked by a white woman alleging that a black man had raped her, but the mob violence was flamed because many black men in both areas were doing better financially than their white counterparts.\n\nAnd into this fraught history steps Lena Dunham, who has now realized several things:\n\nBlack male bodies are not the property of white women. There is no mandate that black penises must jump to attention in the mere presence of white female bodies. There is no decree that states that black men must stare with admiration while white women hold court. Black men are allowed to attend a fancy event and not want to \u201cf\u2014k\u201d the white women sitting next to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunham\u2019s statements do not exist in a vacuum, especially now as the resurfacing of the 1999 rape allegations against Nate Parker\u2014for which he was acquitted\u2014have brought discussions about toxic masculinity, racism and rape culture to the fore. The woman who pressed charges against Parker was, just like most of Bill Cosby\u2019s alleged victims, white.\n\nIn both cases, black feminists have worked relentlessly to unbind race and gender. They have concentrated with laser-sharp focus on society's collective need to learn and unlearn the definition of consent\u2014informed, implied, explicit, active or otherwise. Despite their best efforts, the narrative that continues to raise its ugly head is \u201cThis is just another white woman accusing a black man of rape\u201d\u2014and any black women who say differently are in league with the White Man\u2122 trying to bring a brother down.\n\nThis deeply entrenched stereotype is largely due to the racist history touched on here, but it may also stem from the reality that black women and girls are less likely to report being raped. Why? Because black women and girls who grow up being called \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cwhore,\u201d their sexuality policed and baptized away from them, have also been taught that there is a racist system that victimizes black men and boys\u2014because there is. Rarely is focus placed on the criminalization of black women and girls who also face both state and community violence, while still laboring under the expectation that it is their responsibility to protect black men and boys at all costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnequivocally, no man\u2014black, white or other\u2014is absolved of his responsibility as a human being not to rape other human beings. And it is critical to note here that despite a history of racist false accusations, only 2 to 8 percent of rape allegations are false, and 97 percent of rapists will never spend a day in jail. Despite these sobering statistics, when white women etch their own assumptions, privilege, insecurities and desires upon the bodies of black men, particularly black men who have not shown interest, discussions about rape culture become mired in racial tension and often come to a screeching halt.\n\nDunham\u2019s apology and acknowledgment of her racism in this incident is important and duly noted; however, it is equally important for her to understand that her reckless words help perpetuate a toxic culture that continues to oppress and endanger all women\u2014even white, privileged ones like herself.", "keywords": ["white", "odell", "false", "theres", "bodies", "woman", "girls", "black", "assumptions", "long", "jr", "rape", "lena", "men", "women", "lying", "violent"], "polarity": -0.02048668503213957, "subjectivity": 0.3428616932310111},

While this was not an event affiliated with California Baptist University, two current CBU students were involved.

Not just as main characters, but even in the background. Black people not only aren\u2019t of interest in Dunham\u2019s New York\u2014they don\u2019t even live there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Maybe he was a huge Lena Dunham fan until he read her book and got weirded out.\n\nIn Dunham\u2019s memoir, Not that Kind of Girl, she describes in detail how at 7 she began a very invasive kind of sexual exploration with her one-year sister that included opening her vagina and paying her sister with candy for long mouth kisses. She also noted that when she was 17, she would lie in the bed next to her prepubescent sister and masturbate.\n\n\n\n7. Maybe he was busy playing Pok\u00e9mon Go?\n\nThat s\u2014t is like crack. Think about it\u2014he\u2019s at the Met Gala and he\u2019s fast. If everyone else is busy schmoozing and Beckham stays focused, he could clean up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to get to know Dunham.\n\nThe most telling part of Dunham\u2019s passage is that she actually believed that Beckham looked her over. The privilege in her passage is breathtaking. Not because he wouldn\u2019t have but that he absolutely must have. This feeds into a plethora of black male sexual stereotypes and white women as desired objects\u2014even when they are ignored.\n\n\n\n9. He\u2019s not some dude from the corner who hollers at every woman under 40 he sees.\n\nI know there is a belief that all black men catcall women, but Beckham isn\u2019t that dude. The sad part is that even with his status and prestige, Dunham objectified him and reduced him to street-corner status.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Black male interest in white women (any white woman) is greatly overstated and exaggerated.\n\nSeriously, not all black men want a fat white woman.\n\nStephen A.

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

We have so many different stories in this book about so many of our experiences.\n\nThe stunning and always straightforward Bond also sat down with The Glow Up\u2019s video team to talk about how Black Girls Rock! came to be and why having our own platforms, media and space to tell our stories is so vital, especially to future generations\u2014you can watch above.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while there are 69 incredible black women featured in her new book, Bond\u2014who also holds the trademark to \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d\u2014let us know that there\u2019s still plenty more ground she plans to cover in letting the world know that black girls do indeed rock: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s probably a million more women that I would want to put in this book if I could, so I may have to do volumes.\u201d", "keywords": ["know", "dj", "theres", "girls", "black", "beverly", "bond", "world", "rock", "glow", "book", "women", "founder", "does"], "polarity": 0.21084595959595953, "subjectivity": 0.5434911616161616},

From blaxploitation films like Cleopatra Jones to even comedies like Bill & Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventures, Casey\u2019s acting career ran the gamut. After a career that spanned more than 40 years, Casey, who was born in West Virginia and raised in Columbus, Ohio, died from an undisclosed illness Wednesday in Los Angeles at the age of 78.\n\nBefore even stepping foot in Hollywood, Casey was an accomplished athlete, going from playing for Bowling Green University to playing in the NFL for eight seasons. Casey\u2019s athletic prowess would also eventually prove to be an asset on-screen.\n\nMost people will immediately bring up Casey\u2019s role as Tamara Dobson\u2019s love interest in 1973\u2019s Cleopatra Jones as his first foray into film, but before that, Casey teamed up with another legendary football player, Jim Brown, in ...tick...tick...tick... and Black Gunn, and his first film in 1969 was a Zapata-style Western, Guns of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nCasey\u2019s acting career, which involved feature films and television shows, had him starring opposite many Hollywood heavyweights. In the 1981 film Sharky\u2019s Machine, he teamed up with Burt Reynolds as a detective; he joined Reynolds again in the 1987 film Rent-a-Cop.\n\nEven though he also appeared in films like Never Say Never Again, Revenge of the Nerds and Spies Like Us, most people may not even realize that Casey also set a precedent when he starred in NBC\u2019s first sitcom centered on a black family. In 1979, Casey played Mike Harris in Harris and Company, a short-lived series about a widower who moves his family from Detroit to Los Angeles. Although the series aired for only four episodes, it\u2019s safe to say that it gave NBC the blueprint to rehash the black family sitcom with The Cosby Show years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, many people will remember Casey from his role in Keenen Ivory Wayans\u2019 1988 film I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka, but Casey was also an accomplished painter and poet who received praise from the great Maya Angelou. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Savannah College of Art and Design, where he served as chairman.\n\n\u201cCasey has the heart and the art to put his insight on canvas, and I am heartened by his action. For then I can comprehend his vision and some of my own. His art makes my road less rocky, and my path less crooked,\u201d Angelou said in 2003.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Casey was a Renaissance man, and his legacy will live on forever in his art and filmography.", "keywords": ["bernie", "caseys", "film", "blaxploitation", "family", "career", "black", "casey", "films", "art", "say", "teamed", "nfl"], "polarity": 0.24602784602784605, "subjectivity": 0.413063063063063},

At least that\u2019s the conclusion of \u201cWhy It\u2019s Hard for Conservatives to Date in D.C. Right Now,\u201d a piece in The Washingtonian magazine that\u2019s become all the talk in Washington circles this week. Or at least some Washington circles.\n\nConservatives (mostly men) in the article lament that D.C. liberals would rather swipe left than settle in for a night of Tucker Carlson and chill. The dating deficit isn\u2019t just affecting the men, though. Conservative women who\u2019ve swarmed D.C. since Donald Trump got into office are forced to alter their dating choices, too. From The Washingtonian:\n\n\n\nConversely, a young White House staffer says she typically looks for someone from the South when swiping through profiles, as she thinks they\u2019ll be more receptive to her support of the President.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: She\u2019s looking for a white guy from the South. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not on BlackSinglesMeet.com scrolling for alumni from FAMU. Which got me thinking: Are black conservatives having the same dating problems as white conservatives in D.C.? Is there some lonely black Republican guy out there wondering why Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee never responded to his Diamond and Silk Chit Chat Live Evite? Is there some black Republican woman out there trying to turn men\u2019s heads who\u2019s frustrated because everyone thinks her \u201cLock Her Up\u201d T-shirt is advertising a new spot on 14th Street to get their braids done? I took an unofficial survey of every black Republican I know to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this polling has some limitations\u2014most of the black Republicans I know are already married, and it was hard finding LGBT black Republicans. I know a few, but to this day, I have yet to meet a black lesbian Republican. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, riding unicorns and paying for Janelle Mon\u00e1e tickets with four-leaf clovers dipped in vibranium, but I couldn\u2019t find any before deadline.\n\nThe vast majority of people I spoke to said that being a conservative or a Republican didn\u2019t hurt their D.C. dating prospects at all. If anything, it may have helped. The people I spoke to agreed to share their stories on the condition that their identities be kept secret. So The Root promised to be one of the few outlets in D.C. that WON\u2019T leak Republican testimony.\n\n\u201cMy boys introduce me as \u2018That\u2019s my Republican friend,\u2019 and women are, like, intrigued,\u201d said one prominent GOP state party member in his late 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know Republicans who get play, and I know some that are wack,\u201d said a Gen X Republican married to a woman who worked on former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cI mean, most folks don\u2019t bang with 45 like that, so if that\u2019s how you start and end every conversation, what do you expect?\u201d\n\nThe emerging theme was that being a black Republican wasn\u2019t as big a problem so long as:\n\nYou focused on the black part.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a Trump-supporting black person.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a problem for me,\u201d a millennial black Republican who works in media said. \u201cI mean, my girlfriend knows I\u2019m a black man. She knows that the lens through which I live my conservative politics is as a black man. Besides, her momma said, \u2018As long as he isn\u2019t one of those TRUMP conservatives,\u2019 and I definitely am not!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated lots of men I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said a 40-something black woman who works as a newspaper editor. \u201cBut Trump supporters are assholes!\u201d She noted that a co-worker set her up with a Trumper about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was very handsome, successful, but so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went on and on about how journalists should be locked up and how immigrants are ruining America.\u201d Clearly lapsing into the worst date of her life, \u201cAnd you know the worst part? He was a Jamaican immigrant!\u201d\n\nA lot of what I was hearing spoke to the way that black folks navigate \u201cparty\u201d politics versus universal issues when it comes to dating and mating. For many, being a Republican is like a form of code-switching, and potential dates accept that, but \u201cTrumpism\u201d is a lifestyle choice that will get you no love. I swear on a stack of secondhand copies of Gifted Hands that most black men and women in Washington would go on a date with a small-government, lower-taxes, pro-life potential bae, and even listen to some shading of Obama, but there are limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went on a few dates with a black Republican soon after I moved to D.C. Everything was cool until we started talking about Black Lives Matter and she turned into Stacey Dash. Not the \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d Stacey Dash, but Fox News, \u201cWe should cancel Black History Month and I hate BET even though I used to twerk in their videos,\u201d hypocritical Stacey Dash.\n\nI think this woman found political debates to be sexy, but by the time she was explaining why black folks shouldn\u2019t be given access to police dashcam and bodycam video because we\u2019d \u201cjust go crazy and riot,\u201d it was a wrap. I wanted to just give her a prepaid Metro card back to the sunken place, but I was too much of a gentleman; and besides, she probably would have liked it.\n\nMy extensive survey and lab work could only lead to one conclusion: Conservative white, Trump-loving people must suck at dating in D.C., because black conservatives aren\u2019t having these problems. Also, this isn\u2019t just a Trump issue; Breitbart complained about the same thing during the Obama administration, and Tomi Lahren\u2019s living Dorian Gray painting, Ann Coulter, said the same thing under Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why a whole article about it? What would compel a few \u201cMAGA\u201d-hat-wearing men and women to whine to The Washingtonian that their weekends are as empty as a Trump Christmas party?\n\n\u201cThat was just some \u2018woe is me\u2019 white-boy stuff right there,\u201d said the GOP state official. \u201cThey think they\u2019re entitled, but look, you enabled this guy [Trump]; you\u2019re complicit in what this country is going through. Why should anybody throw you the box?\u201d\n\nNever fear, though, young white conservatives. There are still some options for the less-than-discerning, Trump-supporting D.C. dater. Just know that the first 20 minutes might cost you about $130,000, but you definitely won\u2019t be judged for riding the Trump train.", "keywords": ["white", "know", "doing", "conservatives", "dc", "carlson", "republican", "chill", "black", "tucker", "dating", "ones", "trump", "date", "men", "women", "fine"], "polarity": -0.026833694083694067, "subjectivity": 0.4630097402597401},

What time of year, you ask? The time of year when President Racist von WallBuilder reads his prepared speech from a teleprompter, and a roomful of fat, rich white guys and affluent white women applaud as if the world were crafted from his tiny hands. This is also the time when people of color throw glorious amounts of side eye, teeth-sucking sneers and reluctant golf claps as the president presents his State of the Union\u2014or Uniom, as it were, on some tickets.\n\n\n\nBut this year, unlike years past, the Democrats are piping mad! Oh, they are super mad, son. In fact, many of them have planned silent protests just to show how mad they are. I mean, it\u2019s the Democrats, so what did you expect? Did you really think someone was planning to show a true level of disgust toward a president so evil and vile that he\u2019s started to make George W. Bush look palatable?\n\n\n\nBelow is a listing of planned protests that might even be effective if the president actually cared about the rest of the 99 percent.\n\n\n\nOff the top, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) aren\u2019t attending the president\u2019s address. Everyone knows that Auntie Maxine is not here to play nice with this president. Wilson and the president have never been on good terms, but that rift grew wider when the president reportedly told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that \u201che knew what he\u2019d signed up for.\u201d Wilson took offense at the heartless comment, and Trump, as he\u2019s been known to do, began attacking the congresswoman on Twitter. So when it came to this year\u2019s State of the Union, Wilson knew that the president didn\u2019t deserve her presence or her sweet cowboy hat!\n\n\n\n\u201cTo go would be to honor the president and I don\u2019t think he deserves to be honored at this time, after being so hateful towards black people and then black countries,\u201d she told CNN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeks had this to say about this year\u2019s State of the Union address, the New York Post reports: \u201cI cannot give this man, who does not respect me, the respect to be in that audience. I will not be there.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats who have noted that they won\u2019t be attending include Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.) and John Lewis (Ga.); Illinois Reps. Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush; and Reps. Albio Sires (N.J.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who had this to say earlier this month on why she wouldn\u2019t be attending:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect this list of nonattendees to grow before the president hits the podium and spits out his first lie.\n\n\n\nBecause the president is a sexual predator who was captured on audio boasting that his financial success allows him to kiss and grab women he doesn\u2019t know by their \u201cpussy,\u201d some members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to wear all black to the event in support of the #MeToo movement and will wear pins that honor the memory and legacy of Recy Taylor, a black woman who, in 1944, was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a group of white men.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women & Girls, plans to bring Taylor\u2019s niece as her guest to Tuesday night\u2019s remarks. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) will be bringing Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victim Advocates, as his plus one; Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, will be a guest of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.); and Danielle McGuire, an author and historian who has researched and written about Taylor, will be a guest of Rep.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nSeveral Congress members are using their invitations to bring faces of the immigration debate, specially those affected by the current stalemate over DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, affecting young people brought illegally to the U.S. as children.\n\nSome of the more prominent faces of the debate who will be in attendance: Cindy Garcia, the wife of Jorge Garcia, who was deported to Mexico earlier this month after living in the U.S. for 30 years. The Garcia family\u2019s emotional goodbye inside the airport was captured on video and went viral. Cindy will be the guest of Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) has invited Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose father, Melecio Andazola Morales, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after going in for a scheduled appointment to get his green card, Roll Call reports.\n\nLast but not least, Melania Trump is expected to make an appearance. I know that, on the surface, her presence wouldn\u2019t be seen as a protest, and truthfully, it isn\u2019t, but ever since reports surfaced that the president paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels, the first lady has been noticeably absent.\n\nAccording to the New York Times: \u201cMelania Trump, a notoriously private first lady, made three very public decisions: She canceled a trip abroad with the president, made an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and flew to Mar-a-Lago, where she spent part of her short trip relaxing at the spa.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer presence is a reminder that she\u2019s willing to save her marriage, and my hope is that the camera continues to pan across her face to show how truly dead she is inside. I hope that these two continue to stay together for as long as they both shall live and she continues to haunt his waking life.

Calin began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referencing Stephen Paddock adding that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and salutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cell phone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called, while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. Police charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed and, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, He was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver. Nevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\n\u201cNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\u201d\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d 1 October is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Calin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylan Roof, who shot up Emanuel AME in Charleston, SC\u2014our home state\u2014killing 9 parishioners during a Wednesday night bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeyward thwarted Calin Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on February 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday night bible study.\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname. James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d) who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semi-pro football.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each others\u2019 sisters. We ate at each others\u2019 table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my playcousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that, of the 104 active shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed who managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly 3 active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson, Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my playcousin and lifelong friend. He is a father.

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out. Then they heard gunshots, and about 15 of them stopped in their tracks before running back toward the classroom. At that point, however, Gard locked the door and refused to let them back in, Gallagher said.\n\n\u201cWe were stuck in the hall for four total minutes, ducking and in fear for our lives,\u201d Gallagher wrote.

Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls and only one of their children was a boy.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

That shooting has led to discussion about possibly arming teachers in the event of an active shooter situation, an idea endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAlong those lines, the Florida House Appropriations Committee just recently approved training teachers to carry guns in class under the direction of local law enforcement, if school superintendents or school boards approve.

He also was so unhinged that a CNN anchor asked if he had been drinking because she smelled alcohol on his breath.\n\n\n\nWell, what do you know? It looks like Nunberg has come to his senses and did what we all knew he was going to do because guys like him don\u2019t do well in prison. Just two days after he went on a Ferris Bueller-style media blitz of epic rants, including challenging Mueller to arrest him, he\u2019s completely changed his tune.\n\nIn an interview with WABC Radio, Nunberg turned church boy and noted that he gathered everything that the subpoena asked for\u2014including emails, text messages and communications he had with 10 campaign associates\u2014and handed it all over before Wednesday\u2019s deadline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding anything back. ...

Because what do you make with the woman who seems to make everything she touches grow? \u201cJoyful greens\u201d!", "keywords": ["yesterdays", "surprise", "haddish", "oprah", "run", "woman", "importance", "haddishs", "tiffany", "ellen", "wings", "teaches", "joyful", "tiff", "earnest"], "polarity": 0.4666666666666666, "subjectivity": 0.7083333333333335},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["white", "moments", "2017", "land", "black", "twitter", "kaepernick", "tyson", "won", "la", "women"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

She is one of too many black mothers who have died because of this country\u2019s legacy of structural racism.\n\n\n\nKyira Johnson, affectionately called Kira by family and friends, died of hemorrhagic shock after enduring 10 hours of internal bleeding after giving birth to her son Langston at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on April 12, 2016. When the news of Johnson\u2019s death broke, it was devastating for her family, community and all of us who are concerned about the state of black people in this country and the world.\n\n\n\nWhen we sound the call \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d we mean every black life everywhere. Our call must center and demand justice for the rising rates of black maternal mortality in the United States. Too many black mothers\u2019 lives are on the line throughout our pregnancies and in childbirth.\n\nKyira Johnson\u2019s death was preventable. Not only her death, but the manner in which she died, exposes the horrific state of the U.S. health care system, especially for black women and mothers. Each year, more than 12,000 women die because of preventable causes related to childbirth and pregnancy.\n\nBlack women are between three and four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related issues (pdf) than white women. Studies have shown that these rates persist even when black and white women have the same socioeconomic status. Statistics for black women in the South are worse across the board given the legacy of state governments\u2019 reluctance to guarantee basic health care services and reproductive rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a black mother, I am acutely aware of the dangers associated with black women\u2019s health care in this country. My experience after giving birth, notably after a cesarean section, came with its own set of complications, from pneumonia to the threat of blood clots, that I was not informed about or prepared for.\n\n\n\nI am alarmed by the abysmal standards that our health care system provides our black women and mothers. It\u2019s clear that while some of us survive childbirth, many of us have died, and many of our black mothers will continue to die at the hands of medical neglect if we do not demand change.\n\nIt\u2019s critical that the health care crisis that black communities face in the United States be labeled and understood as an international human rights crisis (pdf). In the same ways we demand justice in light of police brutality, we demand justice for this form of state violence against black bodies, and especially black mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s necessary to take concrete steps to improve our health care system and guarantee our right to healthy birthing options.\n\nMomsRising, a grassroots organization of more than 1 million mothers and their families, has organized a candlelight vigil for Kyira Johnson and other black mothers in Los Angeles on Friday at 7 p.m. at the intersection of San Vicente Boulevard and Gracie Allen Drive outside Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where Johnson died. The date, June 23, marks a national day of action and also would have been Johnson\u2019s 41st birthday.\n\nIn the same ways we demand justice in light of police brutality, we demand justice for this form of state violence against black bodies, and especially black mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe facts leading up to Johnson\u2019s death expose clear negligence on behalf of hospital staff as they insufficiently addressed her bleeding body, pale state and visible unwellness. Johnson\u2019s family have been forever denied her love, care and support, and Johnson, herself, was deprived of a life with dignity and the right to raise her children.\n\n\u201cIt is in Kyira\u2019s honor that the #4Kira4Moms vigil will bring to light the thousands of women and families who have suffered in this nation from careless and preventable negligence related to childbirth and pregnancy. Why are women dying from childbirth in the richest country on the face of the globe? We must bring awareness to this issue and demand solutions! Kyira should be here,\u201d exclaimed Johnson\u2019s mother-in-law, Judge Glenda Hatchett.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoin us Friday and sign the online petition. Stand with us as we call on the U.S. Congress to sign into law H.R. 1318, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2017, which mandates stronger maternal health protocols in the fight against maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as the reduction of the racial disparities associated with pregnancy and childbirth in our health care system.\n\nOur concerns are also addressed to the California Department of Public Health and California Legislature. We demand statewide universal maternal-risk screenings in collaboration with providers and advocates, as well as patient-safety bundles at birthing sites in every hospital, and that all hospitals provide maternity services complete with a set of educational activities related to obstetric hemorrhage.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also firmly stand with Johnson\u2019s family in their call for an investigation into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n\nBlack women and mothers deserve better. We deserve higher standards in the health care we have access to and receive, and we must work together to ensure that black mothers and mothers everywhere don\u2019t risk our lives giving life.\n\nPatrisse Khan-Cullors is co-founder of Black Lives Matter and a senior fellow at MomsRising.", "keywords": ["demand", "state", "means", "justice4kyira", "died", "black", "health", "johnsons", "mothers", "women", "care", "justice"], "polarity": 0.012681339977851614, "subjectivity": 0.42167358803986704},

But I no longer believe these things are true ...\n\n\n\nI know they are.\n\n\n\nLast night, while sitting on the couch engaged in a time-honored Friday night negro tradition called \u201cchillin\u2019,\u201d I received a text that simply said: \u201cDid you hear about Junie Poonie and that mass shooter?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nI contacted Junie\u2019s sister first, and she sent me the link to the story of how her brother stopped a man who wanted to become the \u201cgreatest mass shooter in history\u201d by filming himself massacring people in a Las Vegas, Nevada church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand this story, you must first know the hierarchy of the Black family tree. There are black people across this country who have blood relatives they don\u2019t know about, including sisters, brothers and sometimes parents. Ranking higher than any DNA-based relationship is the earned honorific of \u201cplaycousin.\u201d A playcousin is a defacto sibling. It is more family member than actual family.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother\u2019s best friend had four children. She was as much my aunt as any of my mother\u2019s sisters. Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson, Jr. but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox 5 Vegas, on February 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas Church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges, asleep on a pew. Junie asked Hodges if he needed some help because he looked disheveled. Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie. He can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say.) Calin began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referencing Stephen Paddock adding that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and salutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cell phone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called, while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. Police charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed and, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, He was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver. Nevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\n\u201cNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\u201d\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d 1 October is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Calin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylan Roof, who shot up Emanuel AME in Charleston, SC\u2014our home state\u2014killing 9 parishioners during a Wednesday night bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeyward thwarted Calin Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on February 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday night bible study.\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname. James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d) who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semi-pro football.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each others\u2019 sisters. We ate at each others\u2019 table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my playcousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that, of the 104 active shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed who managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly 3 active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson, Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my playcousin and lifelong friend. He is a father. He is a husband.\n\nJunie Poonie is a good guy.\n\nHe did not have a gun.", "keywords": ["know", "playcousin", "myth", "disproved", "junie", "person", "mass", "las", "guys", "shooter", "hodges", "vegas", "stopped", "good", "shooting", "guns"], "polarity": 0.0908712121212121, "subjectivity": 0.47286706349206353},

Kelley, who was known to have a violent past, should not have been able to buy firearms and body armor because of his domestic violence conviction back in 2014 while serving at the Halloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.\n\nHowever, according to the Washington Post, the Air Force has admitted that it dropped the ball and failed to follow the appropriate procedures to alert federal authorities about Kelley\u2019s past, thus enabling the former airman to purchase weapons before he attacked a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than 20 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelley had been court-martialed while in the Air Force and was ultimately convicted in 2014 for abusing his wife and his stepchild. He was sentenced to a year in prison before being kicked out of the military with a bad-conduct discharge.\n\n\u201cInitial information indicates that Kelley\u2019s domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center database,\u201d Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement Monday.\n\nStefanek added that Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein have ordered an investigation into Kelley\u2019s case and \u201crelevant policies and procedures.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times notes that under federal law, Kelley\u2014who assaulted his wife and toddler stepson to the point where he cracked the child\u2019s skull\u2014should not have been able to legally purchase the military-style rifle and the three other guns that he had accumulated over the past few years.\n\nThe Times reports that federal law has about 11 criteria that would prevent someone from purchasing a gun. Two of them, it appears, would apply in Kelley\u2019s case: conviction of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison\u2014i.e., the assault of his stepson, which carried a maximum sentence of five years\u2014and conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Air Force will also be investigating whether other convictions had not been reported to the federal database for firearms background checks, according to the Times.\n\nAcademy Sports, a firearms retailer, confirmed Monday that Kelley had bought two weapons from its stores after clearing federal background checks this year and last year, according to the Post. It is still not clear whether those weapons were the ones that were used in Sunday\u2019s massacre, but nonetheless, it showcases the Air Force\u2019s failure to follow Pentagon guidelines in making sure that certain violent offenses get reported to the FBI.\n\nA separate law should have prevented Kelley, a violent offender, from purchasing the body armor that he was seen wearing during the mass shooting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeoffery Corn, a former Army lawyer and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, told the Post that there seems to be some confusion in the armed forces about what gets reported to authorities.\n\nThe Post notes:\n\nCorn said it appears there is confusion within the Air Force, and other military branches, about only reporting violent crimes that result in dishonorable discharges, which are more severe punishments under military law than the bad-conduct discharge Kelley received. \u201cEither the Department of Defense is reporting these convictions, or they\u2019re not,\u201d Corn said. \u201cHow is the federal statute going to be effectively implemented if they aren\u2019t reporting these convictions?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times notes that Kelley\u2019s bad-conduct discharge does not, in and of itself, mean an automatic ban from purchasing guns.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nThe Department of Defense has reported only one domestic violence case to the federal database for gun purchase background checks, records show. It has reported 11,000 service members to the database, but almost all of them were because of dishonorable discharges, which prohibit gun purchases. Mr. Kelley, after serving 12 months in a Navy brig in California, received a \u201cbad conduct\u201d discharge, which is not by itself an automatic bar to gun purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post and the New York Times.", "keywords": ["follow", "kelley", "force", "failure", "violence", "air", "federal", "buy", "shooter", "firearms", "texas", "allowed", "post", "policies", "law", "violent", "reported", "kelleys"], "polarity": -0.03561580086580088, "subjectivity": 0.4640624098124098},

When I checked it out yesterday, it was sitting at roughly 25 million views on YouTube, and as of today, it\u2019s nearing 30 million. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Drake \u201cgot one.\u201d The song is dope on its own, but the video levels shit all the way up.\n\nThe premise is this: The video has a budget of almost a million dollars, so Drake decides to do something meaningful with that budget and gives all of it away to folks in and around Miami. He\u2019s giving out money to folks on the street, at grocery stores, in college. He\u2019s out here buying cars (and hopefully insurance and gas money\u2014them joints weren\u2019t Passats), sending people on shopping sprees and handing literal stacks of cash to folks.\n\nThere are a few ways to look at this video. You can choose to look at it as Drake shamelessly tugging at the heartstrings of anybody watching by using his video to paint himself as a sort of hood superman. Much of the video where he\u2019s not giving away money looks to be shot in various hoods of Miami. For those folks he\u2019s handing money to, maybe he\u2019s just temporarily providing a salve when what they might need is actual help (housing, education, etc.) to get and stay out of whatever their situation is.\n\nTemporary help is just that; it\u2019s not changing lives for real. That\u2019s a more cynical view of the video\u2014that Drake is basically pimping fans he\u2019s likely never going to see again for page views and clicks. Shit, he (presumably) didn\u2019t even give away his own money (though somebody still had to pay for that video, which is not shot on anybody\u2019s iPhone).\n\nOn the other hand\u2014this is where I stand\u2014Drake is doing a good deed. A lot of them, actually. And you never know who needs a good deed in their life. Or who is $20 away from being on the street. Or for whom a simple $100 can change everything, or at the very least their week. Money, for the VAST majority of Americans, is a constant struggle. Help is help, however it comes, whenever it comes. I love to see good things happen to people. I love it.\n\nWhen Oprah gives away shit, I love it and I feel happy for the recipients. When Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired, I cried with those folks who got new homes and new leases on life because sometimes, just sometimes, you need some good fortune. Or Undercover Boss, where employees who show up every day and anonymously do their job to the best of their ability are finally seen by the very people signing their checks. When one of those employees gets rewarded, it makes me emotional. I really like to see good things happen to people, especially folks who don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember being surprised when Prince died by how much he did for people. There were stories all over the place, especially in Minneapolis, of folks who had been beneficiaries of Prince\u2019s big heart. Shit, you\u2019d think Prince literally helped out every single person he came into contact with. When Prince died, people happily came out of the woodwork to talk about how generous and thoughtful he was and how he\u2019d do whatever he could to help. And he did it all anonymously. That\u2019s how I like to live my own life. I help people out when I can and it\u2019s because I realize that when you have, it\u2019s a duty to help out those in need to the best of your ability.\n\nThat\u2019s how I feel about Drake\u2019s video. I honestly don\u2019t care about whose money he gave away or how he got it. I\u2019m just glad he was helping folks who clearly needed it. When he handed those stacks to that young man and his (I assume) mother, and they both broke down crying, I felt like Drake knew that while he was handing out money, he gave them something more valuable. I don\u2019t know how anybody ended up being chosen to receive money, but you could tell after they received something, their days were a little bit better. I was moved to tears several times during the video. And I honestly don\u2019t care if I got pimped for my tears, because that wasn\u2019t fake money he was giving out, and those folks whose lives he touched appreciated it.\n\nWhen people with lots of money and resources realize that they can change folks\u2019 lives with simple gestures (and for rich people, money can be a simple gesture), I gain an appreciation for them because it shows me that they get it. I watched Drake\u2019s video and I felt like Drake \u201cgets it.\u201d He went where he saw a need and alleviated some of it.

But I no longer believe these things are true ...\n\n\n\nI know they are.\n\n\n\nLast night, while sitting on the couch engaged in a time-honored Friday night negro tradition called \u201cchillin\u2019,\u201d I received a text that simply said: \u201cDid you hear about Junie Poonie and that mass shooter?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nI contacted Junie\u2019s sister first, and she sent me the link to the story of how her brother stopped a man who wanted to become the \u201cgreatest mass shooter in history\u201d by filming himself massacring people in a Las Vegas, Nevada church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand this story, you must first know the hierarchy of the Black family tree. There are black people across this country who have blood relatives they don\u2019t know about, including sisters, brothers and sometimes parents. Ranking higher than any DNA-based relationship is the earned honorific of \u201cplaycousin.\u201d A playcousin is a defacto sibling. It is more family member than actual family.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother\u2019s best friend had four children. She was as much my aunt as any of my mother\u2019s sisters. Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson, Jr. but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox 5 Vegas, on February 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas Church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges, asleep on a pew. Junie asked Hodges if he needed some help because he looked disheveled. Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie. He can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say.) Calin began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referencing Stephen Paddock adding that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and salutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cell phone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called, while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. Police charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed and, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, He was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver. Nevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\n\u201cNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\u201d\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d 1 October is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Calin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylan Roof, who shot up Emanuel AME in Charleston, SC\u2014our home state\u2014killing 9 parishioners during a Wednesday night bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeyward thwarted Calin Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on February 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday night bible study.\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname. James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d) who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semi-pro football.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each others\u2019 sisters. We ate at each others\u2019 table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my playcousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that, of the 104 active shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed who managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly 3 active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson, Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my playcousin and lifelong friend. He is a father.

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET to see conversations with Jordan Peele, Salma Hayek and Trevor Noah and Tuesday, march 6 at 10 p.m. ET for Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Yara Shahidi.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. Now go forth and live your best life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The best part was making my way into the official after party, which ended up being super intimate and Oprah literally greeted everyone there individually. And I got to take this picture with her.\n\n", "keywords": ["harlems", "oprah", "supersoul", "chakras", "peele", "noah", "miranda", "fears", "apollo", "dont", "shahidi", "aligned", "brought", "shes", "conversations"], "polarity": 0.2450367732625797, "subjectivity": 0.5730760950519015},

Pun. And that\u2019s not even an exhaustive list! Baby Boy wasn\u2019t just a movie, it was a beacon of Blackness and what love can look like - even if ridiculous - in the hood. If we got even one third of the shenanigans in a new movie, it would pay for itself. Well, Tyrese is either trolling those of us who like good things or there is a God. Tyrese aka Black Ty aka The Professional Misspeller aka The Syntax Slaughterer teased the potential for a Baby Boy 2: Coming of Age movie by posting on IG (and then deleting) what looks to be a mockup movie poster.\n\nIn an odd twist, however, Snoop Dogg, who played Yvette\u2019s gangbanger, prison homie, ex-boyfriend Rodney in the original, is on the poster. This makes no sense since His-Name-Is-Not-Walter Rodney caught quite a few hot ones at the hands of Sweet Pea because Jody couldn\u2019t pull the trigger. Sweet Pea tho? Yeah, he did that. He did it like he was doing it for television. Straight west coast style with good form and everything. Point is, I don\u2019t know if Snoop would be in the movie as a ghost or some shit but I mean, who knows? Ya know?\n\nLong story short, I don\u2019t know about you, but the potential of a sequel to what I believe is one of the best Black movies ever made - and I\u2019m dead serious when I say that - has got me thinking about some long-standing questions I've had about their lives since the original that I'd hope might be addressed in the sequel. Such as? Such as:\n\n1. WTF?\n\nNigga, why? Why are we even GETTING a sequel. Sure, I\u2019m here for it, but I still would like to know why for come this is a thing. It\u2019s only right to ask that. I don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s a good answer. Every movie doesn\u2019t need a sequel. That is a fact. Like, I went to see Best Man Holiday but did it really need a sequel? Not at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Did Jody and Yvette\u2019s son ever build a fort again?\n\nWhen Snoop came through and crushed the buildings on the little homey, I felt really bad for him. Mostly because he\u2019s a little kid and getting his fort destroyed might have ruined his esteem for life. What if every time he sees forts he just starts crying. PLUS that nigga Rodney, at some point, never showed up again. MORE PLUS, when Rodney DID show up the first time he just moved into Yvette\u2019s place all willy nilly and was left home with her son, which, let\u2019s be real, is TERRIBLE parenting. I\u2019m just saying, I hope he built another fort.\n\n3. Did Melvin go back to jail?\n\nMy bet is yes. He had two strikes, if you\u2019ll remember. I ain\u2019t saying Melvin was a terrible person, but he had kids he wasn\u2019t taking care of \u201cbecause of their mamas,\u201d etc. It\u2019s entirely believable that the dude who put Jody through a table could end up losing his temper again and ending up back in jail. Just sayin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Did Sweet Pea become a preacher?\n\nHe had all the makings of a reformed thug turned preacherman who opens a storefront and cops some Malcolm X glasses and goes full zealot on anybody who will listen. He\u2019s like the corny version of DMX\u2019s charater in Belly.\n\n5. How many more kids do Jody and Yvette have?\n\nThey already have three (their son and the one on the way, plus his kid with Peanut) when the movie ends, but you know niggas in the hood do not believe in vasectomies and they didn\u2019t seem to believe in condoms. My money is on two more at least. And because I\u2019m a betting man, I\u2019d wager on him having another outside kid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6.What does their marriage look like?\n\nIt\u2019s implied at the end that Jody had some growing up moments. Yeah, okay. Poor Yvette is how I felt at the end of the movie. You love what you love and like what you like, but I felt like she definitely needed to be barking up another tree. Be that as it may, for their to be a sequel, they\u2019d almost have to be together or else it would be an entire movie about baby mama drama.\n\n7. Does Jody ACTUALLY grow up?\n\nLet\u2019s say that he does actually get some adult about himself, what does THAT look like? Is he a dude with a steady job - say at like the post office - and comes home and takes care of family? Seems like that might make for a short movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. How\u2019s Jody\u2019s mama\u2019s garden looking now?\n\nThat thang was looking mighty nutritious at the end of the movie. It must be a jungle back there now.\n\n9. Who dies?\n\nLook, I hate to be that dude, but this is a South Central love story, kind of. If they all made it to 15 years later I\u2019d be surprised. SOMEBODY might don\u2019t didn\u2019t not make it all the way to the sequel. I might be disappointed if everybody does, to be honest.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["nras", "organization", "gun", "deaths", "second", "legal", "directly", "dont", "right", "nra", "terrorist"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

But what happens when Oprah calls? The Glow Up asked writer Tayari Jones, who got the call from the great and powerful O in October when her latest novel, An American Marriage, was chosen as the first Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection of 2018.\n\n\n\nSo what does Oprah say when she calls to give someone life-changing news?\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018Hi, this is Oprah.\u2019 That\u2019s what she says,\u201d Jones said, laughing. \u201cAnd then she politely waits for you to get your whole freakout on. She patiently waits and then, when she\u2019s decided that\u2019s enough freakout time, she gets on to business.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbusiness\u201d is a major breakthrough for Jones, whose first novel, Leaving Atlanta, won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Crafting An American Marriage, which debuted last week to critical acclaim, was a slow and arduous journey, spanning six of the seven years since her last (also critically acclaimed) novel, Silver Sparrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t work this book out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chosen a project that was too emotionally and morally ambitious, and I couldn\u2019t work it out.\u201d\n\nHer journey began with a desire to engage more of the issues of the day in her writing\u2014specifically issues surrounding wrongful incarceration, which she researched extensively during a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard in 2011. But though she became informed, she says she didn\u2019t feel inspired:\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t spark me as an artist, and I think it\u2019s because when it comes to issues like wrongful incarceration, there\u2019s only one side to that story. There\u2019s no other side to it; it\u2019s just wrong. And something with only one side, to me, is not dynamic enough to support 300 pages of a novel; you need ambiguity, you need adventure, you need\u2014just so many things\u2014but I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inspiration often comes in unlikely places. For Jones, it arrived in a mall food court in her native Atlanta when she overheard a couple arguing at a nearby table. Jones took note of the physical differences between the two\u2014the woman was very well put-together, clearly doing better than the man with whom she was engaged in a heart-wrenching discussion within earshot of Jones:\n\nShe said, \u201cRoy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you talkin\u2019 about; this shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u201d... and I thought, that is really, in many ways, the heart of the African-American man-woman disconnect. He needs from her this kind of unconditional support, and she doesn\u2019t believe that if the tables were turned that he would behave the same way. And he feels like, \u201cThese tables don\u2019t turn, so it\u2019s moot!\u201d And I just felt like both of them deserved a full story, and that\u2019s how I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat that overheard conversation inspired is a beautiful and sometimes brutally honest novel about love, loss, hope, redemption, the secrets we keep from those we claim to love, and what Jones feels is the fundamental disconnect and danger facing black heterosexual relationships in a country so deeply invested in both racism and the prison-industrial complex\u2014and, consequently, the effects of wrongful incarceration on relationships, as Jones explained to The Glow Up: \u201cI\u2019m really curious about the residual effects; about what we owe one another; about the way this affects gender dynamics in our community.\u201d\n\nThe title of An American Marriage refers to the union of Roy and Celestial, an upwardly mobile African-American couple whose young marriage is ripped apart by wrongful incarceration\u2014a misidentification that Roy pays for with years of his innocent life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat ensues during those years confronts the reader\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about fidelity, obligation and, most important, love. It also addresses the paradox that can be created when the deep inequities in our justice system intersect with the double standards that often permeate our relationships.\n\nOriginally writing from Celestial\u2019s point of view as a prisoner\u2019s wife, Jones found that her character\u2019s choices and behavior didn\u2019t meet early readers\u2019 expectations. \u201cEveryone [was] upset at the mere concept of this book,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s so often the case when it comes to people looking at women\u2019s responsibilities. Any time you deviate from what they consider to be the norm, then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s so little room for her to be respected in her choices.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging course, she attempted the story from Roy\u2019s perspective as an innocent man behind bars. \u201cWhen I came at it from his point of view, it was more conventional,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel challenging enough, and that\u2019s when I decided to write it from all of their points of view, because you want your book to add to the conversation, not just reiterate a conversation that\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they story told through the lens of not only Roy and Celestial but also members of their immediate family and close friend Andre, who occupies one corner of a love triangle that has perhaps always existed in the couples\u2019s relationship\u2014a relationship complicated by race, disrupted by time and perhaps always destined to challenge convention, as Jones discovered in the writing:\n\nThere are so many novels by white women that involve women trying to break free of the bounds of tradition, but I realized that in the white women\u2019s novels, the man is not in any trouble. So when she frees herself or changes the terms of her marriage, or what have you, because the man isn\u2019t in trouble, you don\u2019t worry about him, so her freedom isn\u2019t tied to anyone else. But with the black situation, the man is in trouble, so that if you reprioritize where his safety is not the first thing, or his care is not the first thing or the only thing on your list, there are consequences, because he actually needs you. And that is what makes Celestial\u2019s situation so complicated, but it\u2019s what makes it different than those other books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the characters Jones has created are realistically flawed, there are no true villains in An American Marriage, only different interpretations of a tragic situation. That ambiguity is what makes the narrative so intriguing from start to finish\u2014though Jones almost didn\u2019t finish, finding herself \u201cstranded\u201d 50 pages from the end. She even began considering career paths other than her role as a professor at Rutgers University because \u201cthree-quarters of a book is the same as no book at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the shore, and I could not get there. Like, someone had stolen my oar, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough An American Marriage is Jones\u2019 fourth published work, she is very clear on the fact that the writing process is overwhelming, especially if you aren\u2019t able to dedicate yourself to it full time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey always tell writers, \u2018Oh, you should write every day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that people need to stop saying that, because I feel that it\u2019s discouraging to busy people\u2014you know, to people who work\u2014working people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones wrote her first book on a desk in her clothes closet\u2014with the clothes still hanging there. She stresses that patience is key: \u201cIf you can put in an hour three times a week, you can write your book. It\u2019ll take you longer, but I just think it\u2019s consistency, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nJones should know; An American Marriage is a six-year labor of love that is well-deserving of the mounting accolades it\u2019s receiving. But it\u2019s a triumph Jones readily shares with the community that has sustained her throughout her writing career:\n\nYou know what has been really delightful about this experience? You know, I\u2019ve been writing a long time, and it\u2019s been beautiful to share this with the people who were reading me all the time. I feel like we did this together. I feel like this victory is ours together. Black women, we don\u2019t throw our people away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as we ended our conversation, Jones also made sure to share the words of her longtime mentor, acclaimed writer and playwright Pearl Cleage:", "keywords": ["know", "marriage", "man", "american", "tayari", "jones", "thats", "novel", "gets", "heart", "book", "matter", "love", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.11714598997493736, "subjectivity": 0.5294200779727095},

It was a speech seemingly intended to touch the heart of the next shooter out there who apparently just needs a hug in order to not murder his classmates.\n\nMind you, if this wasn\u2019t the most divisive president in the history of presidents, then maybe his entreaties for peace and love would make a difference, but he is who he is, so his pleas don\u2019t hold weight and they won\u2019t change anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most glaring part of the speech came at the end, when the president pledged that America must \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d He didn\u2019t say \u201cguns\u201d once in his speech. Trump took pains to make no mention of guns.

Bailey, a black man, was shot, and Griner, a black lesbian, took a bullet in the ankle. She and Scalise were taken to the hospital.\n\nScalise would take almost three months to recover. Last month a battered but not beaten Scalise returned to deliver an emotional speech on the House floor. He was using a walker; his femur was still shattered, and his hip and pelvis still damaged. He joked that the doctors had done a good job putting Humpty Dumpty back together. He talked about getting shot and lying out on the ball field and how he began praying to God. He noted that had it not been for Bailey\u2019s and Griner\u2019s bravery that day, Scalise as well as many others might not be here today. He claimed that the officers were part of his family.\n\nThis is the part of the movie where the curmudgeonly Republican who once billed himself as \u201cDavid Duke without the baggage\u201d would see the error of his ways. The part of the movie where he\u2019s visited by the Ghost of Death and shown what he might have missed out on had the very people he\u2019s been rallying against not been there to save his life. A softening of his heart would occur, and we\u2019d be proud to witness the shedding of his old ways.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, this ain\u2019t the movies, and for all of Scalise\u2019s emotional bullshit, an asshole took a bullet and almost died, but he\u2019s still an asshole. Not only has Scalise confirmed that he\u2019s willing to hobble toward his asshole agenda\u2014no less than a few days after making his return back to Congress\u2014but he\u2019s already stirring up controversial news.\n\nOne would think that after being shot and hearing the horrific news about the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the 52-year-old House majority whip would, at the least, have a slight move on gun control. Wouldn\u2019t he? Well, one would be wrong.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers believed strongly in gun rights for citizens,\u201d Scalise said during a recent appearance on Meet the Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to put new laws in place that don\u2019t fix these problems. They only make it harder for law-abiding citizens to own a gun,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if he believed that the right to bear arms was \u201cunlimited,\u201d Scalise said, \u201cIt is, it is.\u201d\n\nScalise spent at least a month in the hospital undergoing several surgeries to repair his hip and pelvis. He fought off an infection and has undergone hours of rehabilitation just to be able to walk again. Surely this extensive hospital stay would, at the very least, move his needle toward supporting affordable health care, and maybe even toward single-payer, government-provided health insurance, after he realized that his life was spared because he had access to some of the best medical care in the country.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuck no. Scalise is the kind of asshole who has been spared only so he can serve as a mouthpiece against all the things that helped save him. The Hollywood version was too perfect, so instead, this staunch, bigoted Republican who had spent his time in Congress bashing gay rights and was saved by a black lesbian, and then spent months in the hospital receiving the best care money can provide, made a miraculous recovery so that he could limp back into Congress and continue being an asshole.\n\nAs the Washington Blade reported, \u201cScalise has built over the course [of] his tenure in Congress since 2008 among the most anti-LGBT reputations of any lawmaker.\u201d And nothing has changed since he\u2019s been on the mend. The Blade further detailed Scalise\u2019s record before the shooting:\n\n\n\nEarning a \u201c0\u201d on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s congressional scorecard, Scalise voted against \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal and hate crimes protection legislation. In the last Congress, Scalise was among the 130 co-sponsors of the First Amendment Defense Act, a federal \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill seen to enable anti-LGBT discrimination. As a member of House Republican leadership, he\u2019s responsible for the lack of votes on pro-LGBT legislation on the House floor. When Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced an amendment upholding President Obama\u2019s 2014 executive order against anti-LGBT workplace discrimination, Scalise was reportedly among House leaders who convinced seven Republicans to switch their votes to ensure the measure would fail. When a federal judge upheld Louisiana\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage as constitutional in 2014, Scalise hailed the decision during an appearance on the anti-LGBT Family Research Council\u2019s radio program as \u201can important win for marriage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince being saved by a lesbian, Scalise has reassured believers in traditional heterosexual marriage they they have nothing to fear\u2014he still hates gay marriage with the same passion he had before the shooting. He will speak this Friday at the Values Voter Summit hosted by the Family Research Council, a group of conservatives whom the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as an anti-LGBTQ hate group.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m starting to believe that there is no perfect victim, even when the victim is a congressman with the ability to effect change on a judicial level. I\u2019m starting to believe that the deaths of more than 50 innocent people at the hands of a radicalized, American-born and -bred terrorist won\u2019t be enough to move the ball forward. Currently, the debate is not over toughening gun laws or restricting the production of guns; it isn\u2019t even a debate over gun restrictions. The current argument isn\u2019t centered on making semi-automatic weapons inaccessible to citizens; it\u2019s on bump stocks\u2014a device that can make a semi-automatic weapon fire like a machine gun.\n\n\u201cThey want, somehow, some transformational event to happen that\u2019s going to convert somebody\u2019s political viewpoints,\u201d Scalise said in an interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Scalise, we do. Or, if nothing else, we want the tragedy, the personal tragedy of gun violence that almost killed you, to affect you. We want your cold heart to soften around bigoted views. We want you to be ... human.

This poses a problem when senior-level staff with full clearance have to be careful about what information they share with those who have only interim clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of November, more than 130 White House staffers were working without full security clearance.\n\nLast month we also learned that both Porter and White House speechwriter David Sorensen had histories of domestic abuse. This is something that, at least in the case of Porter, could have prevented him from gaining full, permanent clearance.\n\nThe president is presumably allowing people to work with interim clearance, and as of now, we don\u2019t know which of those staffers have since gained full clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican representative who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN last month: \u201cThe security clearance process is critical to keeping America\u2019s secrets. Foreign intelligence services look for vulnerabilities in individuals with access to our most sensitive information. Not following the process is a disservice not only to the individual but to our countries security interests. It\u2019s unusual that so many have taken so long.\u201d\n\nOf course, the White House is tight-lipped about both the security-clearance process and which members of the White House staff and administration do not have full clearance.\n\nStill, we have to question the implications for our national security when even the president himself would not have security clearance if it didn\u2019t automatically come with the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also would not pass a full background check. There are things in his past that would render him ineligible for full security clearance. And yet, there he sits in the Oval Office\u2014with access to our military secrets and the power to launch us into nuclear war.\n\nAs we wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to figure out whether or not Trump obstructed justice and whether or not he was a pawn for the Russians, we need to be worried about who else the president has been running his mouth to.

The egregious act has left authorities baffled as to why he mowed down dozens of concertgoers in yet another mass shooting.\n\nWithout any proof whatsoever, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has speculated that the mass murderer was mentally ill. Others have reasoned that it was probably the result of the anti-anxiety medication Paddock was taking.\n\nUnlike terrorism, drug arrests, traffic stops, gang-related shootings, or other crimes ascribed to people of certain races, ethnicities or religions, no one has made the case that massacres and mass shootings are almost exclusively the territories of white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetween 1982 and 2012, 55.9 percent of the mass shootings in America were committed by white men, according to a detailed list compiled by Mother Jones. Only 16 percent were committed by blacks. But that fact is never mentioned, for one reason:\n\nIndividuality is a white privilege.\n\nThe singularity of whiteness is the main reason Caucasians object to any mention of racism without \u201cNot all white people.\u201d They do not tolerate the collective whiteness that they simultaneously use to excuse mass incarceration, racial profiling, police brutality and the phrase: \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey live with the advantage of not feeling embarrassed by The Real Housewives of Orange County.

Former Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s policy presented no threat to them. The drug war does not affect them. Their daughters are not expelled from school more often when they commit rule infractions.\n\nThe privilege of white individuality makes them immune to the school-to-prison pipeline, mass incarceration, Transportation Security Administration searches, school underfunding, banks charging higher interest rates, employers eliminating them because of the name on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, or the countless other presuppositions that blacks, Hispanics and Muslims live with every day.\n\nIt must be nice.\n\nIt must be nice to walk into a high-end store and not raise suspicion.

Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the high school that her daughter and Nicholas attended, warning the administrator of the violent account, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also staged an intervention with her daughter, seemingly convincing her to break up with the 17-year-old boy. Days later, Nicholas would kill her and her husband, Scott Fricker, in their home in Reston, Va., according to police.\n\nNow HuffPost has revealed the Twitter account Nicholas reportedly used, providing stark details about the nature of his beliefs and inspirations. The Twitter handle, @doctorpepper35, under the name Kevin Gallo, has since been suspended, but the HuffPost article contains several screenshot captures from the account.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nAlmost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Va., praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce\u2019s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicholas saved the worst attacks for Jews, Muslims and members of the LGTBQ community:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I\u2019m working on another 2 \ud83d\ude33,\u201d he bragged. Then he posted a rainbow lynching image, encouraging gay and transgender people to commit suicide. \u201c#transrightsarehumanrights is an oxymoron because trannies aren\u2019t \u2018people,\u2019\u201d Giampa tweeted that day.\ufeff\n\nAnd this:\n\nA white Europe without Jewish or Muslim individuals \u201csounds like heaven,\u201d Giampa tweeted on Nov. 11. The next day, he tweeted \u201cThe jews are everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. \u201cMuslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs HuffPost shows, leading up to the double murder, Nicholas openly identified as a Nazi, retweeted pro-Hitler memes, and called for various neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups to come together as part of a \u201cwhite revolution.\u201d\n\nHis social media track record is disturbing, but in a way that has become increasingly familiar.\n\nThis is the part of the HuffPost report that has me messed up:\n\n\u201cI apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,\u201d said one of Giampa\u2019s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. \u201cIn the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood. A young man whose mother, who reportedly voiced support for Confederate generals and monuments on her Facebook page, took her son to a gun range to fire a submachine gun. A young man who unabashedly praised murderers and dictators and called for race wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some psychiatrists who believe that \u201cextreme racism\u201d is, in fact, a mental illness. But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["white", "huffpost", "disturbing", "gun", "tied", "charged", "murder", "tweeted", "twitter", "jews", "heres", "illness", "identifies", "nicholas", "nationalist", "mental", "young", "teen", "neonazi"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

My eyes see very clearly the racial dynamics at play here, how yet again someone deemed Black bodies a threat and took it upon themselves to perform an act of terrorism on them. This has handicapped my faith in humanity. But my heart is not looking at the news, it is looking up in the sky, where I\u2019m told Heaven is.\n\nFor those of us who go to church, part of the reason we do so is because we want to believe we will be inspired to be better people who contribute to a better world. We also go to strengthen our faith in the power of God\u2019s love and ask that it keep us safe. But now I wonder where his power WAS that night. I may never know the answer, so instead I\u2019ve been asking him a different question:\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\nFrom the moment we heard the news about nine people being shot during bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, we have been told to pray for them, for Mother\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where the shooting took place, for the families of the victims, and for the survivors. The tweegrams with scripture, the Facebook statuses and Tweets telling us to pray. I\u2019ve seen them and never have they felt so hollow, so worthless. The sad irony of the \"pray for Charleston\" message is those folks were already praying, and they were killed while doing so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pray for you\u201d is a common phrase we hear and say whenever we\u2019re confronted with tragedy. Sometimes, we ask people to do the same for us. I say these things and I ask for them too because all my life I have been told to believe in the power of prayer. All my life I have believed in that power. The nine people who were killed in their home of worship, they believed in the power of prayer too, probably more than most. After all, that\u2019s why they were there on a Wednesday, probably just getting off of work. That kind of dedication usually comes from people who have a deep desire to connect with Christ through prayer. They\u2019re either there to study the good book or because they just needed their spiritual batteries recharged. I too have been to many mid-week services simply because I needed to call on God to help me make it to Sunday.\n\nThose nine people did not make it to Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice sentiment to tell people we will pray for them. I encourage anyone who feels compelled to do so to go ahead and say as much out loud, but do not be surprised if some people question its worth because they are thinking about the nine people who were killed while praying. I will not stop praying either. But, if I\u2019m being honest, it\u2019s getting harder to do so these days. I am not afraid to go to church on Sunday, but if I\u2019m being honest, I wonder what good it will do. In the book of James, chapter 2, verse 17 it says: \u201cFaith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead\u2026\u201d And yet, people who were doing the work to strengthen their faith on a Wednesday evening, were killed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelieve me, these thoughts are not a damnation on God\u2019s power. Rather, they stem from the mind of someone whose belief in God and his power has always been innate. But my relationship with God is not immune to the ups and downs of any relationship I have with my loved ones here on Earth. I don\u2019t think anyone can go through life and see all its ills without wondering if the devil is sometimes winning the war between good and evil. That is why I will never tell anyone to stop praying, but after what happened this week, I have two questions for all of us who do: How do we keep our faith and how do we keep praying?", "keywords": ["praying", "pray", "faith", "im", "life", "prayer", "say", "told", "tell", "power", "charleston", "questioning"], "polarity": 0.13145992895992897, "subjectivity": 0.4991361416361416},

He called every news station that would listen to him and went on a full college-boy temper tantrum. Seriously, he spoke to the Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN, Vox, Yahoo! and some local New York news channel called Spectrum News NY1. It was the latter interview in which he called White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, aka Suckabee, a fat slob.\n\nFor the better half of the evening news cycle, Nunberg went full bizarro Oprah and gave everybody a car (if the car was a sad public rant about how he won\u2019t be doing anything required by the subpoena from special counselor Robert Mueller in the Trump Russia investigation).\n\nIf Nunberg weren\u2019t so damn full of himself, it would have been a public meltdown, and maybe it still was, but it wasn\u2019t a sympathetic plea from a beaten man\u2014this was a full-on Kanye-midshow stream of consciousness rant that Nunberg himself was in on.\n\n\u201cLike, how ballsy is this?\u201d Nunberg gloated during his interview with Yahoo! Finance. \u201cThis is like Donald Trump Roger Stone. Right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the best hits from Nunberg\u2019s media blitz:\n\n\u201cDo you think I would ever talk to that moron?\u201d Nunberg said of former Trump staffer Carter Page, who, he added, most likely colluded with the Russians.\n\n\n\n\u201cI came up with the wall, I came up with the Muslim ban, I came up with everything to attack Jeb Bush, all that stuff.\u201d Nunberg also came up with orange face paint used by the president in the morning, and safe words like \u201cnanu butter\u201d if the media is getting too close to Russian collusion.\n\n\n\n\u201cScrew that! Why do I have to go? Why? For what?\u201d This was Nunberg\u2019s position on a subpoena. May we all be this bold some day.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrump may have very well done something during the election with the Russians.\u201d Yep, Nunberg just dropped this little jewel in the middle of his rant, because just like his idol Kanye, in between the nonsensical shit are bits of truth telling.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump caused this because he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Nunberg said, referring to the Russia investigation, Business Insider reports. \u201cHe decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey, and then he decided to have Russians in the Oval Office. You\u2019ll have to explain to me because I\u2019ll never understand it.\u201d\n\n\n\nArguably the best line: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get sent to prison!\u201d Umm, I don\u2019t know how right you are about this one, Nunberg, but I like your moxie.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNunberg was so off the rails that CNN anchor Erin Burnett asked him if he\u2019d been drinking.\n\nBurnett asked him if he\u2019d had anything else, you know, besides alcohol. To which Nunberg replied: \u201cNo. Besides my meds ... antidepressants ... is that OK?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m still confused about it all. I don\u2019t know if Nunberg is failing spectacularly or winning miserably, but either way I admire his white-boy elitism that allows him to thumb his nose at the special counsel.

It\u2019s not a cold. But it is one thing\u2014a jerk. Just the biggest jerk of a disease ruining my social life by forcing me to be actually antisocial, much like the name of this column.\n\nAntisocial is the events-and-society column for people allergic to society, aka those with social anxiety disorder, so it\u2019s not as if I needed an actual disease to give me a reason to stay home.

So many Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference panels and events in Washington, D.C. All missed because I was too busy hacking and coughing in my prison of used Kleenex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is my first time being ill in more than two years, ruining my pristine streak of good health, all of which was fueled (mostly) by a flu shot I took back in 2015 and some really good luck, considering that New York City is a germophobe\u2019s nightmare fuel. I\u2019m supposed to travel back to D.C. later this week for my 40th birthday, but the way this sickness is going, who knows what will happen come Friday? Can I even travel? I could\u2019ve almost died in my hotel room during CBC week because I choked on a cold tablet that got lodged in my throat.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of my more than 18 days of sinus infection, I decided to take a break from being sick and pretended to be well because I didn\u2019t want to miss the Black & White Champagne Brunch with the New York Urban League at La Marina in New York City on Sept. 16.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 200 people gathered for the brunch, which was hosted by actress and body-positive advocate RaVal Davis. Charter Communications Vice President of State Government Affairs Camile Joseph Goldman was being honored with the David N. Dinkins Award for Service, Leadership and Social Justice at the event, which also featured performances by NAACP Theater Award-winning actress and singer Sha\u2019Leah Nikole.\n\nShe performed Roberta Flack\u2019s classic by way of the Fugees, \u201cKilling Me Softly,\u201d as I ate eggs and bacon, feeling proud of my ability to actually throw together a halfway decent outfit that didn\u2019t make me feel that I unnecessarily stood out in a bad way, but still blended in with the overall theme of everyone in black and white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemarks were made by NYUL President and CEO Arva R. Rice and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), as well as Goldman, who gave a spirited and impassioned speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was mostly thankful that it wasn\u2019t a dreaded \u201cwhite party\u201d (black people love white parties, where you dress in all white, get turnt and look like drunken angels), because I hate wearing all white with a passion. The absence of color does nothing for my complexion and is almost as dreaded as wearing all black, which makes me look like I (still) work at Macy\u2019s.\n\n\n\nPer usual, I had no business cards on me because they were still in the mail at the time and my old cards were lost more than a year ago in my move to New York City. (They did show up in time for CBC week, meaning that a bunch of people now have my work number, filling me with a special kind of anxiety.)\n\nThis made me garner a look from New York society columnist Audrey J. Bernard, whom I\u2019d watched chastise a young woman who approached me a few weeks ago at a New York Fashion Week event wanting to write for The Root and had no business cards. To be honest, I find that when I receive business cards, I never do absolutely anything with them unless the person is someone I\u2019m desperately, constantly forgetting the name of. Then I hold on to the card as if I\u2019m hoping the name will be absorbed into my porous brain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m notoriously bad with names. Chances are, if you know me and I know you but we\u2019re not close enough to be besties, I don\u2019t actually know your name even though I\u2019ve met you several times, seen you at multiple events and recognize you easily. I used to have a publisher, Virginia Moorhouse\u2014whose family owns the Bakersfield Californian newspaper, where I worked for five years\u2014who was fantastic at remembering everyone\u2019s name, an incredible, enviable skill.\n\nI try all the tricks, repeating the name back to them, introducing them to friends so they have to say their name\u2014nothing really works except for this one time when I ran into a guy (who also probably didn\u2019t know my name, either, to be honest) in the airport and I remembered his entire life story but not his name, so I went home and furiously Googled his job and searched for his name and picture until it popped up, then just kept walking around my apartment, repeating the name back to myself like a lunatic.\n\nWhich brings me to CBC in Washington, where I was talking to Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Panama Jackson, a senior editor here at The Root, and he was also complaining about how he knew no one\u2019s name. How he would know people, kick it with people at parties and still have no idea what they\u2019re called. He wondered if something was wrong with him or if he was just self-centered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI told him I was the same way and that he was likely just self-centered, since I\u2019m sure that is my issue. I\u2019m often too busy thinking about whatever the personal malady of the day is to know what anyone\u2019s name is, lost in my own head. I may be present with you in the moment, talking, smiling, laughing, but am I really there? Or am I lost in my own head, wondering about this and that? It\u2019s annoying and probably one of my least favorite things about myself. I want to be in the moment, but I\u2019m easily distracted by my own internal drama.\n\nEvery year for the past 47 years, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has thrown a conference in D.C. that attracts thousands of black people from across the nation to talk policy and community issues, then fight to get into many of the exclusive parties going on around the main event. I was too sick for most of the conference, barely making it through panels\u2014faring poorly with a panel The Root\u2019s Jason Johnson and Panama were on about the importance of the black press, but faring a bit better during a panel on the film Black Panther that featured director Ryan Coogler and an exclusive five-minute clip from the film.\n\nI spent most of the conference just trying not to die, but managed to pull it together for a discussion between St. Louis\u2019 own, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) (she\u2019s from Kinloch, Mo., to be precise), and BET\u2019s newest late-night talk show host, Robin Thede, soon to be starring in The Rundown With Robin Thede.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was excited to attend this event and to meet Robin because we have something in common: We were both black-lady head writers for late-night talk shows\u2014she is formerly of Larry Wilmore\u2019s show on Comedy Central, and I am formerly of BET\u2019s previous late-night outing Don\u2019t Sleep Hosted by T.J. Holmes.\n\nMy foray into late-night TV was very (very!) short-lived. The show lasted only four months back in 2012. T.J. has since moved on to Good Morning America on ABC, and I\u2019m obviously here at The Root, holding it down. I wished Robin all the best with her show (and told her I\u2019d love to do a feature on her for The Root), and judging by how well she handled her interview with Waters\u2014it was funny and insightful\u2014I have a feeling she might last much, much longer than our four months of ratings-based struggle! (But we did get this sweet write-up in the New York Times!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for all the other activities that happened during CBC, I left all of those for everyone else to enjoy, since I spent nearly every night in my hotel room quietly wondering why I traveled to D.C. while sick on a germ-filled Amtrak train, resickening myself and making my illness worse. I left all the real partying to my friend Jason, who did all the things I would have done had I been well\u2014like be bold enough to crash parties I wasn\u2019t invited to in order to see T.I. and Babyface perform at separate galas. I ended up giving away my ticket to the coveted Black Party (hosted by La La Anthony and featuring Doug E. Fresh) to my best friend, Jada Prather, so I could go back to my hotel and die.\n\nSpeaking of dying, I almost did! The following morning, I attempted to take some cold medication and choked on the pill. It got caught up in my throat and would NOT dislodge despite all the coughing, hacking and vomiting I did. Fearing that I would die, I called the front desk and attempted to tell them, \u201cSend help, I\u2019m choking!\u201d For some reason, they misinterpreted this but did send up a gentleman who, upon looking at me hacking and coughing with mucus running from my nose, took off running in the other direction, shouting on his walkie-talkie to the front desk. I was hoping he\u2019d help me out with a Heimlich or something, but no.\n\nSo I was left gagging and contemplating whether this was the end. That the sum of my life would conclude with me asphyxiating on a very large DayQuil gel cap, in a T-shirt and underwear, in a hotel room in D.C. All I kept thinking was, \u201cThis is a stupid, stupid way to die.\u201d I also thought a lot about the HBO show Six Feet Under, which had an episode once in which a woman choked to death on food in her apartment, and how I always feared this happening to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I thought about dying, my father, Six Feet Under and how dumb this was. A dumb way to die. I couldn\u2019t die like this. I had to calm down and attempt to breath through all the coughing and heaving so I wouldn\u2019t black out.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, the pill started to break down and dissolve in my throat, probably from all the vomiting of stomach acid (it was very early in the morning and I hadn\u2019t eaten yet). The hotel sent several more people up to my room to check on me, including the paramedics, who had been told that someone \u201cfell.\u201d I was like, \u201cNah, I was choking.\u201d So the paramedics cracked a few jokes and left.\n\nAfter everyone determined that no one had died at the Hyatt Place in \u201cNoMa\u201d (lol at that name), I was left to my own devices, whereupon I sat in my room and cried until Jason called me and invited me to breakfast, where I recounted to him my brush with death in a hoarse voice that could barely get out words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, I ate this Breakfast Bandit bagel sandwich at Buffalo & Bergen in Union Market.\n\nIt was delicious, but I was still teary and miserable, and I wanted to document the first thing I attempted to eat after almost dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeemed important.\n\nThankfully, I am not dead, but still on the mend from my illness. I have a whole spate of events lined up in October that I will hopefully be much more healthy and present for. Hopefully. Maybe. Perhaps. Ideally.\n\nBut for now, just trying not to die while taking this cold medication.", "keywords": ["white", "know", "hotel", "went", "foundations", "urban", "dc", "im", "die", "black", "leagues", "way", "ny", "room", "sick", "socialize", "york"], "polarity": 0.07901404598985247, "subjectivity": 0.45319120544926994},

Earlier this month, Oprah Winfrey paid tribute to Taylor in a rousing Golden Globes speech that has been watched at least 9 million times.\n\nBut Winfrey wasn\u2019t done paying homage to the civil rights pioneer.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Winfrey posted a photo to her Instagram account showing her at Taylor\u2019s gravesite in Abbeville, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences, but if I did, this would be a powerful one,\u201d Winfrey wrote. \u201cOn assignment for 60 Minutes, I end up in the town of Abbeville, where Recy Taylor suffered injustice, endured and recently died.\u201d\n\nWinfrey expressed gratitude for being able to visit her grave \u201cso soon after \u2018speaking her name.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press about why the visit meant a lot to her, Winfrey noted that she didn\u2019t even know who Taylor was until a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I wanted to use her as a part of my Golden Globes speech is I wanted everybody to know that the #MeToo movement didn\u2019t just start now,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cThere have been women who have endured, women who have not only survived but thrived in the face of injustices for years.

Omar Delgado, one of the first police to respond to the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, is losing his job.\n\nHailed as a hero in the wake of the June 2016 mass shooting for saving the life of shooting victim Angel Colon, Delgado has since suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. As the Orlando Sentinel reports, after the massacre that left 49 people dead, Delgado returned to patrol duty with the Eatonville, Fla., Police Department for a few months but had to stop.\n\nHe told CNN that he has had trouble sleeping and suffered from nightmares, depression and anxiety. Delgado eventually took a desk job with the department, performing administrative duties for the past eight months.\n\nThen, this past Monday, the Eatonville PD told Delgado that his last day would be at the end of the month. Delgado is not sure exactly why he\u2019s being let go, and city officials wouldn\u2019t comment on the case, citing privacy policies. The officer says that a doctor had found him unfit to resume full duties because of his PTSD, which he believes was a factor in the city\u2019s decision to fire him.\n\nBut Delgado\u2014a nine-and-a-half-year veteran of the department\u2014is being forced out just six months before he can receive his full retirement pension and disability benefits. If he made the 10-year mark, the 45-year-old officer could receive 64 percent of his salary and benefits for life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timing of Delgado\u2019s firing, however, means that Delgado is entitled to disability or a retirement pension, but not both, according to WESH-TV. As it stands, Delgado will only receive 42 percent of his salary (his disability pension), which will kick in when he turns 55.\n\nDelgado said that the departmental policy was news to him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be a police officer with my gun belt and so forth to do those little tasks,\u201d Delgado said about his administrative work. \u201cCould they have let me do that for six more months? That\u2019s the debate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Time magazine notes, Delgado isn\u2019t the first officer who responded to the Pulse-nightclub shooting to be fired following a PTSD diagnosis. The Orlando Police Department let go Officer Gerry Realin, 37, in July. However, Realin will receive 80 percent of his $70,000 salary each year for the rest of life. Compare that with Delgado, who stands to receive 42 percent of his $38,5000 salary annually.\n\nBut Eatonville, the home of Zora Neale Hurston and the oldest incorporated African-American town in the country, is reportedly strapped for cash. The Eatonville Town Council, following a harsh backlash to news of Delgado\u2019s firing (WESH-TV reports that city officials have received death threats), voted unanimously to give Delgado an additional $1,200. The city also said that it would continue to help the officer with PTSD counseling.\n\nA blog posted on Psychology Today says that out of roughly 900,000 sworn officers in the U.S., approximately 19 percent may have PTSD. Some research also suggests that another 34 percent of law enforcement officers may suffer from symptoms of PTSD but \u201cdo not meet the standards for the full diagnosis.\u201d (Note: This blog also tells us to take time to \u201csmile at a cop,\u201d since their jobs are so stressful, which is cute but also horseshit. Cops suffering from PTSD need real institutional support, and it\u2019s unclear whether Delgado really received it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, PTSD is not covered by workers\u2019 compensation in Florida. As the Orlando Sentinel notes, a proposed bill requiring first responders with PTSD to receive coverage for mental health treatment in their workers\u2019 compensation packages advanced this week in the Florida Senate.\n\nAngel Colon, the man whose life Delgado saved last year, told Fox 35 that the Eatonville Police Department should support the veteran officer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible feeling because this man, Omar, has been there for me ever since June 12,\u201d Colon said, according to the Sentinel. \u201cHe\u2019s the person who saved my life.\u201d", "keywords": ["pension", "cop", "pulse", "eatonville", "life", "massacre", "orlando", "officer", "delgado", "months", "lose", "receive", "ptsd", "job", "suffering", "salary"], "polarity": 0.020723684210526307, "subjectivity": 0.3847953216374269},

In its report, the GAO made its assessment of MWO-firm access to all of them.\n\nFederal employees pay into federal plans from their salaries during their careers, and asset managers invest funds so that they build equity. Some of these entities include the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Federal Reserve System and the National Railway Retirement Investment Trust. Representatives from the GAO interviewed decision-makers from these entities to determine how well they were working to create opportunities for minority- and women-owned asset-management firms.\n\nVerdict: not good at all.\n\nIn some instances, none of the plans used MWO firms. Others used vey few. At BlackRock, a publicly traded asset-management firm that oversees three federal plans, just 1.6 percent of its managers are African American, while 81.5 percent are white; 13.5 percent are Asian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the reasons minority- or women-owned businesses don\u2019t get as much of the asset-management pie is that, unless an entity specifically asks for a minority- or women-owned firm, consultants tasked with job searches will not even consider them, according to the report. Another issue is that there is a bias against using MWO firms because it is assumed that they will not perform as well as white ones, even though there is no data backing up that assumption, the report found. The GAO cited industry studies that reveal there is no difference between the performance of an MWO and a non-MWO firm.\n\nThe lack of opportunities that minority-owned firms get to handle federally managed dollars should concern Congress and Americans in general, said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\n\n\u201cFederal employees are paying into this, and federal employees reflect the wonderful diversity of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you have high-quality, strong-performing [asset] managers who don\u2019t give [MWO firms] a shot to manage some of these funds, it flies in the face of our values as a nation of equal opportunities and inclusion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Booker arrived in Washington in 2013, tackling asset-management diversity in contracting was one of the first issues he took on. A year later, he and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) held a summit with pension-fund administrators to find out why there were so few MWO firms getting a shot to manage federal assets.\n\nOne issue is that the process of how to apply for contracts is not very clear or made readily available to prospective minority-owned firms. Firm size is another challenge. Institutional investors often require firms to have a minimum of threshold assets under management\u2014usually $1 billion, at the very least; liability insurance; as well as lengthy track records that smaller firms usually do not have.\n\nBut the dearth of ethnic and gender diversity is not the only issue with having federal assets managed by a select few firms. A major concern for Meeks is the potential for a security breach of a firm managing a lion\u2019s share of assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have a cyber breach of that firm, it would impact all of the federal employees,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cBut if you broke it down so that you had many small firms, it would not have an effect over the broad scope of everyone, and it better diversifies what those risks may be.\u201d\n\nAs bleak as the report\u2019s findings were, there were some recommendations for improvement. Federal investment entities could create minority-centered competitions that are marketed to firms that historically have been excluded from federal bidding. Adjusting high thresholds for assets under management, liability insurance and years of management experience would ensure that smaller firms were eligible to apply.\n\nThe report emphasized that the leadership of pension funds and various government plans has to prioritize diversity, and the consultants hired to search for asset managers have to diversify their Rolodexes beyond their typical recruiting pools. Meeks stressed that adjusting these thresholds isn\u2019t the same as lowering standards. To the contrary, it is about access to the bidding process that is proportionate to a firm, regardless of size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked what he and his colleagues would do to ensure that MWO firms get federal asset-management jobs in the future, Booker said that he would continue challenging fund administrators to accept the GAO\u2019s recommendations on diversifying the firms that are handing their assets.\n\n\u201cIf they have such little amounts of diversity or do not have a [diversity] program, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe more we can shine a light on the problem and demonstrate there are constructive things they could be doing, the more quickly we\u2019re going to see changes being made.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["report", "assetmanagement", "mwo", "federal", "contracts", "getting", "firms", "firm", "diversity", "plans", "minority", "meeks"], "polarity": 0.026336545399045397, "subjectivity": 0.3772763000888001},

Like any label, it\u2019s layered and nuanced.\n\n\n\nEvery few years, the American Psychiatric Association publishes a manual for diagnosing mental disorders.

Many we don\u2019t know: functional neurological symptom disorder?\n\n\n\nIf you look through all of the definitions, you\u2019ll see how ridiculous it is to reach into that grab bag for a random diagnosis for anyone who commits an unspeakable crime.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(And even if we want to brand him a simple, garden-variety psychopath, please note that psychopathy isn\u2019t considered a mental disorder, and even if it were, he doesn\u2019t fit the profile, at least not right now.)\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about what mental illness is\u2014and isn\u2019t. No longer can we just envision hospitals and straitjackets and needles and lobotomies. Medication and therapy and alternative medications and exercise and diet and misdiagnoses of all kinds are part of the story. But mass killings? Not necessarily. For a better understanding of the typical mental-health story, you can envision \u2026 me.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m a resident of what I like to call Crazytown. And my block is a relatively boring place in the neighborhood. I need therapy and meds. Shit can get hectic if I\u2019m not diligent about both. Before finding the right doctors and meds, I was a mess. All in all, pretty simple stuff.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about you. Or maybe someone you know. Know anyone with insomnia? Alzheimer\u2019s? Maybe someone who is a hoarder or has OCD? Do you know folks who have anxiety or maybe bite their nails? All of those items are in the DSM-5 because mental disorders are multifaceted, and 1 in 5 Americans live here in my city.\n\n\n\nAll of those people aren\u2019t in the category of Stephen Paddock.

Bush and a current professor at Georgetown University Law Center, was nominated by President Donald Trump this week to sit on a federal commission that sets policy on how to punish criminals.\n\nIt would come as no surprise that Otis is a staunch supporter of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 hard-line approach of imposing mandatory minimum sentences and resurrecting the war on drugs. But Otis, thanks to his popular legal blog, Crime and Consequences, has also made his racist beliefs both explicit and easily searchable.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, Otis once defended a federal judge who was called out for saying that black and Latinx people were more violent than white people.\n\nIn a 2013 post he titled, \u201cThe PC Attempt to Intimidate Judges,\u201d Otis wrote:\n\nWhen Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites, a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. ... The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were \u201cdiscriminatory and biased.\u201d So far as I have been able to discover, it makes no mention of the fact that they\u2019re true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post noted, Otis dug himself further into the racist-commentary trenches in the comments section, where Otis saw fit to compare black people to Asians, whom he called \u201cOrientals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrientals,\u201d Otis claimed, have a lower incidence of crime than other groups because they have the right values. Here is that passage in full:\n\nThis is the reason that, for example, Orientals have less incidence of crime than whites. Orientals were unquestionably the victims of long and rancid racial bigotry; coolie labor was little more than slave labor. And Yick Wo v. Hopkins is one of the most famous civil rights cases of all time. The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, of course, is flatly ahistorical. While Asian groups have certainly been discriminated against, that treatment simply cannot be compared to the history of anti-black racism in the U.S. \u201cCoolie labor,\u201d as Otis puts it (the term is dated and derogatory, and refers to Asian laborers) is not comparable to over 200 years of chattel slavery.\n\nIn the same post, Otis also flatly denied that white people\u2019s racial bigotry caused black people to \u201cmake ... more criminal choices.\u201d\n\nAs if trying to hit all the twisted, racist lines of \u201clogic\u201d that he could, Otis next brought up Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as his example of a good black person with the \u201cright values\u201d:\n\nValues, not race or skin color, influence choices. Some of the bravest men in public life \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas comes to mind \u2014 had the \u201cwrong\u201d skin color but the right values (see Thomas\u2019s autobiography, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son\u201d). They made honorable and courageous choices, and succeeded. This is one of the reasons the grievance-monger crowd \u2014 the people who now want to hammer Judge Jones \u2014 have a special hate for Justice Thomas.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Thomas\u2019 values apparently include perjury and harassment of women apparently evaded the Georgetown law professor.\n\nThe Post also found another blog from 2014 in which Otis referred to an offender sarcastically as \u201cMr. Nicey.\u201d The post was written in response to a bill called the \u201cSmarter Sentencing Act\u201d that would have reduced sentences for some drug and low-level offenders.\n\nHere\u2019s what he wrote:\n\nLast I looked, when you needle yourself with too much heroin, you\u2019re still dead; when a thug belts you to grab your purse, you still have a knot on your head and no purse; and when Mr. Nicey rapes your eight year-old, you still have a defiled little girl to try to help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bears repeating: Trump\u2019s pick for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which determines what criminal sentences to dole out, has written that black and Latinx people commit more crimes because of their collective substandard values, and appears to think that selling an eighth of an ounce of weed (a low-level offense) is akin to child rape.\n\nThe comments that Otis has made on his blog aren\u2019t racist dog whistles. They\u2019re the air horn of racism. They\u2019re also terrifyingly recent\u2014all made within the last five years.\n\nOtis\u2019 nomination was announced on Thursday and is one of four that Trump made.

These people and several hundred others were allegedly shot by 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as he took position on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel and fired thousands of rounds down on concertgoers during a Jason Aldean show.\n\n\n\nToday, as well as in the coming days and weeks, the conversation will turn to the role that the availability of high-powered weapons has on America\u2019s unique predilection for mass shootings. Just this afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s primary propagandist and agent of misinformation, declared today to be too soon to talk gun control before pivoting, midbreath, to blow a Chicago dog whistle. There have been and will continue to be very passionate rebukes of Sanders and Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association and white maleness, and very smart people will offer possible solutions to this unsolvable problem.\n\nAnd then, when another mass shooting happens next month or next year or tomorrow in Austin, Texas, or Youngstown, Ohio, or Durham, N.C., or Denver, the same thing will happen again. Nothing will change.\n\nIt\u2019s with this context that I\u2019m left to wonder exactly how many white people would have to die in a mass shooting before America\u2019s collective will to stop this from happening again would surpass its zeal and yearning for guns. Which number would serve as the critical mass?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know, after Sandy Hook, that the deaths of 20 young schoolchildren weren\u2019t enough. And if the senseless murder of children affects us, I don\u2019t know, 10 times as much as the murders of adults do, then we can extrapolate and presume that 200 people murdered in a mass shooting wouldn\u2019t be enough, either.\n\n\n\nAlso, it\u2019s no accident that the headline of this piece includes a qualifier for whiteness. It\u2019s there because we know exactly how many black people would have to die in a mass shooting before America decided to give a shit about gun control. If there are roughly 40 million black people here, then roughly 40 million black people would have to die. Then, of course, the NRA\u2019s need to be a source of white identification\u2014and the aggressively white affinity to possess the ability to stockpile killing machines\u2014would no longer exist. No need for night-lights if all the bogeymen are dead.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, what is the number? 250? 500? 600? 1,300? 2,200? 57,000?

Through his social media posts, it was clear to me that Wade was charismatic, unassuming and bright and navigated the world in a very self-assured way. What was also evident was his genuine love for people and for his community. Put simply, Wade was a star who was wise beyond his years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, he also became a victim of gun violence and was taken from us this past Thanksgiving holiday weekend.\n\nAccording to KPRC Click2Houston, Wade and 29-year-old Mario Jerrell Williams reportedly got into a heated argument. A witness reported seeing Williams leave the bedroom of Wade\u2019s home in Atascocita, Texas, apparently upset. The witness told investigators that Williams wanted to talk to Wade, but Wade had asked him repeatedly to leave, which he finally did, according to the police report.\n\nWilliams returned, and moments later, the witness heard two gunshots and ran out, only to see Wade\u2019s twin brother, Stephen, asking someone to call 911, KPRC reports. Williams later turned himself in to the police and is currently being held at Harris County Jail in Texas on $100,000 bond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon after his death, many media outlets began framing this killing as a violent lover\u2019s quarrel\u2014a crime of passion, perhaps. I will never forget sitting in criminal law and procedure classes in 2009, as a first-year law student, thinking about the nonsense of certain \u201ccrimes of passion.\u201d\n\nSome crimes of passion are deeply connected to possession, ownership, jealousy and ideas of romanticism. None of that is truly connected to passion, and it certainly isn\u2019t connected to love\u2014not the kind any of us should find to be true, anyway. Society owes it to all people to do a better job of discussing the ways that intimate-partner violence (pdf) affects all communities, but especially ones that are often forgotten, like black queer and transgender populations.\n\nStill, Wade\u2019s close friends make clear that what\u2019s most important is how we\u2014as writers, academics and folks at the margins\u2014frame how he lived, especially when mainstream media may find it more valuable to sensationalize how he died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Wade\u2019s life reminds us of the importance of calling into question love, romance and desire in black queerdom. He reminds us of the critical dialogue we should have on how toxic masculinity and patriarchy become increasingly dangerous when compounded with feelings of unrequited love and attraction. His life and death call to attention the ways in which violence cannot be viewed through a narrow prism when we\u2019re considering the intersections of blackness and queerness.\n\nBut that is not the extent of his legacy. Wade worked fervently so that those without a \u201cbright future\u201d\u2014individuals who often fall between the cracks of mass incarceration, poverty, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia\u2014would not be forgotten.\n\nThat memory should not be erased.\n\n\u201cDevon Wade was a force, an angel amongst men. He was a gentle spirit, who generated electricity in all spaces he dwelled,\u201d said Jeffrey McCune of Washington University in St. Louis, a mentor and friend to Wade. \u201cHis life\u2019s work, examining the impact of incarcerated parents on children, was to be a shape-shifter to the sociology of education. He is sorely missed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade understood firsthand the direct impact that mass incarceration had on young people and families. As he was growing up, both his mother and father were in prison, so he was raised by his grandparents. But from all accounts, instead of blaming his parents, he realized their personal struggles and he decided to tackle oppressive systems\u2014such as the prison-industrial complex\u2014and how they affect black communities.\n\nWhile a student at M.B. Smiley High School, Wade enrolled in No More Victims, a program for young people whose parents are incarcerated. Wade eventually became an honors graduate at Louisiana State University, a Harry S. Truman scholar and then a doctoral student at Columbia in New York City, studying sociology. He talked about these experiences often, how they collectively shaped his work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and how he had to unpack his own trauma.\n\nIn the YouTube clip \u201cWho Is: Devon Tyrone Wade,\u201d Wade noted, \u201cI had not yet necessarily had that conversation with my parents about what their being in prison meant for me. And even though I had in most cases excelled \u2026 there were a whole host of things that impacted me in ways I kept inside.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, not only was Wade able to find his own voice, but he was also able to empower others to find theirs.\n\n\n\nWade\u2019s work was focused on not just what happens when we lock up individuals but also what happens to their families. What happens to those communities? What happens to returning citizens once they are released from prison? Wade wanted to create a society that allowed for the most marginalized to survive and thrive by providing resources and also by understanding how trauma is punished for already at-risk youths.\n\n\u201cWhat we will miss from [Wade] is that he speaks assuredly but not abrasively so. He is inclusive, welcoming, warm and wanted his work to extend beyond nonacademics,\u201d close friend and colleague Adam Smith told The Root. \u201cHe wanted to make sure his work was not just contributing to the research but to the people that needed it the most.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWade was a budding scholar, a critical thinker and a person known by everyone to show compassion for marginalized communities. He was taken from us by way of gun violence, despite doing what society told us was \u201cright.\u201d Although we can\u2019t bring Wade back, we must continue passing the torch by uplifting often-forgotten people, the alleged downtrodden, those whom society further pushes into the margins.\n\nWhat happened to Wade shouldn\u2019t have happened. He should still be with us and those who loved him most in the world. It is now our responsibility to continue pushing and thinking of collateral consequences of the prison-industrial complex and policing of neighborhoods, and make sure that his life\u2019s work was not in vain.", "keywords": ["parents", "williams", "wade", "work", "violence", "remembered", "died", "wanted", "student", "devon", "society", "wades", "ways", "disrupting", "merely", "prison", "pipeline"], "polarity": 0.1564536066343295, "subjectivity": 0.5571249500165161},

My daughter isn\u2019t actually 2 years old yet. She\u2019ll be 2 next month. But I remember, before she was born, making fun of parents who\u2019d tell you their child\u2019s age in months instead of years. And then I became one of those parents. So today, this is me attempting (and likely failing) not to be a hypocrite.\n\nParenthood, so far, has been an anthology of those moments: a salmagundi of shit you said you\u2019d never do and thought you\u2019d never do and find yourself doing. Saturday morning, for instance, my daughter and I choreographed a dance to the \u201cElmo\u2019s World\u201d theme song. I\u2019m a slightly better-than-terrible dancer, and she\u2019s 23 months old, so it wasn\u2019t a complicated dance. It was basically just a pared-down version of the cabbage patch. But if you had told me 10 years ago that I\u2019d be caught cabbage-patching to Elmo, I\u2019d first wonder why you had such an arbitrarily specific vision of my future. And then I\u2019d ask who kidnapped me because this act must clearly be something my captors are forcing me to do.\n\nI also never thought a tiny person who still sleeps for half the day would possess the power to hurt my feelings. But that happens a little whenever I\u2019m trying really, really, really hard to make her laugh and she looks at me like she\u2019s a clerk at the DMV explaining to someone in line that they completed the wrong form and need to go back to the back of the line. Sometimes I want to scream, \u201cEVERYONE ON THE INTERNET THINKS I\u2019M FUNNY; PLEASE LAUGH AT ME, YOU TINY TYRANT!\u201d But then she\u2019ll look at me and say, \u201cSnack, please.\u201d Which means I need to hold my tears and go find her some blueberries.\n\nMostly, though, I never imagined being as invested in someone\u2019s growth and survival and happiness as I am with hers. My primary jobs as a parent, I\u2019ve learned, are to 1) keep her alive and safe and healthy, 2) do whatever I can to help her grow and mature and reach her potential and 3) get the fuck out of the way when getting the fuck out of the way is necessary so that I don\u2019t stunt that growth and limit that potential.\n\nAnd I, like all other parents, am learning on the job. I make mistakes and hope these mistakes prove to be inconsequential. I try to remove all of the weird and awkward and unflattering parts of me and give her nothing but the good stuff. Which I know is a fool\u2019s errand because if that stuff is a part of me, it\u2019s a part of her, too, but that doesn\u2019t stop me from trying. And I want to fill her with hope and a metaphysical limitlessness. I want her to exist as if walls and ceilings and gravity haven\u2019t been invented yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I need to separate this from the feeling that I am also possessed with that she needs to be protected from her country\u2014her home.\n\nLike the rest of the country this morning, I woke up to the terrible news of the terrorist attack in Las Vegas. When I first hear about these types of mass shootings, they remind me of lightning bolts. So sudden and random in their devastation. And largely unpreventable. What could you possibly do to prevent yourself from being somewhere where someone just decides to start shooting?\n\nThat initial feeling dissipates, though, when remembering that, like avoiding water and trees and open spaces and polelike objects when thunderstorms strike, there are substantive ways to help limit the chances of something like Las Vegas happening. But America isn\u2019t interested enough in doing those things. It continues to choose, instead, to allow itself to clutch and horde increasingly efficient human-killing devices to guard itself against some existential and nonexistent racial threat. America is so guilt filled about what it\u2019s done to nonwhite people\u2014and so fearful of retribution\u2014that it\u2019s willing to kill itself in order to keep itself armed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this is the country my 23-month-old daughter lives in. It is also a country where her president and her government are openly antagonistic toward people who happen to be black and happen to female\u2014two things she happens to be. It\u2019s a country where the mere acknowledgment that\u2014because she happens to be black and happens to be female\u2014she might have different adversities to face from someone who is only one of (or neither of) those things is met with violent resistance.\n\nMy wife and I have, to the best of our abilities, childproofed our house to protect her from the kamikaze streak young children have. We feed her nothing but organic foods; a month ago, a family member attempted to give her a piece of a Kit Kat, and she bit into it and made a face like she\u2019d just swallowed bird poop. We\u2019re going to teach her Spanish and French, arming her with a trilingual and door-opening weapon. We plan to encourage her to play sports so that she\u2019s equipped with whatever positive attributes being on a team and participating in a competitive physical activity will give her.\n\nAlthough, once she comes of age, she\u2019ll be free to choose and practice whichever religious beliefs she feels comfortable with, we\u2019re raising her as a Christian. We take her to church with us and we pray for and with her, equipping her with a spiritual shield. We even started protecting her before she was born, choosing to wait until we were financially capable of providing a comfortable life for her before having her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut she was born in a place\u2014in a country\u2014where tens of millions of her countrymen are devoted, unconsciously and intentionally, to making her less safe and her already precious life more tenuous.

The witness told investigators that Williams wanted to talk to Wade, but Wade had asked him several times to leave, which he finally did, according to the report.\n\nThe witness said that Williams then again returned to the home and was once again asked to leave, with Wade escorting him from a bedroom to the first floor of the home.

Trump began by bigging up his favorite people in the world, the police. After his introductory statement, in which he stated that he and his fellow Americans were \u201cjoined together in sadness, shock and grief,\u201d Trump went right into his deep and abiding love of po-9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and all of the first responders for their courageous efforts and helping to save the lives of so many,\u201d he said. Trump also profusely thanked the FBI, Department of Homeland security and local authorities, saying, \u201cIt shows what true professionalism is all about.\u201d\n\nNow, I think the police in this case definitely deserve kudos for doing such a great job, but it doesn\u2019t escape me that the LVMPD is the very same department that NFL player Michael Bennett is about to sue for excessive force and an obvious lack of professionalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Trump never used the words \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d or even \u201cterrorism,\u201d for that matter. He did drop \u201cevil\u201d a few times in describing Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old white man who is allegedly behind the attack, but one can only imagine what the response would have been if Paddock had been a \u201cGonzales\u201d or \u201cMuhammad.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether these men of color were 10th-generation Americans or not, I would bet my left foot that there would\u2019ve been some direct or indirect reference to protecting this nation and weak borders, anger frothing from his mouth and, you bet your ass, the word \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\n3. Trump is going to Vegas posthaste. \u201cI will be going to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement, first responders and the families of the victims\u201d on Wednesday, he said\u2014a marked departure from his response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, which he is waiting over a week to visit. Trump is slated to go to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday, so I guess he\u2019s not staying long, since he will be in Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Who dis man quoting the Bible? Trump looked about as comfortable as a whoremonger in an eight-pewed Baptist church while saying things like: \u201cWe ask God to help see you through this very dark period. Scripture teaches us that the Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. We seek comfort in those words because we know God lives in the hearts of those who grieve.\u201d\n\nThis from the man who called Second Corinthians \u201ctwo Corinthians\u201d on the campaign trail (he still got the evengelicals anyway). The man whom many view as the devil incarnate even dropped the word \u201clove\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d a few times.\n\n5. Trump noted that he has \u201cdirected that our great flag be flown at half-staff.\u201d So ... he just had to get that \u201cgreat\u201d in there, huh? This, an obvious dig at those who may kneel during the national anthem against the very brutality that Trump implicitly and explicitly condones through his sycophantic love and blind support of law enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe verdict? I would bet my bottom dollar that if this thing had gone more than five minutes, it would have gone left. What I did glean was that being a white man\u2014even a murderous one\u2014has its privileges in Trump\u2019s GREAT America.", "keywords": ["white", "response", "men", "terrorists", "man", "god", "department", "shoot", "las", "takeaways", "great", "bet", "trump", "vegas", "trumps", "love"], "polarity": 0.07859838274932615, "subjectivity": 0.4721990116801439},

Being president comes with compromises that we don\u2019t require in our celebrities and public figures, and I\u2019m not sure the Americans who want her to run for president completely comprehend that. . . .\u201d\n\nWriting in the New York Times from Paris, Thomas Chatterton Williams cautioned, \u201cIf the first year of the Trump administration has made anything clear, it\u2019s that experience, knowledge, education and political wisdom matter tremendously. . . .The presidency is not a reality show, or for that matter, a talk show. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA social media user posted a 2015 piece from Nicole Aschoff in the Guardian questioning even whether the Oprah philosophy is suited for the presidency.\n\nIt was headlined \u201cOprah Winfrey: one of the world\u2019s best neoliberal capitalist thinkers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOprah recognizes the pervasiveness of anxiety and alienation in our society,\u201d Aschoff wrote. \u201cBut instead of examining the economic or political basis of these feelings, she advises us to turn our gaze inward and reconfigure ourselves to become more adaptable to the vagaries and stresses of the neoliberal moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOprah is appealing precisely because her stories hide the role of political, economic, and social structures. In doing so, they make the American Dream seem attainable. If we just fix ourselves, we can achieve our goals. For some people, the American dream is attainable, but to understand the chances for everyone, we need to look dispassionately at the factors that shape success. . . .\u201d\n\nFor Lithwick, writing for Slate, such contemplation might be beside the point. \u201cI have no idea whether Winfrey plans to run for the Oval Office in 2020,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAccording to reports, she is \u2018actively\u2019 considering it. But I heard the force and dignity of her speech as a mirror held up to the country about our own responsibilities, accompanied by a very prominent shoutout to journalists for helping to tell those stories. . . .\u201d\n\nErica Ayisi, NBCBLK: Recy Taylor, Alabama woman raped by six white men, dies at 97 (Dec. 28)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNancy Cordes, CBS News: Oprah for president?

What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

(She isn\u2019t a white supremacist or anything, but she did say that Dunkin\u2019 Donuts are better than Krispy Kremes, which is kind of Hitler-ish, in my opinion.)\n\nIf there is one thing on which we can all agree, I have always assumed, it\u2019s that as a society, we all think murdering children is\u2014at the very least\u2014not a good look.\n\nApparently, I was wrong.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a baby-murdering white guy walked into a church and opened fire, killing people as young as 17 months old. In 2012, Adam Lanza created his own little micro-genocide when he murdered 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn response, the Republican Party, which fancies itself the unwavering, law-and-order protectors of America, addressed these recurring existential threats to the lives and safety of millions of Americans by doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegardless of which side of the aisle on which one sits, it is impossible for any logically thinking human being not to acknowledge that gun violence has become our national scourge. Yet the deification of guns, based on the unassailable doctrine of the Second Amendment, has evolved from a political right into our state-sanctioned religion.\n\nThese horrific tragedies couldn\u2019t convince the congregation of the National-Rifle-Association-Church-of-Christ to move an inch closer to commonsense gun control. The die-hard believers will resist any step toward gun regulations, with counterarguments based on flawed logic, devoid of facts. So we decided to examine them one by one with an objective eye.\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people.\n\nWhile this is true, an overwhelming number of people who kill people use guns. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s statistics show that 69 percent of the homicides in 2014 were from gun deaths. The rate is steadily rising. While it is true that people are causing a rise in violent crime for the second year in a row, that they are using guns to commit these crimes is an unavoidable fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABC News Your trusted source for breaking news, analysis, exclusive interviews, headlines, and videos at\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe number of mass shootings, injuries and even unintentional shootings has risen every year since 2014, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive. There is only one common thread in all of these statistics: guns.\n\nUntil we hear about an outbreak of mass spooning incidents or the growing number of drive-by knifings, let\u2019s acknowledge that people kill people ... with guns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost always with guns.\n\nThe Second Amendment guarantees us the right to our guns.\n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the Second Amendment and apply its literal, fundamentalist meaning to where it states this: \u201cA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single mainstream politician holding office in the House or Senate who has put forth a proposal to repeal the Second Amendment. So we can eliminate that argument there. Full stop.\n\nHaving said that, every other argument is based on how we regulate Americans\u2019 right to bear arms as we do every other freedom.\n\nWe all enjoy the right to free speech, but there are libel, perjury and slander laws that limit what we can say when it might injure others. We are guaranteed the freedom of assembly, but we must apply for parade or protest permits or risk being arrested for obstructing traffic and impeding the rights of others. Our rights to vote, privacy and even sex are all regulated by certain caveats. You must be 18 to cast a ballot. Police can search your underwear drawer with a warrant, and you can\u2019t just grab a woman\u2019s private parts without her consent. (Unless you\u2019re running for president or an Alabama Senate seat.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d\n\nThis might be the stupidest argument ever. The National Rifle Association would have you believe that once we allow the government to register weapons, limit the size of gun magazines or enact background checks, jackbooted thugs will kick down our doors and confiscate our firearms.\n\nThat\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nYou know why jackbooted thugs will never kick in your door and take your guns (aside from the fact that no one has ever told me where I can get a pair of those door-kicking jackboots)? Because lawmakers have already limited the kinds of weapons a person can own. You can\u2019t buy an anti-aircraft gun or a Pershing tank. The government will always have bigger weapons than yours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, I\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama to come take my guns. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet him.\n\nIf guns are against the law, then only criminals will have guns.\n\nIt is true that 34 percent of mass shooters were prohibited from owning weapons. But that also means 66 percent of mass shooters used legal firearms. What if laws simply reduced the numbers by one or two mass shootings per year?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: States with magazine-capacity restrictions experience fewer mass shootings, according to CNN.\n\nFact: States that require background checks on all firearm sales have lower gun-related deaths per capita than states that don\u2019t, according to data from the CDC, the NRA and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFact: A correct, thorough background check would have prevented Dylann Roof from legally purchasing the guns he used in the Charleston, S.C., church shooting. A national ban on assault weapons would have prevented Devin Patrick Kelley from purchasing the Ruger AR-556 that he purchased legally from Academy Sports & Outdoors in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn fact, when we analyzed the Washington Post\u2019s list of U.S. mass shootings since 1966, semi-automatic, assault-style weapons were used in incidents that resulted in 253 deaths.\n\nHow about the small number of crimes that would be prevented if people were turned away because of mental-health issues? What about the number of potential killers who would change their minds during a three-day waiting period? What about the number of lives that would be saved by smaller-capacity magazines?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the logic of \u201cCriminals don\u2019t care about gun laws,\u201d why make any law? Why should there be laws against rape or murder, since murderers gonna murder and rapists gon\u2019 rape?\n\nHey, I thought all lives mattered.\n\nHow is that strict gun regulation working out in Chicago?\n\nChicago is white people\u2019s No. 1 argument against everything, including gun control. According to them, even with its strict gun laws, Chicago is a big, bad bogey monster filled with murderous thugs who will gun you down at any time. It is the most dangerous city in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept that it\u2019s not.\n\nUsing the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting data, Chicago ranks 25th in murders per capita, far behind cities like Jackson, Miss.; Savannah, Ga.; and Kansas City, Kan. In fact, when you look at PoliticIt\u2019s ranking of states with the toughest gun laws, of the 24 cities with higher murder rates than Chicago\u2019s, 15 of them are in states with gun laws laxer than Illinois\u2019. Chicago\u2019s population dwarfs most of the other cities, which is why we hear more often about the large numbers of deaths in the Windy City.\n\nBut according to the numbers, Chicago ain\u2019t got shit on Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nGun advocates live under the delusion that they are all John Wayne waiting for a bad guy to ride into town. The truth is, a good guy with a gun never stops a bad guy with a gun. Even though the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting allows them to cling to that myth, facts say otherwise.\n\nA 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal suicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true that an FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) shows that 3 percent of those incidents were stopped by a civilian with a gun ...\n\n... but the same report shows that 13 percent of those events were halted by unarmed citizens.\n\nYou know what else stops bad guys with guns? Fewer guns for bad guys. Making it more difficult for bad guys to acquire guns.

According to The New York Times, this amounts to some 7% of the town\u2019s population. While details are still unspooling, the county sheriff told The Washington Post that a large number of the victims\u2014somewhere between 12 to 14 of the people who were killed and injured\u2014were children. According to state officials, a child as young as 18 months was among the dead.\n\n\n\nThe massacre in Texas is the deadliest mass shooting of children since Sandy Hook. People will mourn the loss of these young lives as a wake-up call for gun control. But while the shooting in Texas was undeniably gruesome, it was not a unique incident for children in this country. The fact is that in America, more children are shot on a daily basis than the number that were shot in Texas on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study on children and firearm injuries, published in the journal Pediatrics in June by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas, approximately 19 children a day die or receive emergency treatment for a gunshot wound in the United States. The study, which is one of the most comprehensive of its kind, found that in total, between 2012 and 2014, an average of nearly 1,300 children died and 5,790 were treated for gunshot wounds every year.\n\nAnother analysis by The Washington Post using more recent data from 2015 found that on average, 23 children were shot each day that year. This is a uniquely American problem\u2014one study published in the American Journal of Medicine found that in 2010, among high-income countries, 91 percent of children aged 0 to 14 killed by firearms came from the United States.\n\nChildren are shot on a daily basis, but the epidemic largely gets swept under the rug outside of the shock of mass shootings like those in Texas and Sandy Hook. This might have to do with the racial disparity of which children are affected by gun violence\u2014according to the Pediatrics study, black children have the highest rate of firearm mortality overall, at 4.1 per 100,000 versus 1.5 per 100,000 for white children. While white and American Indian children have higher rates of death by firearm suicide, the disparity mostly results from black children having higher rates of death by firearm homicides. A huge proportion of these children who die from firearms overall\u201482 percent\u2014are male, and most are older, between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened in Texas is horrifying. But as we go through the ritualistic steps of processing the massacres that have become woven into the fabric of American life, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we simply can\u2019t talk about gun violence without addressing the fact that children, disproportionately black boys, are dying every day. And those who survive gun violence face ongoing trauma.\n\n\u201cWhen the physical wound is repaired, there\u2019s still another wound\u2014one that can be lifelong,\u201d Arthur Lurigio, a clinical psychologist, told ABC News earlier this year. \u201cOnce a child has been shot, their illusion of safety is completely and utterly shattered.\u201d\n\nAccording to another CDC report, increased risk for youth violence and crime is associated with many factors, including concentrated poverty, unemployment, crowded housing, and neighborhood violence and crime. When looking at the problem of gun violence and children as a whole, it\u2019s clear that tighter gun laws are an important, but only partial, solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout putting this reality at the front and center, the gun control debate has too much potential to err on the side of increasing the policing of minorities rather than fixing the root problems that engender gun violence. For example, as Patrick Blanchfield pointed out in an essay for n+1 last year, the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was part of the larger crime bill signed into law by Bill Clinton that produced many of the frameworks for mass incarceration, like harsh sentencing guidelines and billions in funding for new prison construction. Blanchfield writes:\n\nGiven that today\u2019s Aversive Minimalists include many white liberals whose primary concerns vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cgun violence\u201d more or less boil down to making high-profile rampage killings disappear from their newsfeeds, the possibility that they will embrace measures that gesture at solving that problem while doubling down on militarized policing, surveillance, and America\u2019s overcrowded prisons is depressingly easy to imagine. As many critics have observed, we would be na\u00efve to think that heavy-handed gun control measures would not involve the same disproportionate racial targeting and police violence we rightly condemn in the War on Drugs and in everyday encounters in places from Baltimore to Ferguson to Cleveland to Oakland.\n\nThe gun control debate often swirls around the trends illuminated by the massacre of the month. By failing to focus on the overall issue\u2014one that is inextricably linked with poverty, segregation, and racism\u2014children will continue to suffer. That somewhere around a dozen children were shot in Texas on Sunday is a tragedy, but it\u2019s also one that families face across the country every single day.\n\n", "keywords": ["kids", "control", "study", "gun", "shot", "violence", "american", "america", "firearm", "texas", "day", "children", "killed", "number"], "polarity": 0.05063679288362833, "subjectivity": 0.4107891756625934},

The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived,\u201d Trump tweeted from his personal Twitter on Tuesday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: The tragedy at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, which left 26 dead, occurred Nov. 5, when Trump\u2019s account tweeted out a similar response in the aftermath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo either Trump was doubling down on his condolences (I guess?), or he meant to tweet about the mass shooting Tuesday in Northern California that left at least five dead.\n\nThat gunman went on a violent rampage that began at home and spanned seven locations, including a local elementary school in Tehama County.\n\nAs of Wednesday around 7:50 a.m. EST, Tuesday\u2019s tweet remained online, but people were already drawing their own conclusions. Needless to say, the backlash was swift and biting, with many expressing outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this is not a sign of how much work needs to be done in this country, especially regarding mass shootings, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["went", "work", "wrong", "country", "mass", "springs", "president", "trump", "left", "yalls", "condolences", "dotard", "shooting", "sutherland", "tweeted"], "polarity": -0.07560386473429954, "subjectivity": 0.49951690821256045},

Some of the deaths were deemed \u201cjustifiable,\u201d but many crossed the boundaries of what anyone would consider \u201creasonable.\u201d There was a case where police shot a drunken man through his rear window and another where they shot a woodcarver because they spotted him with a knife ... and a block of wood.\n\n\n\nIn fact, in the 213 Washington police shooting deaths between 2005 and 2014 that were examined by the Seattle Times, only one single cop was convicted.\n\nShielded by the law While most killings by police are deemed justified, controversial cases are nearly impossible to\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThat unbelievable statistic is partly due to a 1986 law that effectively made it nearly impossible to convict a cop of killing someone in Washington state. To find a law enforcement officer guilty of use of deadly force, prosecutors in the state were required to disprove four things:\n\nThe officer reasonably believed the suspect was attempting to commit a felony;\n\nThe officer believed that his life was in danger, or that others\u2019 lives were in danger; Force was \u201cnecessary;\u201d and most importantly ...\n\nThe officer acted \u201cwithout malice\u201d and in \u201cgood faith.\u201d\n\nIt was the fourth provision that was troubling. In Washington state, \u201cmalice\u201d is defined as an \u201cevil intent\u201d or an \u201cabandoned and malignant heart.\u201d If a prosecutor couldn\u2019t prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that a cop who killed someone in cold blood was evil or heartless, the officer couldn\u2019t be convicted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lawmakers and activists had been trying to get the law changed for years, on Thursday, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee finally signed into law a bill that removed the \u201cmalice\u201d requirement from the law enforcement prosecution standard, showing how legislators can come together for the sake of the communities they represent.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHA! I\u2019m just bullshitting. They had no choice but to pass it.\n\nHad the legislation not passed, the measure would have gone up for a vote as a referendum this fall. The state\u2019s politicians have been debating the change for more than two years, with police unions and law enforcement groups lobbying against it, even though polls showed that Washington citizens favored the measure by 75 percent. The Legislature\u2019s version signed Thursday gives police input on new deadly-force rules, whereas the public referendum wouldn\u2019t have necessarily done so, according to The Stranger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s right. It was money from lobbyists that held the law up for so long, and the only thing that changed was when the will of the people put the lawmakers between a rock and a hard place. (If you\u2019ve never leaned against a stack of dollar bills from police unions and corrections officers, let me tell you\u2014it\u2019s as hard as a rock.)\n\nThe elected officials were not moved by Washington\u2019s surge in police killings, like the death of Charlena Lyles, the 30-year-old pregnant mother of four shot at least seven times in her home by Seattle police officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, it was the money that did it, which explains their reluctance to change the law. Because when it comes to causing the deaths of citizens through their reckless actions, there is only one way to describe the 30-plus years that lawmakers allowed killer police officers to walk away scot-free:\n\nEvil.", "keywords": ["cop", "state", "evil", "lawmakers", "shot", "malice", "deaths", "enforcement", "convicted", "officer", "30yearold", "wait", "washington", "cops", "law", "killer", "changes"], "polarity": 0.004472465518977165, "subjectivity": 0.6460359408033827},

With your mother\u2019s permission, they enter your home to look for you, but you aren\u2019t there. Since your mother has let them search, they find items that they claim are related to the burglary incidents.\n\nWhile the police are inside your home searching, another set of officers spies you in the backyard hiding in the bushes. You run away from them, run through your front yard, somehow eluding the officers that are out there as well and manage to climb in a window to get back inside your home, where you come upon other officers still in there conducting a search.\n\nYou run past those officers and into a bathroom, where, for unknown reasons, you grab a gun and begin loading it.

It took at least four hours for the boy to receive medical care, because when the shot went off, police thought it was intended for officers and ducked for cover. They evacuated the family from the home, called in SWAT and set up a barricade response, trying to negotiate with the boy from outside. It wasn\u2019t until a SWAT team made entry late Wednesday that officers realized the boy had been wounded. The boy was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center as distraught relatives screamed in shock. He died at the hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony and two other boys were suspected of burglary in their housing community in East Las Vegas. The police were called by a neighbor at about 2:30 p.m. that Wednesday. The neighbor was fed up with a \u201cplague\u201d of recent burglaries. While waiting for the police to arrive, the neighbor managed to catch and detain one of the boys until police arrived.\n\nThe version of the story told by Metro PD to the Review-Journal says that when they found out where Anthony lived, they went to his house and got permission to enter. Then, according to the paper:\n\nA few minutes later, officers noticed the boy hiding in the backyard, near an oleander bush, and chased him, [police spokesman Jay] Rivera said. They quickly lost the boy, who had actually ran around to the front yard, then re-entered the same home through a window and, for unknown reasons, began loading a gun in a bathroom, Rivera said. The boy didn\u2019t realize at least two officers were still inside the home. \u201cThey confront him right away, order him to put the weapon down,\u201d Rivera said. But instead, the boy ran into a connected bedroom, where officers heard one round discharge. The round did not injure police, and officers did not return fire. That\u2019s when the barricade response began.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe version told to the Review-Journal\u2019s Rachel Crosby on July 13 has not changed much in the days since. On Monday the coroner ruled Anthony\u2019s death a suicide.

Brown, 40, was, in fact, choked to death during the May 14 encounter after a chase through the back hallways of the Venetian casino, CBS notes.\n\nNBC reports that Brown, who also used the name Tashii Farmer, had an enlarged heart and was under the influence of methamphetamine, but Coroner John Fudenberg ruled that Brown died of lack of oxygen, or \u201casphyxia due to police restraint.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLopera also used a Taser on Brown seven times and punched him in the head and neck at the time of the incident, authorities said.\n\nBack in May, Lopera and Brown encountered each other before Brown suddenly started running away.

In the video, an officer\u2014later identified as Bongiovanni\u2014can be seen pulling Hollins from his vehicle before dragging him to the ground in the middle of the street. The cop can be seen gesturing to the driver, who rolls onto his stomach before his hands are cuffed behind his back.\n\nShortly after, however, another cop (McDonald) is seen running on the scene and stomping Hollins in his head.\n\nHollins was booked at the Gwinnett County Jail after the incident on charges of possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, obstruction of a police officer and several other traffic citations, including driving on a suspended or revoked license, operating a vehicle with suspended or revoked registration, and failure to signal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis mug shot showed his bloodied nose and lips.\n\nThe following day, though, both officers were swiftly terminated. Bongiovanni came under further scrutiny after another video surfaced showing him punching Hollins in the face as Hollins had his hands in the air.\n\nHollins spoke out about his encounter with the officers a week later, admitting that he feared for his life when he saw the officers approach him. Hollins, as it turned out, also recognized Bongiovanni from a previous traffic stop back in August 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gwinnett County solicitor general ultimately tossed out the case against Hollins, along with 88 other cases in which Bongiovanni and McDonald were either principal officers or key witnesses.\n\n", "keywords": ["bongiovanni", "traffic", "charges", "multiple", "stop", "man", "indicted", "seen", "brutal", "black", "incident", "officers", "mcdonald", "cops", "video", "hollins", "georgia", "gwinnett"], "polarity": -0.026587301587301587, "subjectivity": 0.42936507936507934},

After the officers had restrained Anderson in handcuffs, Officer Zachary Rosen, to make sure the arrested man was not armed, decided to run through the four cops who were already handling Anderson and step on the detainee\u2019s head so hard that it visibly bounced off of the street like a basketball.\n\nWhen video of Rosen\u2019s alleged assault began to spread, Columbus Public Safety Director Ned Pettus fired Rosen after Deputy Chief Thomas Quinlan found Rosen\u2019s actions to be unreasonable. (Do I have to say \u201calleged\u201d? Unless there was a roach on Anderson\u2019s ear, we can see that his head being stomped on was an act of police brutality.)\n\nPettus\u2019 decision overruled four lower-ranking supervisors in the Columbus Police Department who found Rosen\u2019s use of force to be within policy. Police Chief Kim Jacobs recommended that the officer receive only a few days\u2019 suspension and training on how to search for weapons on suspects. Rosen was apparently unaware that marching on someone\u2019s cranium is a less-than-effective frisking technique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a 27-page ruling on Monday, arbitrator Mitchell Goldberg declared that Rosen could return to work as a Columbus police officer. Goldberg decided that Rosen used more force than necessary, but there was no evidence showing that Rosen intended to injure Anderson, WOSU-FM reports, which could only mean one of two things:\n\nArbitrator Mitchell Golberg is an idiot; or Just before hearing this case, someone stomped on arbitrator Michael Goldberg\u2019s head and Goldberg thinks he\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Goldberg in his decision:\n\nI find that the grievant\u2019s past good work record, and his performance at the highest rewarded level, combined with his intelligence level, is persuasive evidence that he has the ability to adjust his actions to conform with policies and directives in the future as they relate to his use of force in bringing dangerous suspects under control.\n\nYou may be confused about how a video of Rosen committing a crime is excluded from his \u201cpast good work\u201d and the fact that he was fired doesn\u2019t undermine the gobbledygook about his intelligence level, and how he will most assuredly conform to policies in the future. Perhaps you don\u2019t understand how\u2014unless Rosen tripped and fell on Anderson\u2019s head\u2014he didn\u2019t \u201cintend to injure\u201d him. But you\u2019re not a legal scholar, and you\u2019re forgetting the important legal precedent set in the historic Supreme Court case Police v. Every Black Person Ever, when the court issued a majority opinion that read in part:\n\n\u201cWhite people can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nYes, Goldberg excused the headstomper (which is different from a \u201chotstepper\u201d) by explaining how Rosen was a very good police officer when he wasn\u2019t doing the Electric Slide across black men\u2019s skulls, and how he was pretty sure Rosen wouldn\u2019t do it anymore because he only did it once, and that shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosen will undergo intense training for not stomping on people\u2019s noggins before returning to work to terrorize the citizens of Columbus. He will also receive a reduced punishment equivalent to three days of suspension without pay.

However, this week, according to The Advocate, the child\u2019s mother was also arrested on the exact same charge after police accused her of contributing to the death by failing to properly secure the baby, Seyaira Stephens, in her car seat.\n\nMom Brittany Stephens, 20, was arrested Tuesday after police apparently discovered that her daughter\u2019s car seat had not been secured and the straps not adjusted to fit Seyaira\u2019s height. Police said that the \u201clack of securing the seat to the vehicle and the loose straps are a contributing factor in the death\u201d of the baby and show \u201cgross negligence.\u201d\n\nStephens was not driving the vehicle when the crash occurred, but told officers that she had secured the car seat with the baby inside.

L\u2019Jean McKneely said that because of this, Stephens was arrested as \u201cthe person responsible for the buckling of the car seat.\u201d\n\nShe was subsequently booked on one count of negligent homicide and seat belt violation.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life.

And it\u2019ll continue long after the ongoing crisis ends.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of the new Netflix docuseries Flint Town coming out Friday. The eight-episode show has little to do with the water crisis that left the predominantly black city of nearly 100,000 exposed to lead poisoning\u2014yet, at the same time, it has everything to do with it. And it\u2019s necessary viewing for anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist or ally to the environmental justice movement, in particular.\n\nThe cinematic show follows the actual Flint Police Department, an underfunded public service agency (like most others in the city), from 2015 to 2017. The riveting high-speed ride-alongs\u2014which include calls to murder scenes or drug busts\u2014give the viewer an exclusive look into the world of policing and, more importantly, the humans who make it up.\n\nA handful of the 98 officers who make up the police department\u2014the smallest number of officers to police any city of a comparable size in the United States\u2014afford directors Zackary Canepari, Drea Cooper, and Jessica Dimmock an intimate view of their lives. This story steps away from the one-dimensional view of law enforcement we\u2019ve all become accustomed to seeing in TV dramas and media coverage, offering something real and raw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s any of this got to do with the environment?\n\nThe docuseries shows\u2014quite incredibly\u2014how an environmental crisis like Flint\u2019s exacerbates already perilous situations in communities home to people of color and low-income families. Things were bad in Flint long before its water wasn\u2019t drinkable: Poverty has overwhelmed the community since 2000 when General Motors closed its car factory. And as Flint Town makes painfully clear, crime is everywhere.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this series shows us that environmental crises are never the only issue with which vulnerable communities have to deal. Years and sometimes decades of social ills compound to create the structure that allows these kinds of catastrophes to happen in the first place. The docuseries provides the important context to understand the ripple effects contaminated water had on the city and its residents. Residents no longer trusted anyone, including the police department. After all, city officials knew lead was in the water and failed to do anything for months and months.\n\nOfficers are forced to police under a veil of distrust while grappling with the ways the water crisis has impacted them, too. \u201cThere are a lot of officers living in Flint,\u201d said director Jessica Dimmock to Earther. \u201cAt the end of the day, they come into the station. They can\u2019t drink the water there. They\u2019re surrounded by water bottles. [The water crisis] is never far from their minds.\u201d\n\nWater bottles are always lingering in the background of this Netflix show. \u201cThat was intentional and also unavoidable,\u201d said Dummock. \u201cOnce your eyes become aware of it, you see [bottles] everywhere.\u201d It can be as subtle as a plastic water bottle near the kitchen sink or as clear as the packages and packages of water bottles sitting in the Flint Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlint Town not only offers stunning visuals, but it offers a real glimpse of what it\u2019s like to live and serve this community, challenging the stereotypical narrative around environmental justice. The movement was born out of a North Carolina black community fighting for the right to clean roadways. Today, it can mean a lot more.\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nSome scholars have been challenging what we define as our \u201cenvironment.\u201d Is it just the air we breathe? Or can it also include the stressful environment in which a person lives when police don\u2019t arrive at an emergency, or when a mother is worried about making the water pick-up deadline after working a 12-hour shift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll those environmental factors contribute and play off of one another,\u201d said director Drea Cooper to Earther. \u201cYou definitely see some of that through the series.\u201d\n\nSo though this show isn\u2019t about the Flint water crisis, I urge you to watch it. It\u2019s no Planet Earth or scientific expos\u00e9 of how lead leaches into waterways.

Upon their arrival, officers found the body of 31-year-old Dominic Jerome \u201cD.J.\u201d Broadus II on the ground behind the home. According to reports by the law enforcement agencies and the medical examiner, Broadus had been shot three times, at close range, in his head.\n\nTwo weeks later, it still seems that no one has any answers.\n\nWe know that Baker County Sheriff Scotty Rhoden has turned over the case to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, citing the need for transparency in the investigation. The FDLE was called in because relatives and community activists saw a potential conflict of interest in the Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s investigation, for a very interesting reason.\n\nAt the scene, deputies found Gardner Kent Fraser. According to the police report, the 29-year-old Fraser was escorted to the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cat the request of on-scene detectives for further investigation.\u201d Fraser was not arrested and was eventually released.\n\nFraser is the son of former Jacksonville, Fla., Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Ryan T. Fraser. Ryan Fraser was fired from the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Department in 2009 for shooting an unarmed black man, Jerrick Hall. At the time, Jacksonville\u2019s sheriff said that Ryan Fraser was terminated because Hall did not pose a threat to Fraser when the deputy shot the 20-year-old Hall in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf any of this seems suspicious, it doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of this confounding case. Aside from the fact that, according to law enforcement reports, Broadus was found dead at the home of a well-connected family, there\u2019s the fact that Broadus\u2019 cellphone was never found. And there\u2019s one more interesting tidbit:\n\nThere was at least one more person at the scene.\n\nNo one in the public knows who this mysterious \u201cother person\u201d is. The Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s initial report redacts the identity of the individual. Authorities also have redacted on the police report the parts of the supplemental narratives from three other assisting officers at the scene, essentially hiding from the public the person\u2019s name and information about what they found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember that part about \u201cone more interesting tidbit\u201d from earlier? That was a red herring. Because there is one other thing you should know about this case:\n\nGardner Fraser is not just the son of \u201cfired Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Deputy\u201d Ryan T. Fraser. After Ryan Fraser lost his job in Jacksonville, he was somehow able to get another job in law enforcement. Luckily, it was in his hometown of Macclenny ...\n\nAt the Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nTo be fair, Ryan T. Fraser no longer works in Macclenny because he retired four months ago in October 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what we know, according to law enforcement reports: Dominic Broadus was killed in an execution-style manner. Deputies responding to the call found at the scene of the crime the son of their former co-worker, along with another unnamed person whose identity they will not reveal. To date, no one has been arrested. In the intervening weeks, the family of the victim have been left in the dark, and the only answer they have received is, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it. Just chill.\u201d\n\nSeems legit.\n\nBroadus\u2019 father, Dominic Broadus Sr., said, \u201cThe evilness of this crime has caused heartbreak and horror to me and the rest of D.J.\u2019s family, including his mother, his siblings and his son.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe father added:\n\nAt this point we know little about the investigation of D.J.\u2019s murder. Our hopes are that a competent and honest investigation will be conducted. We do know that the main suspect in the case, Gardner K. Fraser, is the son of a retired Baker County deputy sheriff. Understandably, the fact that our son was an outsider in Baker County and the suspect is a longtime, well-connected, Baker County resident, gives us concerns about the fairness of the process. As parents and citizens, we want and we demand a thorough, honest and unbiased investigation.\n\nActivists and community organizations in Florida, including the Dream Defenders, Black Lives Matter and Color of Change, are demanding transparency in the investigation. They say they believe that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Baker County Sheriff\u2019s Department are covering up an execution to protect Gardner Fraser and the Fraser family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to The Root, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said that it does not comment on active investigations, explaining, \u201cOur top priority is to ensure the integrity of the investigation.\u201d The FDLE also said: \u201cOur role is to determine the facts of what happened, and we provide that information to prosecutors so they can make charging decisions. Once the investigation is no longer active, all information can be provided to the public.\u201d\n\nThe Broadus family have united with local and national groups from around the country to demand justice and transparency. They will hold a town hall meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 20, at 6 p.m. at the Emmanuel Church of God in Christ in Macclenny to engage the community and law enforcement in their search for answers.\n\nThey have also set up an online presence on Facebook and Twitter under \u201cJustice4DJBroadus\u201d and ask that anyone with information contact Detective Hollycross at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement at 904-360- 7100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Broadus family said, \u201cSolving this crime and punishing the evildoers will not bring DJ back to us, and although our hearts will be forever broken by this tragic event, justice for my son and our family is demanded.\u201d", "keywords": ["mysterious", "fraser", "son", "dj", "sheriffs", "investigation", "enforcement", "baker", "killing", "ryan", "broadus", "law", "county"], "polarity": 0.062419871794871774, "subjectivity": 0.4016025641025641},

The 19-year-old was driving with her 15-year-old friend when the car\u2019s tire went flat and the duo pulled off the side of the road. After a stranger drove Miller\u2019s friend to get assistance from her family after they found that the spare was also flat, Miller waited in the car and eventually passed out with the car running, doors locked, music blasting and a gun in her lap.\n\n\n\nWhen her relatives arrived, they found that they couldn\u2019t wake her up and decided to call 911. Four Riverside police officers arrived on the scene with their guns drawn after being made aware that Miller had a gun. Attempts to wake up the teenager were unsuccessful, so the officers decided to force their way into the vehicle in fear that Miller might be in need of medical attention. One of the officers smashed the driver\u2019s-side window, which startled Miller. What exactly took place at that moment remains up for debate. However, police fired 23 shots, with Miller being struck 12 times, including four in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we discuss the growing list of African Americans who have been shot down by police, the story of Tyisha Miller is often overlooked. But thanks to Gus Krieger\u2019s film My Name Is Myeisha\u2014based on Rickerby Hinds\u2019 stage play Dreamscape\u2014it\u2019s a two-decade-old story that we won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that you will not see another movie like My Name Is Myeisha. The film, which premiered at the Slamdance Film Festival, which focuses on low-budget independent films, takes on the narrative of police brutality against African Americans and spins it on its head. Unlike other movies that have tackled the epidemic of police officers gunning down African Americans, My Name Is Myeisha takes a totally different approach that is both unique and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nStarring Rhaechyl Walker in the lead role of Myeisha, the film is an artistic revelation that uses hip-hop, spoken-word poetry and dream sequences to recount the final moments of the character\u2019s time on earth before a hail of bullets took her life. The movie is a fictionalized telling of Tyisha\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was unfamiliar with the story of Tyisha Miller,\u201d Walker, who also played Myeisha in the stage play, tells The Root. \u201cWhen Rickerby sent me the script is when I did my research, and it turned my life upside down in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nWalker delivers a zestful performance that outlines Myeisha\u2019s aspirations through dream sequences that happen to coincide with the number of times that she was shot. Instead of being about another slain African American defined by their death, My Name Is Myeisha sets out to tell the story of a young black woman\u2019s aspirations that were tragically cut short before she had the opportunity to see them come to fruition.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique method of storytelling that translates well with the charismatic Walker and her co-star, John Merchant, dominating the screen time. Merchant is especially integral to the film because he plays multiple characters and is the creative force behind each sequence. It\u2019s a tragic hip-hop musical that makes excellent use of its minimal resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Walker, it also proved to be therapeutic and helped her rediscover who she was.\n\n\u201cIt was my real introduction to hip-hop,\u201d Walker reveals. \u201cOf course I heard it, but I didn\u2019t grow up listening to it. I had this idea in my mind that if you listen to hip-hop, you were a certain type of person. It was really naive, but when I met John, and doing this play, I was able to rediscover what hip-hop really is, and it was a whole new world. I didn\u2019t know there was this place I could belong.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly engaging as we get to look at Myeisha\u2019s past, present and what could have been her future. Although it\u2019s fictional, one has to wonder just how much was taken away from the real Tyisha Miller that fateful night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final sequence is especially traumatic as a re-enactment of the moments leading up to the shooting finds Myeisha on the outside looking in while the bullets tear through her body. While discussing this, Walker is nearly brought to tears, despite having been involved with the play for five years before filming the movie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult for me to watch. Even with the first gunshot, and she falls back on the slab, I lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last 10 minutes have a lot of emotion, anger, hurt and happiness. We get to see Myeisha\u2019s life through her eyes, but it\u2019s painful to know that this is still happening today. I hope the people who see this are angry, and I hope they want to do something about these police shootings.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s performance as Myeisha won her the Slamdance Acting Award, while the film took home the Audience Award in the Beyond Feature category. It\u2019s well-deserved because My Name Is Myeisha is both a beautiful and a heartbreaking piece of art rooted in reality. It may not hit movie theaters because of the budgetary constraints, but it has a ton of heart and is worth going out of your way to find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing film and the way stories are told,\u201d Walker says. \u201cA hip-hop musical?

It\u2019s about money. This country is run off money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA had little to say about the death of her son, who worked as a cafeteria manager for the St. Paul school district and was a licensed gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\n\nPhilando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a routine traffic stop in July 2016 after alerting the cop, \u201cI do have a firearm on me.\u201d He then reached for his wallet to hand Officer Jeronimo Yanez his driver\u2019s license. According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield.

The police were called to the scene after being \u201calerted to an actor with a gun.\u201d But Anita Williams, Mark Daniels\u2019 aunt, claimed that her nephew did not own or carry a gun. She also claimed that while Daniels was in the hospital, his body was guarded by \u201cfour or five\u201d police officers and his family wasn\u2019t allowed to see him.\n\nThe case is currently being investigated, as is the case with all fatal police-involved shootings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this from the Post-Gazette:\n\nThe Pittsburgh police officer who fatally shot a man during an exchange of gunfire in Homewood on Feb. 11 has been involved in two other shootings in the past 10 months. Officer Gino A. Macioce, a five-year veteran and field training officer, shot 39-year-old Mark Daniels, a spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto confirmed Tuesday. It\u2019s at least the third time in recent months Officer Macioce has opened fire while on the job in Zone 5. He was involved in non-fatal shootings in January and April, court records show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2017, Macioce shot 20-year-old Christopher Howard, who robbed two women in the area, was approached and chased by Macioce and allegedly pulled out a sawed-off shotgun. Macioce shot Howard, forcing him to drop his weapon.\n\n\n\nAnd then, in January 2018, Macioce was involved in the shooting of 26-year-old Eric Farrar, who allegedly was carrying a shotgun, dropped it when the officers ordered him to and then reached into his waistband for a pistol to fire at them. Macioce and a second officer on the scene shot and critically wounded him.\n\nNow, is it possible that each of these shootings was justified and that Macioce just happened to be the officer on the scene each time? Yes, that is possible. Is it also possible that Macioce happened to have three criminals separately attempt to shoot him in less than a year\u2019s time? Yes, that is possible. Considering that many officers can go entire 30-year careers without anyone shooting at them, is it possible that Macioce is just unfathomably unlucky? Yes, that is possible.\n\nRegardless of the possibilities, it\u2019s definitely true that violence keeps finding Gino Macioce. Or perhaps violence doesn\u2019t have to look that hard because Macioce keeps looking for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd since it\u2019s true that each man Macioce shot was black, it\u2019s also possible that Gino Macioce just keeps finding reasons to shoot black people.", "keywords": ["cop", "daniels", "shot", "macioce", "black", "officer", "officers", "scene", "kills", "pittsburgh", "shoots", "yes", "possible", "shootings"], "polarity": 0.004166666666666665, "subjectivity": 0.53671875},

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members. If this turns out to be exactly the way they\u2019ve been written, it\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nThe inquest jury had also recommended charges against four other staff members\u2014JorDon Johnson, Thomas Laine, Dominique Smith and John Weber\u2014but the district attorney declined to prosecute them.", "keywords": ["turned", "charges", "death", "facing", "inmate", "charged", "died", "thomas", "evans", "dehydration", "showing", "week", "water", "staffers", "milwaukee", "jail"], "polarity": -0.03819444444444445, "subjectivity": 0.2773148148148148},

In a sobering interview with Baltimore Beat, the grieving mother makes clear that family members tried multiple times to intervene and to de-escalate the situation between Gaines and police. That police were aware that Gaines was having a breakdown. That the profound pain Dormeus feels following her daughter\u2019s death has left \u201cno room\u201d for anything else.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be right for the rest of our lives,\u201d she says.\n\nGaines\u2019 family was awarded more than $37 million in damages last week after a six-woman jury found that the police response to the situation was not reasonable.\n\n\n\nGaines was fatally shot by police in August 2016 following an hours-long standoff at her home; they had come to serve a warrant to Gaines for a traffic violation, and to her fiance for an alleged assault.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Dormeus reveals that Gaines suffered from lead-paint poisoning and that she battled depression throughout her life. A retired psychiatric nurse, Dormeus also tells the Baltimore Beat that officers were made aware that Gaines was likely having a breakdown.\n\nShe and other family members \u201cbegged all day\u201d for officers to let them speak to Gaines to de-escalate the situation, but they were told that to do so would be \u201cagainst protocol,\u201d in her words. Dormeus also called Gaines\u2019 doctor and had her on the phone ready to talk to police, but they refused to speak to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What about flash-bang grenades and smoke bombs?\u2019\u201d Dormeus recalls telling police, when asking them about what action they would take against her daughter. \u201cThey said that was out of protocol because there was an innocent child there. But they ended up shooting an innocent child.\u201d\n\nGaines\u2019 son, Kodi, was shot by the police in the arm. Initially, the Baltimore Police Department claimed that Gaines was responsible for the child\u2019s injury.\n\nWhat Dormeus\u2019 interview makes painfully clear is the innumerable ways that Gaines\u2019 death continues to shape the lives of her family members. One heartbreaking passage outlines the effects that the deadly police shooting had on Kodi, who, Dormeus says, has become a completely different child since his mother\u2019s death:\n\nHe\u2019s faced with a lifetime of therapy and all of these outcomes for this type of trauma, drug abuse, suicide, lack of being able to take care of himself from depression. He suffers from anxiety, night terrors, he\u2019s become aggressive, which was never in his character. He\u2019s physically abusive, he\u2019s lying, something that was never tolerated. My oldest daughter told me he has turned dark. He\u2019s not an average six-year-old like he should be. When you know a child pre-trauma and now have to deal with him post-trauma, it\u2019s not just a shock to the child, it\u2019s a shock to his caregivers. You\u2019re faced with these new challenges for something that was out of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work of surviving\u2014of dealing with and attempting to heal Kodi\u2019s pain, as well as her own\u2014is all-consuming:\n\nI\u2019m a mess. Sometimes it gets very dark. I can\u2019t get out of bed. Kodi is experiencing anxiety and panic attacks. I have panic attacks. Not wanting to eat. I have to force myself to eat sometimes. The sporadic crying. I just start screaming and crying. There are not even words to explain the depth of hurt and pain. I\u2019m not even angry with Ruby, there\u2019s no space there, there\u2019s too much pain. And that\u2019s how I\u2019m able to stay focused. There\u2019s no room for anger and pain. I\u2019m so profoundly hurt. Especially when I know all means weren\u2019t exhausted. There was no urgency, it was six hours later. They can wait it out for days. I was a psych for nurse for years. There\u2019s a group of mothers in court everyday to support me and they are my source of comfort and strength. They really do understand.\ufeff\n\nIn the aftermath of her daughter\u2019s death, Dormeus has turned to these unfathomable sisterhoods: groups of mothers who have all lost their children to violence. There is even one specifically for mothers who have been affected by police violence, the Coalition of Concerned Mothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so profound, the connection the mothers have, because we share a common pain that nobody, unless they walk in their shoes, will ever imagine,\u201d Dormeus says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want them to.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Baltimore County says that the county is considering filing an appeal against the verdict.", "keywords": ["hes", "speaks", "theres", "korryn", "family", "gaines", "child", "baltimore", "dormeus", "rest", "mother", "pain", "lives", "right", "mothers", "wont", "situation"], "polarity": 0.020195467797508616, "subjectivity": 0.4425806166622493},

Thomas Allers and Wayne Jenkins\u2014for levels of corruption that range from breaking into citizens\u2019 houses and robbing them of cash, robbing drug dealers with ski masks and selling the drugs, and racketeering conspiracy to covering up police-involved killings, filing for unearned overtime pay, planting evidence, and performing searches without warrants as well as illegal stop and seizures has reverberations for their victims who are seeking justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore City State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office estimates that \u201cthousands\u201d of cases have been tainted by the convictions of the officers. Defense attorneys like Deborah Levi, who leads an initiative by the public defender\u2019s office to track police misconduct, and Ivan Bates estimate the number at around 3,000 after a case search.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s conservative when we say 3,000,\u201d Levi told The Root. \u201cThat only goes back to 2011. It\u2019s safe to say you could go back to 2008 for Rayam, 2006 for Gondo, probably 2010 for Jenkins and Hersl.\u201d\n\n\n\nBates is representing at least 20 clients who were arrested just by Sgt. Jenkins alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour officers in the Gun Trace Task Force case admitted to committing crimes dating back to 2010 or earlier. Ten more officers are being accused based on court testimony in which they were named. Federal prosecutors say that their investigation continues. Prosecutors used the racketeering statute that they usually use against drug crews and gangs for these officers. The corruption was so far-reaching that it included bail bondsmen who were sold drugs given to them by officers and police officers from other jurisdictions, like Philadelphia, who were involved.\n\n\n\nMany of the officers had racked up dozens of citizen complaints before this trial. Many citizens of Baltimore aren\u2019t surprised about any of the evidence that has come up in trial; they have complained about this abuse for years, often to deaf ears.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has been fired and a new commissioner, Darryl DeSousa, appointed by the mayor. The Police Department has since said that it will implement a fingerprint-scanning technology to thwart overtime fraud and will start ordering polygraph tests on members of specialized units. In the midst of the trial, Baltimore went 12 days without a murder in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more complicated about the dismissal of tainted cases is that out of thousands of cases, inevitably there will be not just innocent victims of police abuse, but people who have committed crimes against the community who will walk because of these officers\u2019 abuse of power.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different from an actual innocence case where DNA exonerates everyone and everyone feels good about that,\u201d Levi acknowledged. \u201cThese are people who have alleged to have committed a crime, and that\u2019s less sexy to the community. The question is, how can you let these people go? But our answer to that is the government is in power and these are ill-gotten gains by the government. The focus is on the fact that this was a massive abuse of power. If we let the government abuse its power, then we have shredded democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victim, Andre Crowder, said during the press conference that officers pulled him over for an alleged seat belt violation and searched his car, finding a gun. He claims that $10,000 was taken later during a search of his home. He was in jail for three days before he could post bail. In that time, his 3-year-old died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a victim of this corruption in this city,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cI was taken away from my family for three days and I lost my 3-year-old son. It\u2019s bigger than the mark they put on my record.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn one case, prosecutors say, police handcuffed one man, took his house keys, broke into a safe in his basement and stole $100,000 out of $200,000 found in the safe, and filmed a video showing them discovering the smaller amount.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese criminals that hid behind a badge and preyed on the African-American community, they didn\u2019t care about anything other than if you had money. The whole system relies on the credibility of the officers who make the arrests,\u201d Bates said. \u201cA number of retirements have happened. There\u2019s a new police commissioner. It\u2019s gonna take a while to change the culture. But you have to prosecute the officers that are doing it and hold them accountable.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["gun", "pick", "drugs", "baltimore", "covered", "killings", "sold", "officers", "bates", "abuse", "say", "house", "jenkins", "pieces", "stole", "jovonne", "city"], "polarity": 0.020850306342109614, "subjectivity": 0.40127510922592896},

His new video combines the style of the band at Miami-Dade County High School\u2019s 1992 Senior Prom with music from the band The Time (if Morris Day had a stroke and the band replaced him with someone else who had a worse stroke but also had less musical talent).\n\nReminiscent of the #11 video from BET\u2019s Video Soul weekly countdown (It doesn\u2019t matter which week, they\u2019re all the same) \u201cMink Slide\u201d features King Flex sporting a variety of smoking jackets as he entertains light-skinned women in a nightclub backed by a Casio keyboard set on \u201cfunky white nonsense\u201d and a house band.\n\nBut the genius of the video is the stage performance.

Something about a nerdtastic property holding such cultural significance put me in a state of bliss. So I made a return trip, you know, to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. (Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the only reason.)\n\n\n\nDuring the second viewing, something occurred to me regarding Erik \u201cI Shouldn\u2019t Like You as Much as I Do\u201d Stevens, aka Killmonger. I hesitate to call him a villain. A villain drudges up images of some huge, purple-skinned menace trying to fetch some mystical stones, a threat so powerful that the next Marvel installment, Avengers: Infinity War, must be divided into two parts.\n\nKillmonger is more of an adversary, an antagonist you feel for because his motives are all too real. Black folks can relate to being done with the world\u2019s bullshit, and I can guarantee that some of us left the theater wondering what we\u2019d do if we had access to all of Wakanda\u2019s resources. Klaue? He can go die in a fire for stealing our stuff and calling us \u201csavages,\u201d but you not so secretly hope that Killmonger and T\u2019Challa will come together, especially when you realize that Black Panther isn\u2019t just peak Afrofuturism; it\u2019s also revisionist history.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel is no stranger to telling a story within the context of actual historical events; just think (\u201cO Captain, My Captain\u201d) America, with his patriotic shield and penchant for punching Nazis. It adds a fantastic layer to these otherworldly stories\u2014the knowledge of some grand superpower existing during our darkest hours. That\u2019s what Captain America stood for; even before the super-soldier program, Steve Rogers was full of heart and optimism, a little guy who wanted to help the little guy.\n\nBut it\u2019s much easier for an all-American white soldier to take a chance than for an African king. This time around, I peeped them slave ships in that opening narration, so don\u2019t expect the Black Panther to jump at the chance to help the good ol\u2019 U.S. of \u201cAye, we\u2019re gonna enslave your people and take them to this stolen land\u2014we mean, shared equally with the natives\u2014happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nStill, that\u2019s Killmonger\u2019s entire beef with the Wakandans. They\u2019ve had every opportunity to help black folks, but chose to stay hidden. King T\u2019Chaka was so set on this that he killed his own brother\u2014and Killmonger\u2019s father\u2014N\u2019Jobu. That is classic revenge motivation, but it becomes more complex (and tragic) when you realize what was happening back in 1992, the year Killmonger was orphaned by his own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s close to director Ryan Coogler\u2019s hometown of Richmond, Calif., on the surface, Oakland, Calif., in 1992 doesn\u2019t seem too significant. During my first viewing of the movie, I thought they were simply pulling a Civil War, which recalled the date when Tony Starks\u2019 parents were killed.\n\nBut while the opening of Black Panther is a variation on this theme, when Zuri later tells the story to T\u2019Challa, we see N\u2019Jobu pleading with his brother to help their black American brethren fight violence and over-policing, everything we, the people of 2018, know to have been a harsh reality for generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething about \u201cover-policing\u201d and \u201c1992\u201d stuck with me after my second viewing of Black Panther, so I relied on my good friend Google to uncover what was in the back of my mind.\n\n1992 is when the Los Angeles riots took place. Rodney King, y\u2019all. Yes, in addition to everything else, Black Panther went there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the riots didn\u2019t take place in Oakland, but you best believe the character of N\u2019Jobu would\u2019ve heard about them. Leaving your black utopian society to learn about the police, the supposed protectors of the country you\u2019re surveilling, beating the shit out of a black man? And getting away with it? N\u2019Jobu was in America during one of the most well-publicized atrocities toward the black community.\n\n\n\nImagine living in Wakanda, a world where black folks are treated with love and respect, then being sent out and bearing witness to Rodney-fucking-King. The riots could easily have been the tipping point, the moment N\u2019Jobu decided that his people needed to do something. It was certainly better than the alternative: the riots happening after his death, leaving his son\u2014who would ultimately become Killmonger\u2014alone to deal with it. It certainly makes little Erik\u2019s line about everyone dying around them more heartbreaking, especially since he sheds no tears.\n\nAs a man, however, Erik Stevens/Killmonger does cry, because he realizes what he\u2019s become as he sits in the ancestral plane with his father. And even among all that violence and death, N\u2019Jobu still had dreams of showing his son life as it could be in Wakanda. He wanted to bring his son home\u2014or, perhaps, he wanted to create that home in our country. Witnessing the power of Vibranium in this narrative, that single stolen vial could\u2019ve started a revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo here is your villain/anti-hero: Erik Killmonger, left fatherless in a world full of so-called protectors who abuse his brethren. He\u2019d grow up to see more men, women and children go through the same ordeal as or worse than Rodney King\u2019s, only to become social media hashtags. He\u2019d grow up hearing us tell wistful stories of \u201cthe Motherland,\u201d while simultaneously dealing with white folks telling us to \u201cgo back to Africa,\u201d as if we chose to be here in the first place.\n\nAnd yet Killmonger would also know that his family in that far-off prosperous land would kill one of their own to keep their land and resources safe, only to later sign the Sokovia Accords to police those with superpowers. So he decided that he\u2019d create \u201cthe Motherland\u201d for himself and for us. Villain or not, Killmonger was willing to start from the ground up to let them know who we are. It\u2019s so understandable that even T\u2019Challa snapped at his ancestors to tell them they\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe idea of us being one tribe, as T\u2019Challa says in the midcredits scene, works both ways. The betterment of our people will resonate with us all, but that also means that the brutality against our people connects us. No one knew that better than Killmonger. I imagine that T\u2019Challa respected his cousin\u2019s wishes to bury him in the ocean, but I hope his influence will live with the Black Panther legacy for generations to come.\n\nWakanda forever.", "keywords": ["tchalla", "know", "folks", "cant", "help", "wanted", "black", "history", "panther", "revisionist", "killmonger", "riots", "njobu"], "polarity": 0.09071616789008093, "subjectivity": 0.472099292615597},

Ain\u2019t gonna tear up my cars.\u201d\n\nShoupe was not part of the slow-speed chase that spanned two counties, but he arrived on scene shortly after his officers fired the deadly shots, which was when his comments were recorded.\n\n\u201cI love this shit,\u201d he continues. \u201cGod, I tell you what, I thrive on it. If they don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give the damn order to kill that motherfucker, they\u2019re full of shit. Take him out. I\u2019m here on the damn wrong end of the county.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaughter can be heard as the sheriff makes his comments.\n\nThe incident began last April when Smithville, Tenn., police tried to pull Dial over for driving on a suspended license. At the time, he was driving a 1976 pickup with a fully loaded trailer being pulled at the back. The chase started in DeKalb County before crossing over into White County, where White County deputies took over the chase.\n\nDial\u2019s wife, Robyn, says she is still not sure how the situation escalated so quickly, leading to the death of her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he stop?\u201d Robyn Dial said. \u201cHe was scared. I know him enough to know that.\u201d\n\nThe chase never reached high speeds. DeKalb County deputies told the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that the chase was more like a funeral procession.\n\nWhen asked by an investigator from the bureau how fast the cars were going, DeKalb County Detective Jimmy Martin responded, \u201cWe might have got up to 50 at one point. For the most part, it was 30 to 40 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeKalb deputies backed off at the county line and handed off the chase to White County, whose deputies tried to use their patrol cars to get Dial to stop. Reserve Deputy Adam West, who was driving his personal pickup at the time, also got involved in the chase.\n\nAs noted earlier, Shoupe was not part of the chase but gave the ultimately fatal orders.\n\n\u201cPer 59 [the sheriff], use deadly force if necessary. Take the subject out by any means necessary,\u201d a radio dispatcher can be heard telling the deputies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that order, West took out his gun. According to News Channel 5, minutes later, deputies managed to push Dial\u2019s truck off the road. West got out of his truck and immediately opened fire. Sparta Police Officer Charlie Simms also started shooting.\n\nDial was hit in the head.\n\n\u201cI feel with every part of me that\u2019s exactly what they wanted to do, was kill him,\u201d Robyn Dial told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe district attorney ruled the shooting justified, but Robyn Dial\u2019s lawsuit is focused on the callous remarks the sheriff made after her husband was killed. She is suing not only the sheriff but also White County, West and Simms.\n\nThe lawsuit charges that Shoupe \u201cpreferred to shoot and kill Mr. Dial rather than risk damaging his patrol cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can thrive on taking a human life. That\u2019s not law enforcement,\u201d attorney David Weissman told the news station. \u201cIf that\u2019s the mentality of the highest policymaker in the county, that\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImmediately after the shooting, Deputy West is clearly upset, but Shoupe can be heard comforting him, telling him that he had done right by following orders.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about this. I made the decision. You don\u2019t have to worry about it. I took that away from y\u2019all. You don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Everything\u2019s cool. You done exactly right,\u201d the sheriff says.\n\nRobyn Dial still doesn\u2019t believe that her husband had to die.\n\n\u201cThey could have let him go 10 more miles down the road; he probably would have run out of gas. ... I just hope he knows I loved him,\u201d Dial said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not the first time that Shoupe has been subject to a federal lawsuit. Late last year, both Shoupe and White County Judge Sam Benningfield were hit with suits accusing them of carrying out \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d after Benningfield signed a standing order permitting inmates to get 30 days\u2019 credit toward jail time if they agreed to a birth control procedure\u2014either a vasectomy or a birth control implant.", "keywords": ["white", "shit", "dial", "man", "shoot", "tennessee", "ordering", "told", "officers", "slowspeed", "shoupe", "unarmed", "dont", "west", "recorded", "deputies", "chase", "sheriff", "county"], "polarity": 0.015366193260930094, "subjectivity": 0.43372876636034524},

Would you mind providing one?\n\nNo problem! In this context, Hotep refers to Pan-African extremists who often infuse their Pan-Africanism with misogyny, a Trumpian relationship with facts and understanding of context, and a steadfast belief in bizarre and ridiculous conspiracy theories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance?\n\nThe belief that menstruation is unnatural and only happens to Black women because of a European virus.\n\nThe what that what is what and what???\n\nExactly.\n\nLike, you know how annoying some college students are the summer after freshman year, when they come home and think they all of a sudden know everything about everything just because they managed not to flunk out? Well, hoteps tend to be that way too, except add 30 years and a quart of ash, and substitute The Isis Papers for English 101.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, hotep doesn't necessarily describe people who are just Pan-African?\n\nNo. Just the people who use Afrocentricity as a Trojan horse; giving their regressive fuckshit a veneer of authenticity and respectability. I actually wouldn't even call these people pro-Black, because their pro-Blackness doesn't extend to the LGBTQ community, Black women who happen to be feminists, and Black men who see through and call out their bullshit. Basically, anyone who doesn't subscribe to the belief that the (straight) Black man's dick is an unimpeachable Yahweh.\n\nDoes the hotep community have leaders?\n\nAmerica's most prominent hotep is probably Tariq Nasheed, creator of Hidden Colors, which is essentially the hotep syllabus and seems poised to replace Booty Talk as the longest running Black documentary series. There's also Dr. Boyce Watkins, a man who just really needs a spa day or something. And then there's Dr. Umar Johnson, who apparently got his PhD at the same school that granted Dr. Pepper a degree, and has been raising money for years to fund a school that doesn't exist. I suspect he's using the donations to splurge on Muscle Milk and Snickers Ice Cream Bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've seen Dr. Umar Johnson's name on Facebook recently. Didn't he just realize some type of video?\n\nYes. A 45-minute-long rant against someone called a General Sara Suten Seti. It's basically Hotep Loaded Lux versus Hotep Murda Mook.

At the 1:32 mark, this nigga pronounces \"protracted\" so hard that I felt a blood vessel burst in my neck. By the fact that he says he's in Florida \u2014 and looks to be in a hotel room \u2014 but is rocking a Philadelphia Phillies knit stocking cap. By the gallon of sweat you know accumulated in his cap. That cap probably weighed 18 pounds by the end of his rant. By him saying \"look at my face when you're talking to me\" at the 3:20 mark, like he's Skyping that nigga instead of staring at himself. By his impressively worded stream of prison bunk bed consciousness. By \"SPEAK YOUR SPEECH, NIGGA!\" \u2014 which I'm totally putting on a shirt to add to our line at Tees In The Trap. By \"All your information comes from other niggas books!\" which is such a bizarre insult because that's where everyone gets information from. Unless Dr. Umar Johnson is wishing information into existence; conjuring it from the aether. (Which, all things considered, actually makes sense.) By the fact that, for someone who is so anti-gay, this rant is homoerotic as a motherfucker. At 5:55 he says \"You think I aint study your little nut ass, nigga\" with fury and intensity, which is a pretty damn gay thing to say. Not that there's anything wrong with studying little nigga's nut asses. Study all the little nigga nut asses you desire! But I'm just saying.

With no action necessary from people who were convicted, 3,038 misdemeanor convictions will be dismissed and sealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, NPR reports, prosecutors will review nearly 5,000 additional felony convictions to see if they can be reduced to misdemeanors.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the dismissals will happen automatically, requiring no effort on the part of those with marijuana-related offenses on their records to expunge those convictions themselves. Gasc\u00f3n, in a statement, noted that although petitioning to have these records cleared has been in place in San Francisco, the process is costly and can require legal help. It was noted that only 23 such petitions were filed in the last year.\n\nThe decision will disproportionately affect the city\u2019s black and Latinx residents, who\u2019ve been arrested at far greater rates than their white peers throughout the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NPR, which cites numbers from the district attorney\u2019s office, San Francisco\u2019s black residents made up just 7.8 percent of the city\u2019s population but made up 41 percent of marijuana-related arrests in 2000. A decade later, even though the percentage of black people living in San Francisco dropped (to 6 percent), they made up an even greater share of marijuana-related arrests, at nearly 50 percent.\n\nThat number was even worse than California\u2019s statewide average. According to a 2016 study by New Frontier Data, a firm that provides data analytics on the cannabis industry, nearly a quarter of all people jailed for marijuana-only offenses were black\u2014even though black, Latino and white people consume marijuana at similar rates.\n\nIn a statement that stands in sharp contrast to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice\u2019s new drug policies, Gasc\u00f3n said that San Francisco was \u201ctaking the lead to undo the damage that this country\u2019s disastrous, failed drug war has had on our nation and on communities of color in particular.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further emphasized the racial disparities in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cWe know there were tremendous failures in the war on drugs, and we criminalized large sections of our community,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cThe African-American and Latino communities were the most harmed by this.\u201d\n\nLt.

On Nov. 19, 2011, he somehow set off his medical device. When an emergency operator tried to talk to Chamberlain through a loudspeaker in his bedroom, he didn\u2019t respond, so she called an ambulance. The White Plains, N.Y., Police Department followed the ambulance to Chamberlain\u2019s home, where he answered the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the officers that everything was OK, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The medical-device operator personally called the White Plains Police Department to cancel the emergency call, but that wasn\u2019t enough, either. Chamberlain\u2019s niece, who lived downstairs, asked the cops to let her speak to him, but they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe cops insisted on coming in, so they tried to break down the door for over an hour. During that hour, the cops yelled at Chamberlain. They screamed for him to open the door. Chamberlain yelled through the door: \u201cI\u2019m a sick old man,\u201d to which Officer Stephen Hart replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t give a fuck, nigger!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the officers finally broke the door down, they shot the 68-year-old man with a Taser in the neck and abdomen. Then they shot him with a less-than-lethal beanbag from a shotgun. They hit him with a baton. Then one of the officers claimed that a 68-year-old man, who had already been shot with a Taser and a beanbag gun and couldn\u2019t walk 40 feet without wheezing, attacked them with a knife. So the officer shot Kenneth Chamberlain in the chest.\n\nTwice.\n\nFor five months, the police refused to identify the officer who shot Chamberlain. When the name of the officer, Anthony Carelli, was finally identified, he insisted that Chamberlain was going to kill him with the butcher knife he was holding as he charged at the officer. Even after the information came out that Carelli was facing a $10 million lawsuit for beating two brothers and calling them \u201crag heads,\u201d the Police Department, the police union and Carelli stuck with the story. They stuck by the story even when the autopsy showed that Chamberlain wasn\u2019t even facing the officer. They stuck by the story even when the coroner said that Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have been holding a knife. Carelli stuck by his story even after it was proved that Chamberlain\u2019s hands were at his side when he was shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Anthony Carelli got away with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to trial. A grand jury refused to indict the officers. A federal jury rejected a civil suit against Carelli and the city of White Plains in 2016 after the judge refused to allow evidence of the racial slurs or Carelli\u2019s past. Now Joon Kim, who replaced U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara when he was fired by President Donald Trump after refusing to resign, has announced that no civil rights charges will be filed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement announcing his reasoning for closing the case, Kim said:\n\n\u201cOfficer Carelli believed that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously injured by Mr. Chamberlain.

After the surprise vote, Breed, who had been serving as board president when Mayor Lee died in December, said that she plans to run for a full mayoral term in the regularly scheduled election in June.\n\nTo those who might say, \u201cWell, Breed was only named \u2018acting\u2019 mayor after Ed Lee died, so what\u2019s the big deal about Tuesday night\u2019s vote?\u201d be advised that there is a direct precedent to the unique situation: In 1978, then-San Francisco Supervisor Dianne Feinstein was voted in as acting mayor by her fellow board members mere days after then-Mayor George Moscone was gunned down in his City Hall office by a deranged former supervisor, Dan White. (Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California history, was also killed in the shooting.)\n\nIn \u201978, there was no dramatic coup from fellow board members: Feinstein fulfilled the interim role, then went on to win a full mayoral term months later during the regularly scheduled election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why was Breed\u2019s fate so different Tuesday night?\n\nAt a national political moment when, for the first time, black women have been elected mayors in New Orleans and Charlotte, N.C.\u2014two moderately liberal American cities\u2014San Francisco, for all its stubborn reputation as a wacky, anything-goes progressive stronghold, just exposed the diet racism at its core. Breed could have relinquished her title of board president and remained in an acting-mayor capacity while also campaigning for the seat, much as Feinstein did.\n\nBut, as Alicia Garza of Black Lives Matter put it:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the manner of black women who have been thrown under carriages, buses and Uber cars since the beginning of time in America, Breed, of course, made a gracious statement after Tuesday night\u2019s vote:\n\nThe six board members who sucker punched Breed out of the acting mayor\u2019s spot Tuesday night replaced her with a white male fellow board member, Mark Farrell\u2014who had not ever expressed any interest in the interim role, at least not officially.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a lot of awful in this story, starting with what Tuesday night\u2019s vote signals about Breed\u2019s standing among her fellow supervisors. She is one of the few elected officials who champion the shrinking population of black San Francisco residents. A few of Breed\u2019s African-American constituents turned up Tuesday night and began shouting \u201cThis is WAR!\u201d after the vote to remove Breed from the acting mayor\u2019s role.\n\nI\u2019ll spare you all the behind-the-scenes shady dealings that likely drove Breed\u2019s ouster Tuesday night, but it is important to note a particularly telling detail: Hillary Ronen, one of the white female supervisors who voted to place Farrell in the acting mayor\u2019s role, actually got up and made a tearful speech about how terrible it was that Ron Conway, a wealthy white venture capitalist, was supporting Breed in her bid to be the city\u2019s first black female mayor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is absolutely the case that the tech companies have run roughshod across the city, causing rising housing costs and crazy-bad traffic from all the car-hailing services and tech-company buses that ferry workers back and forth to nearby Silicon Valley; they have also refused to hire local blacks and Latinos.\n\nBut why would Ronen and the other supervisors who voted to oust Breed assume that Breed would somehow become Conway\u2019s or the tech industry\u2019s puppet? In typical bogus \u201cliberal progressive\u201d fashion, Ronen apparently assumed the worst of Breed. And in a lame attempt to \u201cprotect\u201d the interests of the struggling populations in San Francisco from what she apparently imagines to be Breed\u2019s coming greed-fest, she voted to push Breed out of the acting mayor\u2019s seat and replace her with Farrell, who is (wait for it!) a wealthy venture capitalist representing the city\u2019s wealthiest area, the Marina District.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a bonus note of progressive-liberal hypocrisy: Ronen and a few other supervisors who voted to remove Breed Tuesday night had, just two days earlier, been on the agenda at the Women\u2019s March in San Francisco, espousing intersectional unity and resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA homegirl, Breed was born in San Francisco in 1974, four years before Feinstein came to prominence as a result of the tragic events at City Hall in 1978. In the years since, Breed watched as the part of the city she would represent as mayor, Bayview-Hunter\u2019s Point, became the last corner of the city where blacks could afford to live\u2014and now this area, even, is in danger of being gentrified.\n\nTrue, it is not over yet, and as a native of San Francisco, I am rooting for Breed to win a full term. But if you consider what happened Tuesday night and feel a bit pessimistic, you are not alone.\n\nI\u2019ve long given up believing in the city\u2019s long-ago reputation as a hippy-dippy, peace-and-love kinda town. As we saw Tuesday night, in the Board of Supervisors chamber at City Hall, the tech-driven boomtown that is San Francisco today projects a force field of resistance to genuine political and economic unity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Atlanta had elected its first black female mayor.", "keywords": ["francisco", "kneecapped", "clean", "female", "breed", "colleagues", "board", "shot", "san", "mayor", "black", "acting", "voted", "franciscos", "night", "london", "city"], "polarity": 0.017254120148856994, "subjectivity": 0.37698891751523333},

It was fairly windy, so maybe a gust had set off the car alarm, though no sound was coming from the car.\n\nThe car was parked in the driveway of the home, the outdoor Christmas lights were on and I could see that a light on the top floor was on, so I assumed that somebody was home. I thought to myself, \u201cI should hop out of the car and go ring their doorbell and let them know that their car lights are on.\u201d Lord knows, I\u2019d hate to wake up in the morning\u2014it was about 8 p.m. when I saw the car\u2014and find out my car battery was dead because the alarm was going off all night.\n\nI almost pulled up to the house right then, but I decided to drop off my daughter first. Should something go awry, I do not want my daughter there.\n\nShould something go awry.\n\nThat\u2019s literally the first thought that popped into my head. I wanted to let this family know that their car alarm was going off and that they might want to go see about it, and I was worried about what could go wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI dropped off my daughter at her mother\u2019s home, which is farther into the subdivision, so I\u2019d pass the house on my way back out. I told myself that if the alarm was still going off when I drove by again\u2014likely\u2014that I\u2019d get out and go ring their doorbell and let them know. It seemed like such a simple and neighborly thing to do. And here was where all of the true overthinking began.\n\nI pulled up to the side of the house and started to plan how I was going to go about telling them. For one, I had on all black, save for my maroon down jacket, with a black hoodie and black skullcap. It was about 15 degrees outside, so I wasn\u2019t taking any of that off and risking getting myself sick in order to let them know their car lights were blinking.\n\nThen I thought to myself, \u201cIf I go up to this door and ring the doorbell and wait, chances are they\u2019ll turn the light on so they\u2019ll be able to see me, but I\u2019m dressed as I am, and because of the positioning of the garage, they won\u2019t actually be able to see their car from their front door, so they could be suspicious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo maybe I\u2019ll just go ring the doorbell, walk back to my car quickly hoping that I beat them answering the door, maybe get into my car or stand there, and when they open the door, yell an entire concession speech about how I wanted to let them know about their car but didn\u2019t want to frighten them as a random stranger dressed in all black at their door at 8 p.m. on a really dark street\u201d\u2014seriously, this street needs streetlights in the worst way\u2014\u201cbut didn\u2019t want them to wake up to a car with a dead battery.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want them to think about having to step outside the door with me there and wondering if I was going to try to force myself into their home, so I walked away from the door.\n\nI was really thinking about saying all of that. Why?\n\nI did not want to end up shot or having the police called on me. Do I know if they had a gun? Or would have answered the door with one? No, I don\u2019t. But do I know that they wouldn\u2019t have? Nope. They didn\u2019t know me, and I didn\u2019t know them and it was dark outside and late enough to wonder who would be stopping by the house unannounced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI literally had all of these thoughts as I sat there and tried to strategize how to do them a solid and put myself in the least amount of harm\u2019s way.\n\nAnd you know what I did? I drove off. I felt bad for driving off. But I also felt like I had to think too hard on how best to make them feel comfortable as I tried to help them out, and how my trying to be nice required me to consider so many factors about myself and how I would present at the door.\n\nIt\u2019s ENTIRELY possible that I totally overthought the whole thing. Maybe I watch too much television or read too much\u2014a police officer told me that once when he pulled me over and I very slowly and deliberately told him what I was doing as I grabbed my wallet. I was pissed that he\u2019d mocked me when I was trying to make sure I made it home safely and he didn\u2019t shoot anybody that night because he feared for his life over a taillight in front of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Union Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recognize there was a time when I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about walking up to somebody\u2019s door, and if it had been summer and more well-lit outside, I would have without a second thought. But I\u2019ve read too many stories of trivial encounters gone all the way wrong. And I could see all the ways it could have happened in the few minutes I sat there pondering how I\u2019d do this. And it wasn\u2019t lost on me that, ultimately, I had to strategize a good deed so that this one did not go punished.\n\nUnder different circumstances, I\u2019d absolutely walk up to a door and alert somebody. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve done it in my own neighborhood\u2014one where I\u2019d think people would be more hyperaware of people coming to their door.\n\nChances are, even last night, nothing would have happened to me. I\u2019d have let them know, they\u2019d have checked out their car, thanked me and turned off the alarm, and we\u2019d all have gone about our lives. But I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who lived there or what they\u2019ve gone through in life. Or what they\u2019ve seen. Or if it was a cop who is always on high alert, or whatever.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A.

The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death.

See 1968 Olympians Tommie Smith and John Carlos, whose black-gloved fists set off a butterfly effect of good ole down-home racism and death threats against both of their families.\n\nSee former NBA players Craig Hodges and Mahmoud Abdul Rauf. Hodges couldn't even get a tryout after he used his position to ask then-President George H.W. Bush to help black communities. And Rauf's Mississippi home was burned to the ground after he protested the national anthem because of religious beliefs. Both Hodges and Rauf were in the prime of their careers when America turned its back on them. Hodges was forced to retire, and Rauf went from being one of the NBA's most electrifying guards to playing overseas at just 29.\n\nSo how did Colin Kaepernick, a highly paid, often injured, now backup quarterback end up securing his position with the San Francisco 49ers after he took a knee during the national anthem?\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement, that's how.\n\nFor all the old fogies who argue that the disruptive nature of BLM protest is not the way to implement social change, I argue that Kaepernick is the direct effect of that change. Before Kaepernick's protest, he was on the bubble, at best, for securing a spot on the team. He was coming off a disappointing 2015 season in which he was benched when he was healthy and placed at season\u2019s end on the injured-reserve list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll signs pointed to Kaepernick being cut or traded in 2016. In fact, talks between the 49ers and other teams were rumored to be in the works during the off-season. Nothing came of it, and in 2016 Blaine Gabbert, who took over for Kaepernick after week 8 of the 2015 season and is 8-27 as an NFL quarterback, was reported to be in a competition with Kaepernick for the starting job. An unhealthy Kaepernick coming off of a bad year is still light years better than Gabbert.\n\nThen, after two preseason games in which Gabbert took most of the snaps, Kaepernick sat during the national anthem.\n\nWhen asked about his protest, Kaepernick noted that he couldn't ignore issues of over-policing in black communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" he said. \"To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\"\n\nShortly after his protest, like the great martial arts legend Sho'nuff before him, Kaepernick became electric. His Afro grew to epic heights. His words on police brutality were succinct and pointed. His jersey became the highest-selling jersey in the NFL. If there was any doubt where Kaepernick stood before his protest, there was no doubt after.\n\nI don't believe that Kaepernick thought about his career when he took a stand. In fact, historically, he would have been sealing his fate by taking a stand. Hodges and Rauf where both in the prime of their careers when they protested and were subsequently blackballed by the NBA. Kaepernick simply did what he believed was right, and sometimes being right has unforeseen consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy protesting, Kaepernick firmly placed himself in the Black Lives Matter camp, and in doing so, he brought with him the force of those who are willing to move on your stadium. This is not a group of namby-pamby protesters who don't believe in the power of their voice. Like the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycotters before them, they are willing to be as disruptive as the law will allow. They will march, shout, barricade. They will lock arms and join forces. They will make sure that their collective voice is heard.\n\nDoes Kaepernick care about his football life? Not as much as he cares about the Movement for Black Lives. His protest is pure. The aftermath is about money because everything\u2014no matter what they tell you\u2014is always, always about money.\n\nDoes the 49ers brass care about the Movement for Black Lives? Who knows. What they do care about, and what they didn't want to risk in cutting him, is the public relations nightmare that would have ensued. There would have been protesters at every game. New head coach Chip Kelly would have spent every press conference talking less and less about football and more about the movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is the way BLM would have wanted it. This is a victory for a movement that people have been critical of since its inception. This movement not only kept one black man off the unemployment line but, by doing so, also kept a great spokesperson in a position to use his influence to bring about change. It helps keep the story alive.\n\nIn truth, Kaepernick and the BLM protesters are the physical embodiment of the painting that's hung in the collective living room of the black imagination for centuries. You know\u2014the one that shows the muscular black arm reaching down to pull up another outstretched muscular black arm. They needed each other. And while the work is far from over, never forget that when it comes to black protest in this country, America has a tendency to catch the vapors. That is, they hate you at the time of the movement, only to love you in the end. See Muhammad Ali. See Rosa Parks. And years from now, see Colin Kaepernick.\n\nStephen A.

In fact, we will never know which candidate could have earned the vote of Jessica Williams Nelson, a 29-year-old woman from San Francisco.\n\nThat\u2019s because on May 19, Williams Nelson was shot dead by a San Francisco Police Department sergeant, Justin Erb. Her death marked the third time since late 2015 that SFPD officers shot and killed black or Latino residents of my hometown.\n\nAs I see it, these killings represent a litmus test for the presidential candidates now wooing voters in California\u2019s Bay Area.\n\nMore directly: Do Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton know or give a damn about what\u2019s transpired for black people in the Bay Area in recent years? Are they aware that the black population of the city has declined from 13 percent to just shy of 6 percent of city residents between 1979 and now? If income inequality is a focus of the candidates\u2019 domestic-policy platforms, what do the candidates make of the fact that the median income for white San Francisco households is $104,000 annually\u2014and $29,000 for black San Francisco households? (I\u2019m deliberately excluding from these questions the presumptive GOP presidential nominee: His policy positions on race and criminal-justice issues, such as they are, amount to \u201cSupport the police.\u201d)\n\nIt is fair to ask if Sanders and Clinton are aware that San Francisco\u2014an oasis of culture and sophistication\u2014has become a hellscape of income inequality, obscenely high housing prices, police brutality and gentrification. For liberal candidates who espouse a commitment to leveling the playing field in education, housing, employment and criminal justice, it strikes me as odd, at best, that neither Sanders nor Clinton has explicitly called out the stark inequalities and blatant racial hostilities that exist in San Francisco, especially regarding the city\u2019s shrinking black population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders, currently in a tight race with Clinton in California, has been crisscrossing the Golden State in recent days, desperate to win the primary in spite of a deficit in raw votes and delegates that makes his bid for the Democratic nomination all but an impossible dream. Sanders recently told a largely black audience in Oakland\u2014the largest city in the East Bay, and a historically black enclave\u2014that making police reforms, legalizing marijuana and forcing the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate every instance in which a suspect dies in police custody is his plan to combat police brutality.\n\n\u201cUnlike in other countries, we do not have [law enforcement] culture that says shooting someone is the last response, not the first response,\u201d Sanders said during a May 30 appearance at Allen Temple, a community powerhouse in Oakland.\n\n\u201cToo often, the first response is lethal force,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t directly address the SFPD excessive-force cases, but in campaign stops nationwide since early this year, Sanders has incorporated broad police- and criminal-justice-reform platform planks after being confronted by Black Lives Matter activists on the subject.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton, too, hasn\u2019t explicitly mentioned the recent San Francisco police-related shootings during her stops in the Bay Area, but she has forged an alliance with parents of other black and Latino citizens killed by law-enforcement officers in American cities. During a visit to St. Paul Greater Church in Oakland on Sunday, Clinton told the predominantly black parishioners that she advocates criminal justice reforms, and an end to gun violence. She stopped short of criticizing police departments in Oakland and San Francisco for excessive force. And while Clinton, like Obama, has dipped into the deep well of money sloshing around in San Francisco to bolster Democratic Party and campaign coffers, it doesn\u2019t appear that these cases of cops out of control have penetrated the candidates\u2019 radar to a big degree.\n\nI\u2019m not certain if this represents a simple oversight on the part of both campaigns (which, to be fair, have to cover an immense amount of topical terrain during primary season) or a sign that Sanders and Clinton, equally, are fronting when they say they\u2019re committed to reforming the criminal-justice system and creating greater opportunities for blacks, Latinos and working-class Americans. San Francisco, a small city with enormously stark examples of all these social-justice topics packed into a small space, could be an ideal location for launching a concerted campaign (however rhetorical at this juncture) to inject policies and measures to level the playing field.\n\nAnd more than any other topic facing the nation\u2019s largest and most populous state, policing and criminal justice, particularly in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, are clear examples of inequitable systems that negatively affect blacks, Latinos and poor people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe killing of Jessica Williams Nelson, for instance, was remarkable for its similarity to other recent episodes of San Francisco police killing residents: notably, in the race and economic status of those who were killed\u2014poor and brown or black\u2014and in the murky justifications for the shootings provided by police officials.\n\nThere\u2019s the Dec. 2, 2015, case of Mario Woods, a 26-year-old black man, who was shot more than 20 times by SFPD officers who confronted him on a street in the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhood, Bayview. After a man nearby had been stabbed, police responded and found Woods a few blocks away, carrying a knife. After warning him to drop the knife, and after shooting Woods with bean bags, a phalanx of some eight officers surrounded him. Although Woods appeared to be walking away, officers fired dozens of rounds at him. Woods\u2019 death was caught on bystanders\u2019 mobile phone cameras and instantly went viral.\n\nThen, on April 7, 2016, Luis Gongora, a 45-year-old Latino man who lived in a tent in an alley in the city\u2019s Mission District, was shot multiple times by two police officers who responded to neighbors\u2019 complaints that Gongora had been behaving erratically. Police officials claimed that Gongora had \u201ccharged\u201d at officers while carrying a knife, though witnesses dispute that description.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese incidents happened all while blacks in San Francisco remain 7.1 times as likely as whites to be arrested and account for 40 percent of arrestees in the city, though the black population currently hovers just under 6 percent of the city\u2019s 860,000 residents.\n\nAt the same time, it is encouraging to see a new generation of black activists emerge from the crises. The hippy-fueled socialist and radical movements that characterized San Francisco\u2019s activist communities during the \u201960s and \u201970s, and the gay movement of the \u201970s and \u201980s, had all but vanished within the orgy of tech-industry-infused wealth that has poured into the city in recent years. But lately, street protests, sit-ins and social media campaigns from Black Lives Matter contingents in San Francisco, Oakland and other affiliated social-justice groups have revitalized San Francisco\u2019s progressive and rabble-rousing DNA.\n\nThe killing of Jessica Williams Nelson led to the firing of SFPD Chief Greg Suhr, and a petition to recall Mayor Ed Lee\u2014whom social-justice activists describe as a \u201cpuppet\u201d for the tech industry\u2014is gathering steam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, black activists like Cat Brooks of the BLM-affiliated organization the Anti Police-Terror Project said that complex, intertwined factors\u2014including high cost of living, income inequality and police abuse of black and brown residents\u2014have ignited a fire under young residents in the city and the Greater Bay Area. She isn\u2019t optimistic, however, that either Sanders or Clinton genuinely sees as an urgent priority the topic of police killing black and brown residents and related matters.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s responding to the issue of police terror unless they\u2019re forced to respond to police terror,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe fight to get Chief Suhr fired has been going on for years.\u201d Brooks described the current wave of anti-police-brutality fervor as having begun with the killing of Alex Nieto, 28, who died in 2014 after being shot more than 15 times by members of the SFPD after an officer claimed that Nieto aimed a \u201cTaser-like\u201d object at them.\n\nA rising coalition of organizations such as the Anti Police-Terror Project and the Frisco 5 is pursuing an agenda involving pushing for \u201ctop to bottom\u201d reforms of police departments in Oakland and San Francisco, no matter the outcome of the Democratic presidential primary, Brooks said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we want to know is this: What does it mean in the 21st century to keep communities safe?\u201d Brooks added. \u201cThe system now, which originated in slave-catching, doesn\u2019t work for black and brown people \u2026 we need to push to reimagine what 21st-century policing looks like.\u201d\n\nAmy Alexander, an award-winning writer and editor in Silver Spring, Md., is the author of four nonfiction books, including Uncovering Race: A Black Journalist\u2019s Story of Reporting and Reinvention.

{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/100-days-as-a-black-man-in-silicon-valley-1822522889", "title": "/100-days-as-a-black-man-in-silicon-valley-", "text": "My mother moved from Jamaica to America to start a new life. My deceased father was the first in his family to go to college, yet he became the first Black to get a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech. He also has three patents for fiber optic cables. My younger brother started his own company. I, too, wanted to create something, so I quit at my law firm, sold my dream car, and moved to the land of creation: Silicon Valley.\n\nThe first thing I had to do was find a place to stay. I found it very difficult to schedule viewings from Atlanta, so I visited for a week in December to lock down a place. I didn\u2019t know much about the plethora of neighborhoods, so I decided to stay as close to public transportation as possible. After much sorting through Craigslist, I found a nice Jewish woman in Noe Valley who is renting her son\u2019s room while he\u2019s away at college. However, her room did not become available until Valentine\u2019s Day, so I had to book a room on Airbnb for the first six weeks.\n\nI arrived in San Francisco (I know it\u2019s not Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s my article and makes for a better title) on January 4, 2015 and immediately went into hustle mode. My objective was to attend one event per night. I\u2019ll never forget that on January 8, 2015, I attended a tech networking event, and when I went to check in, the woman said, \u201cYou know this is a tech event, right?\u201d Obviously, she hadn\u2019t met many Black people who were interested in tech. And she is not alone.\n\nSay what you want about the South, but at least people have been exposed to Blacks in all fields. For many in San Francisco, however, the only Blacks they are used to seeing hang around the Tenderloin. And if you\u2019ve never been to the Tenderloin, don\u2019t be fooled by the name \u2014 there\u2019s nothing tender about it. The Tenderloin, or the TL, is basically Hamsterdam from The Wire. I am convinced everything is legal there. And I mean everything.\n\nThe defining part about the Tenderloin is the homeless population. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before in any city I\u2019ve ever visited or lived in. The only thing more gut-wrenching than the fact that many\u2014 dare I say most\u2014 of them are Black is the fact that so many rich people live here. The homeless problem is so bad that most have become desensitized to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that is to say, people in SF seem a little surprised to see a Black man who looks just like them?\u2014?full beard, hoodie, messenger bag, and Nike running shoes. I\u2019ve received those looks in other cities when I\u2019m wearing a suit, but no one has ever looked at me in amazement for wearing street clothes until I moved to SF.\n\nDressing the part isn\u2019t always enough to neutralize the \u201cthreat\u201d of being Black. I was walking through the Mission in broad daylight in my SF attire and saw an older White man and his wife leave a restaurant and walk up to their Tesla Model S. I asked him if he had a rare 40 kWh like the one I owned because I did not see a 60 or 85 decal on the back. I could tell he thought I was going to rob him. Needless to say, we didn\u2019t talk for long.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of people have been warm and welcoming because networking is key to survival. I know very few people who have lived in SF for more than five years, so everyone is trying to build their network. Also, people empathize with my story of quitting a job to move to San Francisco (could I have been any more cliche?). In addition to the traditional mediums, people here even network in a Lyft Line or UberPool. The ability to network is imperative because internal referrals make it easier to get hired and jobs for early-stage startups are essentially word-of-mouth only.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite many people only wanting to connect on a surface level, I have made some actual friends. I actually befriended a White guy at the same January 8 networking event who took me sailing and surfing for the first time. And I made two Black friends who are recruiters at tech companies while watching March Madness at a restaurant. Chance encounters like these happen all the time in SF.\n\nIn addition to it being easy to meet people because people like networking in SF, there\u2019s just more to do in this 7 x 7 mile city. There\u2019s always free events, such as movie screenings, art shows, app launch parties, and waffle giveaways going on. My favorite thing to do is attend concerts. Fortunately, SF is one of the few cities to have Jukely Unlimited, a service that provides unlimited concerts for $25/month.\n\nI\u2019ve seen everyone from Asgeir to Catfish and the Bottlemen to JMSN to Flight Facilities through the service. I didn\u2019t expect to see many Black people at any of those shows. I was, however, a little surprised that there were few Blacks when I went to see Just Blaze in SF or Prhyme in Oakland. I\u2019ve quickly learned there\u2019s no de facto critical mass of Black people in the Bay Area. If you\u2019re Black and want to meet people who look like you, you have to plan in advance because we are so spread out (see, Our Family Dinner, infra).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotice that I italicized the phrase \u201cand want to meet people who look like you.\u201d There are two types of Black people in tech: Black people who\u2019d prefer to see more Blacks in tech and Black people who\u2019d prefer to remain a unicorn. It\u2019s really easy to spot the difference. As stated above, people love networking in SF, even people with poor social skills. So, if meet someone and invite them to coffee or lunch and they make no attempt to even put a date on a calendar, I leave them alone.\n\nOther than the crabs in a bucket, I have no problem with Black people in the Bay Area. Blacks in Oakland frequently question why I would live in SF with people who don\u2019t look like me. I\u2019m not concerned about the racial makeup of my community. I care more about living in the center of the action, especially while I am looking for a job. To me, SF is worth the premium price and colder weather.\n\nDespite the longstanding dissension between Black in the Bay \u2014 at least from what I gleaned from a visit the African American Museum and Library in Oakland \u2014 I believe the Black professional community is very strong here. Black professionals in Atlanta often take our numbers for granted. Here, however, I was placed on a Young Blacks in San Francisco listserv before I even moved here. And I was one of hundreds of people who paid nearly $50 to meet other Blacks in the Bay at the \u201cOur Family Dinner\u201d event on February 21. Some attended to find a significant other (I actually know a married couple who met at a prior OFD) while others went to network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not care how connected you are, it is not easy to find a job in tech, especially if you do not know how to code. It\u2019s extremely competitive out here because you are competing with people from around the world. I moved here for legal or policy counsel positions with a tech company and/or startup. Positions with early-stage startups generate a lot of interest because of the possibility of equity in the next Facebook. Equity would be ideal, but I care more about using my legal and policy expertise to help grow a business, even if it is already public.\n\nThus far, I have had interviews for legal counsel with Skycatch, a drone startup, and the Wikimedia Foundation (nonprofit that runs Wikipedia). Words cannot express how grateful I am to even have made it to the interview process. I did not get either job, but I do not think it was because of my race. My gut feeling with Skycatch is that I wasn\u2019t hired because of my litigation background and they were looking for someone with more transactional experience. And I didn\u2019t feel good about the Wikipedia interview.\n\nI honestly feel like going to school in the South is a bigger strike against me than my race. People are aware that UNC-Chapel Hill is a great college, but few realize the University of Georgia is a Top 30 law school and Top 5 for my master\u2019s program. I even had to revise my resume to add the U.S. News rankings because I felt like I was getting overlooked by people who attended West Coast institutions. Unlike going to public institutions in the South, racial diversity can be seen as a good thing. Indeed, Apple just donated over $50 million to get more minorities and women into tech. Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz also has been actively working to increase the number of Black founders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also know that working at boutique firm is a strike against me. When companies say they want someone who works at a \u201ctop\u201d law firm, they mean a large law firm. However, it\u2019s a known fact that associates at smaller firms have more autonomy and responsibility than people at large firms. In fact, my old firm only hired former federal law clerks for its litigation team. I don\u2019t know of any large firm whose standards are that high.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there is a force to keep certain people out of tech, but I believe the problem is worse in private companies. In fact, at the Crunchies (think the Oscars for tech), a startup founder\u2019s wife told me that many investors will not invest in a company if there are too many non-Asian minorities and women at the company. I\u2019m sure Ellen Pao would agree with regard to discrimination against women. For Blacks in tech, we can only aspire to become Tristan Walker. And if you don\u2019t know who that is, you\u2019ve just proven my point (no hyperlink, google him for yourself).\n\nThe ironic thing is that despite meeting many people who fit the \u201cfounder profile\u201d (white and Asian men), I haven\u2019t met many people with truly disruptive business models. Rather, they just want to piggyback off something that has been done before (\u201cMy startup is like [insert successful company], but [insert meaningless distinction]\u201d). Not to toot my own horn, but I have good startup ideas. I just don\u2019t code well enough to build them by myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s precisely why there\u2019s a premium for engineers out here. A guy who used to work for Lyft told me that there was a $1,000 finder\u2019s fee for new employees, but $10,000 if you were an engineer. Kind of makes me wish I did not go to law school \u2026 or college for that matter. Seriously, why pay all that money for college when you can go to coding school for a fraction of the price, make over six figures, and get equity in a company? I definitely feel like my high school guidance counselor dropped the ball on that one.\n\nCoding is a language that should be taught in every school. Sadly, coding courses are not available at many schools, including ones in SF. That\u2019s why I gladly accepted a position on the board of Mission Bit, a nonprofit that teaches coding to public high school students.\n\nOf course, when you take tech out of the equation SF, is just like any other city. The weather is much different from the South. People back East tend to think of California as a whole, but the weather in Northern California is much different from Southern California. In fact, with the microclimates in SF, the weather can be significantly different just one mile away. The weather is dramatically warmer if you go to East or South Bay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next thing to surprise me is the difference in how women look. It\u2019s not uncommon to see women in full club attire at the Lenox Mall in Atlanta. The other end of the spectrum is SF, where many women seem to wear fairly androgynous clothing. Of course, women in San Francisco dress up, but it\u2019s reserved for special occasions, Temple Nightclub, and the Marina District (still haven\u2019t been to verify).\n\nThe last thing to surprise me has been the Christian community. Growing up, I expected to find nothing but \u201cGodless heathens\u201d in SF. In the \u201cBible Belt,\u201d people often claim to be Christian because it is part of the culture. Here, however, being Christian isn\u2019t as ingrained in the culture, so you have to be more intentional with it.\n\nThe churches I\u2019ve been to here also seem to be very involved in the community, especially with helping the poor. In fact, the first civic organization I joined was a YWAM Tenderloin ministry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomeless people need more than a meal or some money. They need people who are willing to make a long-term investment. And I intend on being here for the long haul. I\u2019ve had some life-changing experiences in SF, but nothing has been more transformative than walking around the Tenderloin at night and handing out hot chocolate to homeless people with YWAM. We engaged with people by learning their life stories, shaking hands, giving a hug of encouragement, and praying for them, if they requested it. That\u2019s what Christ requires of his followers, yet I had never even had an actual conversation with a homeless person until I ventured to the land of Godless heathens. Ironic, indeed.\n\nI visited Atlanta during Easter weekend and was angry for most of the time. I was angry that my mom lived so far from the city. I was angry that it was difficult to walk around Midtown. When I got to Midtown, I parked my car in a surface lot and was determined to walk as much as possible. After making a few stops to see friends, I eventually made it out as far as General Assembly at Ponce City Market (about 2.3 miles from where I parked). I then was angry that the tech networking event at General Assembly was overrun by people who were only there for the free beer.\n\nI get angry in SF, too. I saw a quote at the African American museum from Rep. Barbara Jordan that read, \u201cAll blacks are militant in their guts, but militancy is expressed in different ways.\u201d For me, militancy is best expressed by attacking the problem and not just complaining about it. I\u2019m furious about the homeless problem in SF, so I\u2019m working to do something about it. And I\u2019d like to see more Blacks in tech, so I started with myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarrod Jenkins received his JD/MPA from the University of Georgia. He currently resides in San Francisco.

A Madea Halloween grossed more than $28 million opening weekend, I stumbled upon an unfortunate lil\u2019 meme that compared that gross with the one earned by Nate Parker\u2019s The Birth of a Nation. There, Tyler Perry was referred to as \u201cTyler Fairy,\u201d and regarding why the Madea movie made more money, well, \u201cBecause we will support emasculation over our quest for liberation.\u201d\n\nOf course, that was typed in all caps because if there\u2019s one thing a homophobic fool loves more than being wrong, it\u2019s being wrong with a caps lock. As poorly made and thought out as the meme was, it was a visual representation of many thoughts flooding social media and, depending on the media outlet, headlines. Some of us just love us a good conspiracy even if makes absolutely no sense.\n\nComedies tend to perform better than historical dramas. Tyler Perry isn\u2019t some unknown entity; he has created an empire spanning varying facets of the entertainment industry thanks to a very sizable, loyal fan base. Most of that fan base consists of black women\u2014the same demo that majorly supported Nate Parker\u2019s movie.\n\nWith respect to the notion about supporting a film directed by a black man but released by a major Hollywood studio, uh, black people\u2019s liberation will not come by way of consumerism, let alone a movie. Imagery matters, but one would have to be an empty-headed sucker to believe that a film could dismantle systemic racism and white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kind of fool who makes homophobic, meaningless memes, I suppose.\n\nAs for the \u201cemasculation of the black man\u201d trope, that does remind one of previous statements made by Parker himself. That\u2019s why I take great pleasure in Moonlight, which explores manhood and gay black identity, as the critical darling many anticipated The Birth of a Nation to be. Both the Madea movie and Moonlight are enjoying success in their respective circuits.\n\nStill, for all of Perry\u2019s success over time, he recently revealed, \"I still have issues getting screens in white neighborhoods, believe it or not.\u201d He went on to add about his opening figures: \"I think the numbers could have been bigger had people who are in the white suburbs had the option to go to their own theaters to see it. It's something I've been dealing with for many, many years.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were also tweets like this one sent out by the Washington Post: \u201cMoonlight is about a poor, black, gay teen. But here\u2019s why it relates to everyone.\u201d\n\nMovies with predominantly white casts never, ever have their stories presented this way.\n\nBlack people, no matter their gender, sexuality or amount of duct tape used to play a woman in a comedy, still have to contend with prejudice on varying levels. Each of us continues to be limited in some way by other people\u2019s biased perceptions of who we are and what we\u2019re capable of. We all have our values judged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor months now, there\u2019s been this ongoing question about why we as black people need to support one movie over all others. It\u2019s always been a crock; only the inherent biases are grating to the nerve. In sum, your counterfeit-Confucius, dimwitted cousins that refuse to let go of The Birth of a Nation\u2019s perceived failure need to find the nearest tar pit and hop headfirst into it.\n\nThere will be other films where people run this same logic, but, ultimately, one thing will remain constant: If you don\u2019t celebrate all of us, and if you opt to pit us against one another, you\u2019re a divisive fool. That and you never really loved us no way.

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige in Mudbound (Netflix) Mary J. Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["unmaking", "talks", "lawrence", "j", "hair", "soul", "hairstylist", "netflix", "natural", "queen", "florence", "mudbound", "davis", "hiphop", "beautiful", "mary", "blige"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Blige, who is nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in Mudbound, that is undoubtedly the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Blige will upset the expected winner of that category, Allison Janney (for her performance in I, Tonya), but who could have imagined that Mary J. Blige would ever get to this point? That she would be hitting the Oscar red carpet as a nominee for both acting and music? For the rest of her career, she will be able to distinguish herself among her peers.\n\n\n\nNothing is impossible, but if you had told me, a die-hard Mary fan, five or 10 years ago, of this trajectory, I might\u2019ve instructed your trolling ass to get away from me.\n\n\n\nShe is the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, but as with many singers-turned-actresses, our expectations were limited. After all, this is the woman who played Ole Mae on The Jamie Foxx Show, Tanya on Tyler Perry\u2019s I Can Do Bad by Myself and Mom on Prison Song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, she was OK for the material she was given, though as much as I adore MJB, I had no idea \u201cMom\u201d would have made it as far as she has as an actress. There have been moments in which she was a\u2019ight\u2014say, in the TV film Betty and Coretta\u2014but I was pleasantly surprised at the level of depth she brought to the role of Florence Jackson in the Dee Rees-directed Netflix drama that has since earned her kudos from the academy.\n\nBlige can often appear awkward in interviews; blinking profusely, avoiding eye contact with the interviewer at times and being noticeably cautious about whatever she is going to say in certain instances. Those characteristics tended to transfer to her acting roles, sometimes making it difficult to remove Blige from whatever character she was portraying.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case in her portrayal of Florence. If anything, the way Blige employed that stillness, caution and underlying pain she carries made Florence all the more interesting to watch. As well done a film as Mudbound is, I found it hard to watch, given that it is a historical drama set decades ago against the present day, when a Nazi-sympathizing bigot currently occupies the White House. Blige made the film watchable for me because I was so impressed by her growth as an actress.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about that role in a New York magazine profile, Blige said, \u201cEveryone I see, they say, \u2018Oh, my God, you were so great. I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 They didn\u2019t know I had whatever they\u2019re seeing in me; they didn\u2019t know I could pull it off. To be quite honest, I didn\u2019t even know I did that good.\u201d\n\nNow she is up for several more roles\u2014including the upcoming Netflix series The Umbrella Academy. I say this with all sincerity: This should all be considered hope to artists-turned-thespians who many feel can\u2019t act worth a damn. No, I am not volunteering names. Talk among yourselves.\n\n\n\nMany of us turned to Mary J. Blige because she was a person in pain who managed to lend voice to ours. In an industry that often makes everyone disposable, but particularly aging black women, it has long been refreshing to see Mary J. Blige not only maintain in the industry, but as of late, thrive in new ways that will only extend her remarkable career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, we have since learned that her divorce from estranged husband Kendu Isaacs contributed to her raved-about performance. It has also sadly put her in a bit of financial peril.\n\n\n\nAs recently reported here, Blige made no money from her Mudbound performance and is paying off millions of dollars in debt. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Isaacs can fall dick first into the abyss. We trusted this man to make our girl happy, and look how gloriously he fucked up.\n\nStill, Mary J. Blige will be OK. She will tour. She will produce her own TV shows and films. She will, ideally, finally quit playing and give the streets the thigh-high boot line they crave from her. And, of course, she will continue acting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllison Janney may be taking the trophy Sunday, but considering all that\u2019s she been through and where her life is now going, Mary J. Blige will still end up the queen of the night. It won\u2019t have happened to a more deserving person. If she does manage to win the Oscar for best song, however, expect me to sob with your aunties about it on the next MJB tour.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "going", "j", "performance", "hate", "person", "win", "didnt", "oscar", "won", "say", "mudbound", "kendu", "mary", "blige", "probably"], "polarity": 0.20351895579168305, "subjectivity": 0.5285949320040227},

It was a balmy 69 degrees where I live, but there must be a reason I didn\u2019t get an invite. Probably the Mueller investigation.\n\nAnyway, Us Weekly reports that Hov and Queen Bey turned the garage at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles into an old-school Hollywood glamour lounge for around 150 guests who were sworn to secrecy, which upsets me even more, because I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Chateau Marmont.\n\nHonestly, I have no clue what the Chateau Marmont is, but had my invitation not been stolen by kids in the neighborhood, I could have found out.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite?

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["unmaking", "talks", "lawrence", "j", "hair", "soul", "hairstylist", "netflix", "natural", "queen", "florence", "mudbound", "davis", "hiphop", "beautiful", "mary", "blige"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Blige, who is nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in Mudbound, that is undoubtedly the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Blige will upset the expected winner of that category, Allison Janney (for her performance in I, Tonya), but who could have imagined that Mary J. Blige would ever get to this point? That she would be hitting the Oscar red carpet as a nominee for both acting and music? For the rest of her career, she will be able to distinguish herself among her peers.\n\n\n\nNothing is impossible, but if you had told me, a die-hard Mary fan, five or 10 years ago, of this trajectory, I might\u2019ve instructed your trolling ass to get away from me.\n\n\n\nShe is the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, but as with many singers-turned-actresses, our expectations were limited. After all, this is the woman who played Ole Mae on The Jamie Foxx Show, Tanya on Tyler Perry\u2019s I Can Do Bad by Myself and Mom on Prison Song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, she was OK for the material she was given, though as much as I adore MJB, I had no idea \u201cMom\u201d would have made it as far as she has as an actress. There have been moments in which she was a\u2019ight\u2014say, in the TV film Betty and Coretta\u2014but I was pleasantly surprised at the level of depth she brought to the role of Florence Jackson in the Dee Rees-directed Netflix drama that has since earned her kudos from the academy.\n\nBlige can often appear awkward in interviews; blinking profusely, avoiding eye contact with the interviewer at times and being noticeably cautious about whatever she is going to say in certain instances. Those characteristics tended to transfer to her acting roles, sometimes making it difficult to remove Blige from whatever character she was portraying.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case in her portrayal of Florence. If anything, the way Blige employed that stillness, caution and underlying pain she carries made Florence all the more interesting to watch. As well done a film as Mudbound is, I found it hard to watch, given that it is a historical drama set decades ago against the present day, when a Nazi-sympathizing bigot currently occupies the White House. Blige made the film watchable for me because I was so impressed by her growth as an actress.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking about that role in a New York magazine profile, Blige said, \u201cEveryone I see, they say, \u2018Oh, my God, you were so great. I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 They didn\u2019t know I had whatever they\u2019re seeing in me; they didn\u2019t know I could pull it off. To be quite honest, I didn\u2019t even know I did that good.\u201d\n\nNow she is up for several more roles\u2014including the upcoming Netflix series The Umbrella Academy. I say this with all sincerity: This should all be considered hope to artists-turned-thespians who many feel can\u2019t act worth a damn. No, I am not volunteering names. Talk among yourselves.\n\n\n\nMany of us turned to Mary J. Blige because she was a person in pain who managed to lend voice to ours. In an industry that often makes everyone disposable, but particularly aging black women, it has long been refreshing to see Mary J. Blige not only maintain in the industry, but as of late, thrive in new ways that will only extend her remarkable career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, we have since learned that her divorce from estranged husband Kendu Isaacs contributed to her raved-about performance. It has also sadly put her in a bit of financial peril.\n\n\n\nAs recently reported here, Blige made no money from her Mudbound performance and is paying off millions of dollars in debt. As far as I\u2019m concerned, Isaacs can fall dick first into the abyss. We trusted this man to make our girl happy, and look how gloriously he fucked up.\n\nStill, Mary J. Blige will be OK. She will tour. She will produce her own TV shows and films. She will, ideally, finally quit playing and give the streets the thigh-high boot line they crave from her. And, of course, she will continue acting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllison Janney may be taking the trophy Sunday, but considering all that\u2019s she been through and where her life is now going, Mary J. Blige will still end up the queen of the night. It won\u2019t have happened to a more deserving person. If she does manage to win the Oscar for best song, however, expect me to sob with your aunties about it on the next MJB tour.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "going", "j", "performance", "hate", "person", "win", "didnt", "oscar", "won", "say", "mudbound", "kendu", "mary", "blige", "probably"], "polarity": 0.20351895579168305, "subjectivity": 0.5285949320040227},

Now, I happen to like it. It was well-acted and moving and is probably the second-best Marvel movie after Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that\u2019s just me. All black people don\u2019t have to like the Black Panther movie; people like different kinds of movies. just as they like different kinds of ice cream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, what you can\u2019t do is be lactose-intolerant, walk into Cold Stone Creamery, complain that they didn\u2019t have a nondairy version of butter-cream confetti birthday cake, then write a thousand-word think piece on how the ice cream-industrial complex is misleading black folks.\n\nYet, like clockwork, late-night college-dorm cypher masquerading as revolutionary Twitter and blackademia are out in force saying that Erik Killmonger was right, that the Black Panther movie is anti-revolution and that the white dude got too much screen time. There are plenty of legitimate critiques of Black Panther, but these aren\u2019t those.\n\nLet\u2019s get the big one out of the way first: Killmonger wasn\u2019t right.\n\nI know that people are having #ExpressYourUnpopularOpinion orgasms on Twitter, and I get it; folks are out there hustling for contrarian hot takes on one of the most successful superhero films of all time to get clicks on their SoundCloud while blocking any disagreement. That\u2019s just social media. Doesn\u2019t mean that any of the critiques are right\u2014and most aren\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErik Killmonger (who is the best Marvel villain of all time, since Loki really doesn\u2019t count as a villain) defeats T\u2019Challa in ritual combat, takes over as king of Wakanda and Black Panther, and vows to use Wakanda\u2019s advanced weapons to arm oppressed black peoples all over the world.\n\nSome people found Killmonger\u2019s aims to be noble and that the Black Panther movie was overt propaganda against revolutionary politics. Or some academics felt that the movie demonized black American men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat black revolutionary thought are these folks reading?\n\nKillmonger\u2019s desire to free black people from oppression was noble, but his methods were ridiculous and his motives were questionable. Wakandans didn\u2019t resist Killmonger because of his ideas. They didn\u2019t agree with his methods, which were\u2014again\u2014ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack revolution in America hasn\u2019t failed because we don\u2019t have enough guns; it fails because white folks outnumber us 10 to 1, and that\u2019s in some major metropolitan areas.\n\nWeapons for self-defense or chasing the cops and the Ku Klux Klan out of your neighborhood are one thing, but going to war against the United States would mean the extermination of black people, no matter how many vibranium-shielded rhinos you shipped to Ferguson, Mo.\n\nNow, if Killmonger had wanted to turn Wakanda into a refuge for oppressed blacks across the globe, or bankrupt the imperialist powers in Europe and America by creating a single African currency based on vibranium, I\u2019m pretty sure T\u2019Challa would have at least been willing to check out a PowerPoint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThing is, though, Killmonger didn\u2019t have a good plan, no matter how his supporters try to spin it. More important, Killmonger\u2019s plan wasn\u2019t intentionally bad because film director Ryan Coogler wanted to discredit revolution; it was bad because there are still a lot of people dumb enough to think that black freedom in America can be achieved through direct combat. Peaceful Black Lives Matter activists get shot on the daily. What do you think would happen to a militarized black uprising?\n\nSpeaking of militancy, the notion that Black Panther is propaganda for incrementalist reform instead of wide-scale revolution can occur to you only if you didn\u2019t watch the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandans are part of a never colonized, ethnocentric, isolationist, theocratic monarchy. In other words, the country is run by a royal family that worships a magical cat, and they don\u2019t care about anybody or anything beyond their borders, regardless of race. Heck, M\u2019Baku points out that no Black Panther had visited Jabari-Land for a thousand years, and that was like a 15-minute Hoverbike trip from Panther Palace.\n\nHow would it make sense in this movie for this nation to move from isolationists to Pan-African revolutionaries in a few hours just because a guy dressed like Lil Fizz from B2K showed up with some fighting skills and a tattoo on his lip?\n\nKillmonger wants revolution, but only if he is in charge. W\u2019Kabi wants imperialism, and Nakia wants humanitarianism, and T\u2019Challa is figuring out how to move Wakanda forward and how to get his girl back. Which brings us to the white man in the middle, Agent Ross. Some critics felt the need to center him in the movie, and it\u2019s snarky and sloppy pop-culture commentary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reason Agent Ross is in Wakanda is that he took a bullet for the girl the king is sweating. Notice that the Wakandas weren\u2019t sharing Kimoyo beads with all those dead South Koreans lying around after Killmonger freed Klaue. After that, they called Ross \u201ccolonizer,\u201d locked him in a room, and when he volunteered to help overthrow Killmonger, Shuri, T\u2019Challa and Nakia gave him the collective, \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here?\u201d look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wakandans never trusted, embraced or fully accepted Agent Ross; he was caught up in a palace coup and proved to be useful. If you think Black Panther spent too much time on or gave too much focus to Ross, you probably think Get Out was really about Detective LaToya and the inner workings of the Transportation Security Administration, aka the TSA.\n\nHollywood doesn\u2019t make revolutionary movies, and even movies that \u201clook\u201d revolutionary are really status quo propaganda. In every Planet of the Apes movie, the monkeys that want justice and revenge on humanity, even after years of being experimented on and oppressed, are always the bad guys. In the X-Men movies, even though Magneto is right every. single. time., he\u2019s the bad guy. In Django Unchained, despite being a former slave himself, Django cares nothing about freeing others; all he wants is to get his wife back.\n\nIn other words, Hollywood movies only say violent revolution is OK if the oppressors are robots or aliens that we can\u2019t have sex with (notice why they had so much trouble in Battlestar Galactica?).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, none of these critiques apply to Black Panther. The movie isn\u2019t anti-revolution; it\u2019s about the best way for black people to carry out our obligations to one another, wrapped up in a coup and a bunch of computer-generated images and fancy costumes.\n\nKillmonger\u2019s goal was noble, but his methods were nonsense and ahistorical. Let\u2019s save the concern-trolling think pieces until the next Tyler Perry movie; those movies are much more worthy candidates for this kind of scorn.", "keywords": ["know", "revolutionary", "movie", "wrong", "black", "panther", "yall", "killmonger", "movies", "ross", "think", "revolution", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.025088763575605678, "subjectivity": 0.44868072960178224},

Thanks to films Get Out and Mudbound, several black folks are in the running for a coveted Oscar on the movie industry\u2019s biggest night.\n\nOne such nominee is the song \u201cMighty River\u201d from the Mudbound soundtrack, which is up for best original song. It\u2019s performed by Mary J. Blige (who is also nominated for best supporting actress\u2014there\u2019s no hateration in this here dancery), which means that it is entirely possible that she could land on the stage and do that Mary dance where she steps in staccato and does her hand wave on the way to the podium. This needs to be a thing.\n\nWhat the nomination of \u201cMighty River\u201d also means is that Raphael Saadiq\u2014who, for my money, is the most underappreciated R&B artist of all time\u2014is now an Oscar-nominated musician. As the composer and co-writer of the song, Saadiq could possibly knock out a Mary dance of his own should \u201cMighty River\u201d win.\n\nI recently had the opportunity to talk to the most famous of the Tonys about his career, the Oscar nomination, what he listens to when running and how he manages to show up in all the spaces the bougie black folks are congregating in.\n\n(Also, he read the article about being underappreciated and knew it was me who wrote it. I can\u2019t stress enough how awesome it is when people you\u2019re fans of read the things you write about them, remember them and talk to you about them. Mama, I made it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: The interview was edited for brevity and clarity.]\n\nOn whether he gets excited at being nominated for awards and accolades like the ones he\u2019s getting for \u201cMighty River\u201d:\n\nSome of them, though I\u2019m grateful for anything. It\u2019s cool to be honored, but I like to keep my head down and enjoy my life, and if honors come my way, then I appreciate them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his own musical legacy and how he maintains longevity in the music game:\n\nI\u2019m such a fan of music and not feeling bitter of getting the accolades. I know how good I am. My peers know how good I am. Honored that anybody would listen to me, so there\u2019s no peer pressure to be great for the sake of my legacy.\n\nOn never being boxed in musically and managing to be involved in so many recent projects that have caught on with the black community, like Insecure and Underground:\n\nI\u2019ve always stayed a fan of music and act like the last project never happened. It allows me to take chances. To stay fresh and pick music for Insecure, for example, I keep my ears to the street. Again, I\u2019m a fan of music. You know, we toured with N.W.A back in the day as a band, and I used to talk to and hang with those guys. [Ice] Cube told me back then that he was going to do movies. We\u2019ve done it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Instant Vintage, one of the best R&B albums ever released, and \u201cAsk of You\u201d as one of the most representative songs of the \u201990s:\n\nWith Instant Vintage, you know, I never wanted to be a singer. I was always the bass player, never the lead singer. I wasn\u2019t scared to be in the front, but it seemed like a lot of work. I learned that from being in gospel choirs and quartets and my experience watching people. I was trying real hard to not be a solo act. For instance, I left the Tonys when I did \u201cJust Me and You\u201d; it was my first solo record, though the label required it to be credited as Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!\n\nBut in order to keep making music I had to do a solo record. I was in a lonely place, never having done a solo record, and wondered how people would take me and the music. I wondered if I\u2019d be successful or if the critics would tell me I needed to go back to the group. When I did \u201cAsk of You\u201d for Higher Learning, I required that they use my name. Basically, Instant Vintage was me making my Here, My Dear [Marvin Gaye] record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Lucy Pearl, another classic, and the use of Hunstville, Ala., HBCU Alabama A&M University\u2019s band on the record and whether he attended and met Dawn Robinson there:\n\n[Laughs.] That was a joke. I never went there. One of the folks in the band did and he was the connection so we brought the band in for the album.\n\nOn working with Solange on A Seat at the Table and if they knew they had a pivotal album on their hands:\n\nWe knew A Seat at the Table was special, but we didn\u2019t know it was gonna hit people until it got out. Solange was so into editing and producing. You know, you don\u2019t have to try to be hot, just try to be good and that becomes great, then becomes legendary. It\u2019s OK to think about being good. If you\u2019re good, it reaches people, and that album became a vessel for folks who have day jobs and work and are trying to figure out life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn what he\u2019s listening to and who his favorite artists are:\n\nOh man, I listen to old school, to new school. Artists like Chocolate Milk. Neil Young to Al Green. And Minnie Riperton. I love Kamasi Washington, Rick Ross and Lil Wayne. I love hip-hop. Like [Pete Rock & CL Smooth\u2019s] \u201cThey Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.).\u201d When I was a kid I wanted to be a kid who played at the fire hydrants in New York, like in Harlem. I loved brownstones. Songs like \u201cThey Reminisce\u201d remind me of brownstones and the feel of hip-hop. I run to Wu-Tang. [Laughs.] My favorite artists are Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder and D\u2019Angelo.\n\nOn upcoming projects:\n\nI\u2019m working on a new album. I recently changed management, so hopefully I\u2019ll have an album out by the end of this year. It will feature lots of styles. I\u2019m leaning more toward a heavy bass-line album, so it will be a more fun record.", "keywords": ["know", "talks", "saadiq", "exercising", "record", "folks", "musical", "music", "black", "legacy", "oscar", "album", "wutang", "nominated", "solo", "vsb", "good", "mighty", "raphael", "band"], "polarity": 0.2710634821009094, "subjectivity": 0.5364703933017888},

While Black Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe product, it\u2019s still a black movie. From Ryan Coogler to Wakanda to kente cloth in videos to the two capital letters and the apostrophe in the lead character T\u2019Challa\u2019s name, there\u2019s no denying the blackness at play here.\n\nAnd like peanut butter and jelly, Shaq and Kobe, and salt and pepper, black movies aren\u2019t complete without a soundtrack. Can I get an \u201camen\u201d? I think I got an \u201camen.\u201d Do you know why? Because God is good (all the time) and all the time (God is good). Tell me you didn\u2019t say that out loud just now. It\u2019s OK\u2014I know. I did too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201990s were full of movies with great soundtracks. Faizon Love once joked that soundtrack budgets back then were bigger than the budget for the actual movie. Not surprisingly, most of those soundtracks were as good as, if not better than, the movies themselves. From Boomerang to Above the Rim to Waiting to Exhale, black movie soundtracks came, saw and conquered. Just last weekend, I got into a full debate about the best black movie soundtrack, though we included blaxploitation movies, so of course the soundtracks for Superfly and The Mack were name-checked. Dear The Mack, I choose you. See what I did there?\n\nSince the \u201990s, though, short of a few movies here and there like Brown Sugar and Love & Basketball, black movies haven\u2019t been as heavily soundtrack-focused as they used to be. You can chalk that up to the fact that the black movie market, while thriving on an independent level\u2014shouts to Amazon Prime and Netflix\u2014isn\u2019t as commercially poppin\u2019 as it once was outside of Tyler Perry, T.D. Jakes (occasionally) and Spike Lee.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a movie, in all honesty, that really lent itself to dedicating an entire soundtrack of new material to it. T.I. made his 2006 classic album, King, the de facto soundtrack for the movie ATL. Jay-Z did something similar with American Gangster, but it just hasn\u2019t been the same since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Black Panther, the movie that has black folks across America forgetting that we\u2019re all about to make Mickey Mouse a whole lot of money and he will not be fixing the hood in the process. Like most black folks, I\u2019m excited for this movie, and I was waiting for this soundtrack to drop because, I mean, we got us a black movie with a black soundtrack again. In Black History Month, no less. This couldn\u2019t get any blacker unless Allen Iverson\u2019s mother started braiding his hair at the movie theater while he watched Black Panther.\n\nSo what about the actual soundtrack, P?\n\nOh, right. With Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar) quarterbacking the project, it features lots of names you know and many you probably don\u2019t. More than half of the TDE roster shows up (Kendrick, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and SZA), and current heavy hitters like the Weeknd, Travis Scott, 2 Chainz, James Blake, Anderson .Paak, Vince Staples, Khalid and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd show up alongside lesser-known but talented artists like Zacari and Jorja Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is this a good soundtrack? Seems like that depends on whom you ask. My first few runs through the project\u2014at this point, I\u2019ve listened to it roughly six times\u2014is that it\u2019s fair to middling. \u201cAll the Stars\u201d is head and tails the best song on the album, so it\u2019s not surprising that it was the single. I like a few other songs, like \u201cThe Ways,\u201d \u201cRedemption,\u201d \u201cSeasons,\u201d \u201cBig Shot\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d \u201cX\u201d took repeated listens, so I\u2019m not sure if I actually like it or if I\u2019ve been incepted. I don\u2019t care much for the rest of the songs. One run through social media might have you believing that I\u2019m sniffin\u2019 glue, though. I don\u2019t sniff glue, by the way.\n\nObviously it\u2019s too early to tell how this will fare in the black-movie-soundtrack pantheon. Plus, making it over the Above the Rim mountain is almost an impossibility. I think the sound of the project as a whole is interesting; Sounwave really made his presence felt. But I think our soundtracks from the \u201990s were so iconic and we have so much nostalgia built into them that I\u2019m getting misty-eyed thinking about the Sunset Park soundtrack, and I can\u2019t name more than two songs off of it from memory (at the moment).\n\nBut we pretty much got another Kendrick Lamar album, and that\u2019s never a bad thing. The themes are interesting, to say the least, because of what the movie seems to be about, and there are several places on this album that are fairly standard-issue trap-nigga fare. Not sure how that fits with the theme of Black Panther, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLargely though, it\u2019s good to have a movie, especially one with as big a budget and as much commercial appeal as Black Panther, get the black-movie-soundtrack treatment.

She originally filed for divorce in July 2016, and the pair have been locked in a bitter dispute over money ever since, with Blige claiming in the recent court documents that Isaacs looks at her like she\u2019s his \u201cbank.\u201d\n\nThe Queen of Hip-Hop Soul also asserted that she\u2019s been in dire financial straits.

There is one song where every single time I listen to it, I get sad for what could have been\u2014at the same time, I also feel fortunate for having grown up in a time where I got to experience a rapper who was so good at what he did\u2014and that\u2019s \u201cKick in the Door\u201d (a song with a beat that Puffy famously didn\u2019t like). \u201cKick in the Door\u201d is Biggie\u2019s lyrical beatdown to \u201cthose that choose to use disrespectful views on the king of NY.\u201d\n\nThat song should be studied in classes about creative writing for how perfect the wordplay is. And \u201cI Got a Story to Tell\u201d? Bruh. Easily one of the top five greatest stories on hip-hop wax ever. And truthfully, I could go song for song on both of his albums and talk about how his lyrics and craft are unparalleled, but to know Biggie is to already know his talent. Even Born Again, his posthumous release, featured \u201cDead Wrong,\u201d which, good gracious. One day, I promise you, I listened to it 20 times in a row.\n\nI won\u2019t say that there aren\u2019t other MCs who are as capable as Biggie. We\u2019ve had a few; Jay-Z comes to mind, and who can forget other cats like Andr\u00e9 3000 and even Prodigy from Mobb Deep, who I don\u2019t think gets nearly the credit he deserves? But if you take the best assets of the best rappers to ever do it, Biggie had at least an above-average mastery of each of them. He had personality, wit, lyrics, flow, swag, humor, edge and every other characteristic you could want in a rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery year on March 9, we celebrate him; it\u2019s been 21 years since he passed away. And every year, when I listen to my Biggie albums, I still find myself smiling and appreciating his gifts and what he did give us while he was here. He impressed me with his skills, something that only a few rappers have ever done. Any rapper would be smart to attempt to emulate him. He had it all.\n\nWe\u2019ll always love Big Poppa.", "keywords": ["song", "impresses", "albums", "notorious", "life", "aka", "big", "good", "wordplay", "later", "21", "biggie", "impressed", "rapper", "jay", "mc"], "polarity": 0.23452737077737076, "subjectivity": 0.5515837403337402},

This year, though, many of us have given the proverbial middle finger to the league (and need prayer), which means that this Sunday, Super Bowl Sunday, is going to be interesting. While I\u2019ve not had or gone to a huge party every single year, I\u2019m used to the camaraderie of the day and watching commercials and talking shit with people about whatever suits the moment in a festive environment.\n\nBecause I believe in the spirit of togetherness and fellowship, I do think it\u2019s possible to have a \u201cSuper Bowl party\u201d that doesn\u2019t actually include watching this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Plus, we all know how this story ends. Sunday night\u2019s news alert:\n\nTom Brady and Bill Belichick win their sixth Super Bowl together as the New England Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles 28-17 in Super Bowl LII, a result reminiscent of Super Bowl XXXIX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo how are we supposed to have a Super Bowl Party without the Super Bowl?\u201d\n\nGlad you asked.\n\nAlso, no judgment if you are watching the Super Bowl\u2014especially if you\u2019re from Philadelphia. I get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Make it a black-movie night.\n\nIf you are unaware of the black movies that live on Netflix and especially on Amazon Prime Video, you are missing out. And they\u2019re not all trash, either. Some are actually decent. Might I suggest any of the movies that star or feature actor Murda Pain? It\u2019s Black History Month; instead of watching black bodies subjecting themselves to violence on the football field, why not watch a black movie like Plug Love or Crown Heights (actually a REALLY good movie)?\n\n2. Make it a spades night.\n\nWhen was the last time you brought a gang of folks over to your house to play spades? If you have enough people, you are guaranteed to have several who can\u2019t play\u2014perhaps you can do a social good and hold a spades beginners course. My 9-year-old daughter knows how to play tunk. This should embarrass some people. While you\u2019re doing this, you can watch black movies. See No. 1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Make it a general game night.\n\nHave folks bring over their favorite games. If you\u2019re feeling froggy, even break out the chessboard and see who got the skills in the room on the boards. I suck at chess, but I\u2019ll whip everybody\u2019s ass in Parcheesi or Sorry! Bring those, too!\n\n4. Have a big-ass Black Card Revoked party.\n\nConsidering that you\u2019re not watching the Super Bowl, likely in the name of blackness, this could be interesting, seeing as how you JUST might find out how bad at blackness some of your friends are. Somebody you know has the game plus all of the expansion packs (I\u2019m that guy\u2014or was until I left them in the capital of African America, Atlanta). This can be a fun way to revel in blackness while ignoring the television, unless it\u2019s showing I Am Not Your Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Watch I Am Not Your Negro.\n\nThe documentary on James Baldwin just came on PBS the other night, so somebody DVRed it. I forgot to do so, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a heart in the house tonight who wouldn\u2019t mind hosting as long as somebody brings the right amounts of foodstuffs\u2014and nobody is gonna have to pay. Then have everybody sit around and discuss the film and Baldwin, and for shits and giggles, see how many of your friends can actually NAME a book or play written by Baldwin. They should win a prize.\n\n6. Make it a karaoke night.\n\nSince everybody else will be watching the Super Bowl, why not rent out a room at a karaoke spot and screech your way through three or four hours of top 40 singles with drinks. And if your room has a television in it, turn it to BET or TV One and watch, well, not the Super Bowl.", "keywords": ["watch", "actually", "somebody", "black", "youre", "watching", "room", "ways", "spades", "bowl", "super", "enjoy"], "polarity": 0.14996045621045617, "subjectivity": 0.5048989898989898},

Hip-hop made the leap, R&B was blessed with several noteworthy groups that provided classic albums, and neo-soul showed up and made superstars out of folks like Erykah Badu and D\u2019Angelo.\n\nNew jack swing took a step out of the arena but gave way to artists with hip-hop and R&B sensibilities, creating party anthems with boom bap and harmony from groups like SWV, Mary J. Blige and BBD. Black movie soundtracks and hoods across America could be heard knocking to Blige\u2019s \u201cReal Love\u201d in their Jeeps alongside Redman\u2019s \u201cTime 4 Sum Aksion\u201d and Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cLet Me Ride.\u201d\n\nWell, 1995 brought us one of the seminal offerings in hip-hop/R&B perfection: Groove Theory\u2019s \u201cTell Me,\u201d from their self-titled (and only) album. For my money, \u201cTell Me\u201d is one of the most \u201990s songs that ever did \u201990. Groove Theory was a duo featuring Mantronix\u2019s Bryce Wilson and the woman whose voice could save the world and who instantly became #Bae for thousands, Amel Larrieux. With Bryce\u2019s production and Amel\u2019s vocals and writing, \u201cTell Me\u201d showed up and had everybody hitting the same ol\u2019 two-step for the culture.\n\nWhy is the song perfect? Glad you asked. Let\u2019s start with the production. Wilson used a simple drum pattern, threw in some \u201cChristmas bells\u201d and added the bass line from the Mary Jane Girls\u2019 \u201cAll Night Long\u201d (hence the Rick James writing credit), which he chopped up a bit. The beat itself is super early to mid-\u201990s in its simplicity. Wilson adds some keyboard flourishes, but there isn\u2019t much to the beat at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s fine, because the real power of the song lies in the simple songwriting and Amel\u2019s powerhouse vocals, which are embellished with Trey Lorenz\u2019s additional vocals throughout to provide some tension. She demonstrates quite a bit of vocal range and even does a run to start the song, but largely, her voice is so buttery and beautiful and perfect over the boom-bap drumming that she has all the room she needs to let the singing breathe. While the lyrics aren\u2019t exactly changing the world\u2014it\u2019s a song about a crush\u2014they\u2019re very effective, especially the \u00fcber-repeatable hook. I mean, who hasn\u2019t been there? I\u2019ve been there.\n\nAmel sells the song with tremendous aplomb; \u201cTell Me\u201d IMMEDIATELY takes you back to the \u201990s. Nobody who was into the black-music scene during that time can hear that song without immediately remembering how the \u201990s felt. You might not remember where you were or what you were doing when you first heard it, but you remember the feel. Any song with that kind of power is nothing short of a perfect moment in black-music history. It gives you life. It takes you back to your youth and your crushes, the \u201990s style and the possibilities of it all.\n\nThe video was helmed by \u201990s staple director Hype Williams, which means that the label felt that they had a hit on their hands. The song ended up reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and as high as No. 2 on various other Billboard charts. It\u2019s a performance video with lots of shots of Amel and Bryce, though we all focused on Amel. Oddly, even the album cover faded Bryce into the background. I think we can safely call that shade and possibly foreshadowing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf ever I feel any bit of nostalgia or desire to relive the \u201990s, I almost always start with \u201cTell Me.\u201d It never lets me down.

Blige at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z accidentally teased a joint tour. Bey\u2019s Facebook and Ticketmaster pages revealed a concert date for a previously unannounced stadium stint: Monday, July 30, at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field. Press caught it, her team deleted it and we never thought about it again ... until Tuesday, when two anonymous sources confirmed to Billboard that the tour is definitely real, but Bey can\u2019t talk about it because of Coachella.\n\nHmmm.\n\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned two sources told the pub, and I quote, \u201cA hold for the tour had been placed at a number of North American stadiums.\u201d This is exciting, to say the least: The last time a Jay-Bey tour happened was in 2014, their infamous On the Run Tour. It\u2019s been two new albums (J\u2019s 4:44 and B\u2019s Lemonade) and four years since, and I\u2019m hungry for more, goddamn it.\n\nSo why can\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z spit out the good news and ease our troubled minds? Coachella might really be to blame\u2014Bey is headlining the festival this year, performing on Saturday night both weekends of the Indio, Calif., event: April 14 and 21.\n\nHistorically, Coachella\u2019s parent company, Goldenvoice, has required its big talent to hold off on any tour announcements until after the event, which makes sense: If I\u2019m only trying to see Bey and a few other acts, it\u2019s much, much, much cheaper to wait until she comes near me, and I get to avoid Coachella, which seems unbearable. Win-win, y\u2019all.\n\nIf she (and her husband, lest we forget) waited until the Monday following the end of Coachella, April 22, as Billboard points out, they\u2019d still have 98 days to announce, sell tickets and market the Philadelphia show. That\u2019s a lot less lead time than other tours of this size, but they could be prepping for it right this very second, so who knows?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, they probably don\u2019t need to make the same preparations as other artists, so let \u2019em do whatever they want\u2014as long as we get the tour.

It\u2019s the second time this has happened in the past two years. The first time, it was under very different circumstances; to be honest, being let go from a gig that caused me very real emotional and mental stress was kind of a relief. This time, after a day of moping, I could only ask: \u201cOK, Universe, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nStill, everyone wants to be in control of their destiny. No matter what the reason, it can be a real blow to be told that your boss is eliminating your position\u2014or worse, just handed a pink slip with no conversation whatsoever; just an end date and a smile. But Beyonce gave us the blueprint for how to make lemonade out of lemons, and while losing your full-time gig is never easy\u2014believe me, I\u2019m living it\u2014here are five action steps to take after being let go:\n\n\n\nFeel What You\u2019re Feeling\n\nListen y\u2019all, when you get called into your boss\u2019 office for that conversation about your position ending, there are a bunch of feelings that come with it. Even if you\u2019d already been planning to leave, you may feel demeaned, embarrassed, sad, angry, and maybe even a bit relieved.\n\nGetting fired is difficult because everyone wants to leave a situation on their own terms. Keep this in mind, though: You get to be in your feelings for as long as you need to. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you to \u2018suck it up\u2019 or push you to smile when you simply don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s healthy to feel pain and sadness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly\u2014especially in those first few days after receiving the news\u2014avoid destructive urges to either ignore your feelings or numb them. The worst thing you can do when you\u2019re devastated is attempt to eat, drink, smoke, or screw away your feelings. Feel your feelings and work through them. Sit with them. As they say, there\u2019s no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone. You need to be healthy for that next step.\n\nPull Your Community Close\n\nHopefully, you have a squad that loves you and wants to see you win. So when you get that pink slip, pull your community in close. When I learned that my contract was not renewed, the first thing I did was tell my squad. And if you have a crew like mine, then you have at least one of each of these three types onboard: an Olivia Pope-style strategist, a Cleo-type ride-or-die, and your very own Molly, who is your day-one shoulder to cry on\u2014and all of them are your biggest cheerleaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour strategist will help you reach your best self. She\u2019ll devise a 10-point strategy for your next step. She\u2019s the one who might even have a short-term hook up to give you a little cushion between now and your next full-time gig\u2014your real glow up.\n\nYour ride-or-die? She\u2019ll amp you up with fantasies of slashing tires and breaking out windows. Her purpose is to remind you of how great you are. If you\u2019re angry, then she\u2019s angry. And while she may have a drink with you or smoke with you, she won\u2019t let you wallow, \u2018cause you\u2019re her girl and ain\u2019t nobody gonna keep you down for long.\n\nYour day-one shoulder to cry on is the sista that will love on you, no matter what. Hugs, tears on her shoulder, and plenty of \u201cI love you, sis, you got this\u201d are always at the ready. Emotion is her middle name, and you can express all of yours with her. She\u2019ll also gently nudge you to take a walk while talking and encourage you to see your therapist because she knows you need a little push to get you back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while your friends are always there for you, keep in mind that they need a break now and then, too. When that happens, let the professionals take over: Seek out a bodyworker, yoga class, Reiki specialist, or acupuncturist to do some healing outside of your friend circle. You deserve it.\n\nRevisit Your Exit Plan (or Start One)\n\nI\u2019ve written about exit plans before, but have since learned firsthand that sometimes a pink slip will interrupt even the best exit strategy. Don\u2019t throw your exit plan away, though; instead, update and retool it (your squad will come in handy here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you have two weeks or 90 days left on your contract, but no matter the length of time you still need to think about your next step. What thrills you? What have you always wanted to do, but were too afraid to go after it? Explore those new options.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started an exit plan, this is a perfect time! You\u2019re leaving anyway, so think big! Since we all have bills, you might have to find a temporary gig to get you to your next great thing, and that\u2019s where gathering your contacts becomes critical!\n\nGather Your Contacts\n\nUnless you\u2019re the type of person that\u2019s trampled over everyone in your wake and burned every bridge, there\u2019s a solid possibility that colleagues in your field have heard of you, your good work, and want to support your success. Let your contacts know you\u2019re looking and that you\u2019d love their help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn is a good spot to do this via direct message, but if you know them well, talk to them face-to-face over coffee or tea. Be open to new opportunities that may come your way. Your contacts may need your skillsets in a way you never envisioned. If you have a specific path in mind, make sure you pull those contacts first. You may not get a new job right away, but plant those seeds, and they\u2019ll grow.\n\nExit With Dignity\n\nWe all have those fantasies of destroying expensive computers, slapping your cube-mate who clipped their fingernails at their desk, and cursing out the boss as you walk away like Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale, throwing a match behind you. And yes, you and your ride-or-die may have joked over brown liquor about really putting a hurting on someone, but no. Stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of leaving after getting the pink slip is doing so with your dignity intact. Yes, that flip-out scene from Jerry McGuire is appealing, but ain\u2019t nobody got time for that, and gossip spreads quickly. The best thing to do in the time you have left is to shore up your projects and move on. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re better than this gig. Don\u2019t beg your supervisor for another chance or to reverse the decision\u2014and definitely don\u2019t badmouth your coworkers. Keep it cool. Do your job and keep it pushing. Also, you should start to think about what you\u2019ll say in your next interview. Be honest, but also reflect on what you learned from the experience. Thank your boss for the opportunity, ask for feedback (if you feel up to it), and pack your stuff.\n\nI\u2019ve been fired twice in my life. This second time, I already had an exit strategy. Still, there\u2019s nothing like wanting to leave on your own terms. As I reflect on my next steps, the emotion that I have to tackle is fear. Fear of going backward, fear of failure, fear of regret. Job security is real. And we all got bills to pay. But safety isn\u2019t part of my exit strategy, and it shouldn\u2019t be part of yours, either. When the universe opens a door, we just need to walk right on through it. And y\u2019all, I\u2019m running through mine!", "keywords": ["exit", "strategy", "youre", "let", "thing", "fired", "youve", "need", "job", "slip", "dont", "feelings", "real"], "polarity": 0.1328659534909535, "subjectivity": 0.44230755355755347},

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

And how about an \u00fcber-talented hairdresser like Tym Wallace scrutinizing your every move via a super-closeup iPhone app for moviemakers? You would be flawless, that\u2019s what. Don\u2019t take my word for it, though; see for yourself when Proud Mary,\n\nTaraji P. Henson\u2019s latest star vehicle, hits the big screen today, Friday, Jan. 12.\n\nTo celebrate the film\u2019s release\u2014and all things hair\u2014Wallace, along with hair-care brand Creme of Nature, recently hosted a bevy of beauty editors in the penthouse suite of 60 Thompson, a sexy little boutique hotel in New York City\u2019s SoHo neighborhood.\n\nChampagne and high tea were served while Wallace\u2014who had just wrapped a publicity shoot in the adjacent suite of rooms\u2014emerged and took his place at the center of the circle to tell the tale of how he built the hair story for Henson\u2019s titular role as Mary. \u201cNot since Pam Grier have we seen a role like this on film,\u201d he said.\n\nClad in all black, with a razor-sharp brushed fade and a flute of Champagne at the end of his Yakuza sleeve-tattooed arm, he proceeded to hold court with a nod to the current national mood: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see women taking their power back,\u201d declared Wallace as the room raised their glasses in agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace\u2019s reading of the script for Proud Mary, directed by Babak Najafi, led him to create hairstyles so closely interwoven with the plot that he could scarcely reveal the number of hair changes, for fear of spoiler alerts. Wallace explained, \u201cContract killers move in mystery and in silence\u2014the outside world is not supposed to know the personality of a killer.\u201d\n\nThe role had many challenges: creating a look that was simultaneously fly, incognito and capable of standing up to the physical demands of Henson performing many of her own stunts. Wallace\u2019s tactic was simple: \u201cKeep it minimal,\u201d killing it with a series of high-end human-hair wigs.\n\nTo hold those $575-a-piece human-hair wigs in place during filming, his adhesive of choice was spirit gum, specifically from WM Creations in its matte finish. Wallace, who has been looking after Henson\u2019s tresses since the two met in 2015, does not like using glue for wigs; he feels it damages the hair and doesn\u2019t clean up easily with 99 percent alcohol, the way spirit gum does. He\u2019s a fan of buying French hairpins by the pound to secure wigs and pieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re doing with your hair, Wallace maintains that edge care is a major issue\u2014certainly, removing and regluing wigs twice a day takes its toll. His No. 1 weapon in the war on edge erosion is his own \u201cspecial concoction\u201d of oils, including Jamaican black castor, jojoba, tea tree and coconut oils, adding a dash of lavender oil to neutralize the smell of the castor oil.\n\nAs for working with Henson, Wallace says she\u2019s the kind of client \u201cI prayed for. She\u2019s hilarious and she lets me do anything and everything to her hair.\u201d But one thing Wallace won\u2019t do is leave a weave in longer than two months without taking it out for a one-week breather and mandatory maintenance, which always includes trimming split ends. \u201cOne bad petal kills a whole flower; same for split ends in your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also cautions against braiding hair too tightly, citing an epidemic of traction alopecia he\u2019s been seeing lately, due to braiders who are so deft at their craft they can \u201ccatch and braid your eyebrows!\u201d\u2014a truth that made the room erupt in laughter. But Wallace got serious as he slid his signature glasses down his nose, peering sincerely at the editors gathered: \u201cTell your braider not to touch your edges, and give those braids some slack.\u201d\n\nFor everyday edge care, he advises using edge-taming products that don\u2019t list alcohol as the No. 1 ingredient. He also swears by tinted gels to boost the shine and luster of edges, giving that extra touch of #BlackGirlMagic. According to the Wallace gospel\u2014where hair is a \u201crelatable form of ministry\u201d\u2014tips for maintaining straight hair include using leave-in conditioner and heat-protectant products.\n\nNow in his 12th year as a hairdresser, he\u2019s happy to see that so many women have had a come-to-Jesus moment and joined the natural-hair movement.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness.

Armed with this unanticipated cash, the still-homeless and aggressively underemployed Earn invests it in a gift card scheme suggested by Tracy, a recently paroled houseguest of Paperboi\u2019s, who claims that Earn will be able to double the $4,000 he just received. The plan fails, of course, as Earn is only able to use the card at the mall for 20 minutes\u2014not nearly enough time to receive an $8,000 return on it.\n\nI cringed a little at this entire scene. Not because of how predictable it was that the scheme wouldn\u2019t work, but because it didn\u2019t feel believable. Someone as smart and naturally skeptical as Earn is supposed to be wouldn\u2019t have just immediately handed over all that money. It just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nCounting the 10 episodes in season 1 and the two so far in season 2, there have been 12 episodes of Atlanta. I\u2019ve watched each of them. A few I\u2019ve watched multiple times. And this is the first time, in that 12-episode span, that I felt like a plot point just didn\u2019t quite fit. I\u2019m bringing this up not to nitpick, but to articulate exactly how high the show\u2019s bar is.\n\nWith most shows\u2014even most good shows\u2014these types of missteps happen more regularly. Maybe a character does something that character just wouldn\u2019t have done in that situation. Maybe a reference is dated or completely off. Maybe a part just wasn\u2019t cast right.\n\nEven The Wire, often (and rightly) cited as the gold standard of televised authenticity, had points when you were like, \u201cNah.\u201d One that comes to mind was in season 1, when strip club owner Orlando and an undercover Kima are attempting to bust Savino, and Orlando is driving around listening to Black Star. Which is just not what that guy in that situation would have been listening to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best part about Atlanta, and the reason it\u2019s both my favorite show and the best show on television, is that it always gets those details right. The language is right. The jokes are right. The beats are right. The casting is right. The music is right. The slang is right. The wardrobe is right. The latent economic anxiety, and how that drives every decision, is right. Their feelings about and reactions to the numbing mundanity of violence and the Kafkaesque nature of the criminal-justice system are right.\n\nIt also exists without exposition, which is rare for such an intentionally esoteric show. There\u2019s no explaining what certain jokes and references mean. Unless, of course, the explanation provides an opportunity for something like the extended \u201cFlorida Man\u201d vignette. And this lack of time spent holding the audience\u2019s hand allows those details to breathe.\n\nLeigh-Ann Jackson of the New York Times addressed this in her recap Thursday:\n\nTracy\u2019s wave cap expertise is where the episode gets its name, \u201cSportin\u2019 Waves.\u201d Watching these guys sit around sharing laughs and potshots about a hair care phenomenon that\u2019s pretty unique to black men\u2014without expounding on its nuances for the benefit of a wider audience\u2014felt like witnessing a secret handshake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of Atlanta\u2019s audience is undoubtedly made up of the type of white people it parodies and skewers. There are likely hundreds of thousands of white people watching this black-ass show. Perhaps millions. Which, according to Donald Glover, is kinda the point.\n\nBut while he and the rest of the show\u2019s creators are very cognizant of that perpetual and pervasive gaze of whiteness, they don\u2019t pander to it. At least not in a way that gets in the way of the show. Atlanta is a secret and exclusive handshake that doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019ve never seen a dap before.", "keywords": ["white", "work", "wouldnt", "earn", "thing", "television", "best", "season", "gets", "atlanta", "right", "maybe", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.15468528825671685, "subjectivity": 0.49328294721151844},

I\u2019d seen her achieve as much in her other films with far less capital behind them than the history-making, $100 million budget that Disney provided this time, so there was no question that this film would be gorgeous.\n\nI was expecting Oprah Winfrey to blow my mind playing Mrs. Which, the wisest being in the universe, dressed as an intergalactic angel with gravity-defying Kim Kimble hair. And I was expecting Storm Reid, the wide-eyed, curly-haired 14-year-old star of the film, to break boundaries of the imagination for other children about what a fantasy-film hero looks like.\n\nBut I was not expecting this film to be retroactively healing for this 32-year-old black woman who grew up feeling shut out of a genre I love.\n\nAt the Los Angeles press screening of the film just days before the world premiere, DuVernay surprised the audience by showing up to introduce it. \u201cLet your inner child watch this movie,\u201d she instructed, and I obeyed.\n\nWithin minutes of Storm\u2019s appearance on-screen with her sweet face, African nose and natural hair, I surprised myself when I started to tear up. Sure, it\u2019s upsetting that her character, Meg Murry, is being bullied by teachers, students and her principal over the mysterious disappearance of her father into another dimension; and yes, the film is rich with inspiring messages of overcoming evil with love and light that tug on every heartstring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t why, by the end of the film, I was alternating between wiping away full-on tears and letting them fall, uninterrupted. It took a moment for me to understand what was being released in that theater.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, I was a budding child actress growing up in Virginia who\u2019d landed representation with the New York City talent agent famous for discovering Tom Cruise: Toby Gibson. I had filmed my first SAG-AFTRA-qualifying gig as a guest star on the PBS show The Puzzle Place, had two callbacks for the part of Bethany on the ABC drama Second Noah and was thrilled out of my mind to lose the role to the little girl from Crooklyn (Crooklyn!). Things were looking up for my fledgling career. Then my military father was relocated to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and everything changed.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Brooke Obie\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFolks weren\u2019t checking for young black actresses in Nebraska. Besides a Wow! potato chips commercial that never aired, and an infomercial for a product to protect your computer from the inevitable crash of Y2K (aww, the \u201990s!), all the parts I auditioned for went to children of a whiter hue. So I tried my hand at theater and was accepted into the local children\u2019s company. But even there, I had little success, playing nameless background roles. In one production, they had me playing one of many \u201cNative American children.\u201d I shudder to remember what that entailed.\n\nSo when the company announced that they\u2019d be putting on the play based on one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time, in my 12-year-old mind it was a sign. I couldn\u2019t help but kill an audition for Meg\u2014a bullied middle school kid who didn\u2019t fit in but who gets to fly, gets the guy and gets to be the hero. I read for the part and put into my audition every drop of emotion I\u2019d felt being isolated as the only black girl in a sea of white classmates and teachers every day. Finally! This Midwestern nightmare was going to serve a greater purpose.\n\nNot quite.\n\nWhen they announced the casting of a white girl with brown hair and glasses as Meg\u2014just like in the book\u2014I remember thinking, \u201cOf course.\u201d I was more disappointed in myself that I had even thought I had a chance at the role. Black girls can\u2019t be Meg. Black girls don\u2019t belong here. Not even in fantasy. I wound up playing a part so small that it\u2019s not even listed on the SparkNotes character list online, so I can\u2019t recall it now. I quit acting after that production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would take another 14 years before I would begin to challenge the limits that had been put on my imagination as a child, including that experience. By 2016 I\u2019d published my first novel, a reimagining of American history, about a black teen girl who escapes from her enslaver, the first president, and starts a revolution.\n\nWhen agents, editors and publishing houses said they couldn\u2019t imagine an audience wanting to read such a story, I laughed. Their limits were no longer mine; nor were they shared by the readers I\u2019ve met across the country and in the United Kingdom on tour. Book of Addis wound up winning literary awards for fiction. Pushing through those limits and achieving my definition of success with my novel, I thought that meant I was healed.\n\nAnd then I found myself bawling in a Disney theater as Sade sang \u201cFlower of the Universe\u201d at the end credits of A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, black children need to see this film so they can know that they, too, can be heroes. Yes, all children need to see this film\u2014especially boys\u2014so they can know how to follow the lead of a black girl. But I needed to see this film, too.\n\nTwelve-year-old me needed to see beautiful black Storm Reid be Meg and be an outcast and deal with depression and be a hero anyway and travel through space and fly. Twelve-year-old me needed to see Oprah speak life into that little girl\u2019s fear and low self-esteem and say that if she just finds the right frequency, she, too, can fly. Twelve-year-old me needed Ava DuVernay to create the space for all of that #BlackGirlMagic to shine on-screen.\n\nAnd by creating that space, DuVernay wrinkled time, found that little girl in the \u201990s who had been trapped for years in a white void and flung the escape hatch wide open.

Then she learned more about the hardships black filmmakers face getting their content picked up by streaming services. She quickly realized that there wasn\u2019t a lack of content, but a void of platforms. So she figured: Why not create one?\n\nSoon after, KweliTV was formed.\n\nThe streaming platform, similar to Netflix or Hulu, allows monthly subscribers unlimited access to more than 200 indie films from nearly 150 creatives across Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as black communities in Europe and North America. The goal is for KweliTV (kweli means \u201ctruth\u201d in Swahili) to give emerging independent creatives an opportunity to get their work shown\u2014especially to the audiences who look like them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also an opportunity for us to just learn more about each other,\u201d she says. \u201cAs black people in the U.S., we should be able to learn about Trinidad, or South Africa or Brazil through media arts, and that\u2019s what KweliTV strives to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter two years, KweliTV boasts more than 2,000 monthly, paid subscribers and nearly 20,000 online members\u2014and those numbers continue to climb. For black visual artists struggling to move beyond small film festivals, it\u2019s a much-needed avenue for securing additional viewership.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many avenues for nonwhite, independent filmmakers to be seen, so KweliTV has the potential to be a game changer for those of us who have struggled finding places to showcase our work,\u201d says Charysse Tia Harper, a longtime filmmaker with three films on KweliTV, including a look at Trinidad\u2019s carnival and a documentary on one man\u2019s mission to offer one family $1-per-month housing for a year.\n\n\u201cKweli allows us to celebrate who we are and our diversity while showing off what our emerging creators in the Diaspora can do,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom challenging all-white award shows to the lack of diversity among executives, Hollywood\u2019s boxing out of black cinema is no secret. According to a 2016 study (pdf) from the Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative at the USC Annenberg School, of the 100 top-grossing films of 2016, 47 had no black or African-American actors. And just 5.6 percent of the 900 films analyzed since 2007 were led by a black or African-American director.\n\nStreaming services, while providing more opportunities for mainstream viewership, have not been nearly as much of a reprieve for budding black filmmakers as many might have hoped. Not only have platforms like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com faced backlash for whitewashing minority characters, but many filmmakers say it\u2019s still much harder for black creators to get streaming services to buy in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile it hasn\u2019t always been my personal experience, just like any profession, black filmmakers often have to work twice as hard,\u201d Harper says, \u201cand with streaming services, the cost alone for them to host your content can box a lot of filmmakers of color out.\u201d\n\nBut Spencer is quick to clarify that KweliTV isn\u2019t a dumping ground for projects rejected by mainstream platforms. She and her team of four screen up to five films a week, using strict guidelines, before projects ever appear on the site.\n\n\u201cGenerally our criteria is that the project has to have been screened in a least one film festival, or some type of peer review,\u201d she says. \u201cBut even then we review films to make sure they fit what KweliTV is trying to do: be a catalyst for underrepresented perspectives in black media to be seen and heard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means subscribers will likely never see reality TV, melodramatic stage plays or other content that Spencer says \u201cperpetuates dangerous stereotypes of black people,\u201d whether it be excessive documentaries on violence in Latin America, poverty on the African continent or gangster films in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\u201cHollywood provides enough of that,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to show there\u2019s more to us than these predictable narratives. We want character, not caricatures.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting KweliTV off the ground hasn\u2019t been easy. The company is still mostly made up of a small team of dedicated producers and filmmakers united in their mission. Spencer herself says that she invests her own salary back into the company. But with KweliTV\u2019s popularity soaring, Spencer is thinking several steps ahead.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to eventually have our own awards entity that specifically recognizes excellence in black independent films,\u201d she says. \u201cRight now, you pretty much expect that any mainstream film with a majority-black cast or audience is going to be nominated for staple black awards, whether it\u2019s Soul Train, BET or NAACP Image Awards. But there\u2019s little out there that recognizes our own independent artists.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s flattered by the Netflix comparisons, Spencer says \u201cthe black Netflix\u201d is not a moniker she chooses to embrace. She likens Netflix to a modern-day Blockbuster, merely a vessel that houses content, whereas KweliTV attempts to immerse everyone within a community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d she adds, \u201cbeing \u2018the black\u2019 anything isn\u2019t really a compliment. We\u2019re better off when we recognize that being black is enough.

Given the success of Ryan Coogler\u2019s entry into the MCU, the publication asked Feige about the future adventures of T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), Shuri (Letitia Wright), Okoye (Danai Gurira), and Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o).

I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role. (Watson is a perfectly capable actress, just #NotMyBelle.)\n\n\n\nLuckily for all of us, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s star has only continued to rise, with British Vogue now hailing her as Britain\u2019s \u201cbreakout star\u201d on its April cover.

Armed with this unanticipated cash, the still-homeless and aggressively underemployed Earn invests it in a gift card scheme suggested by Tracy, a recently paroled houseguest of Paperboi\u2019s, who claims that Earn will be able to double the $4,000 he just received. The plan fails, of course, as Earn is only able to use the card at the mall for 20 minutes\u2014not nearly enough time to receive an $8,000 return on it.\n\nI cringed a little at this entire scene. Not because of how predictable it was that the scheme wouldn\u2019t work, but because it didn\u2019t feel believable. Someone as smart and naturally skeptical as Earn is supposed to be wouldn\u2019t have just immediately handed over all that money. It just didn\u2019t work for me.\n\nCounting the 10 episodes in season 1 and the two so far in season 2, there have been 12 episodes of Atlanta. I\u2019ve watched each of them. A few I\u2019ve watched multiple times. And this is the first time, in that 12-episode span, that I felt like a plot point just didn\u2019t quite fit. I\u2019m bringing this up not to nitpick, but to articulate exactly how high the show\u2019s bar is.\n\nWith most shows\u2014even most good shows\u2014these types of missteps happen more regularly. Maybe a character does something that character just wouldn\u2019t have done in that situation. Maybe a reference is dated or completely off. Maybe a part just wasn\u2019t cast right.\n\nEven The Wire, often (and rightly) cited as the gold standard of televised authenticity, had points when you were like, \u201cNah.\u201d One that comes to mind was in season 1, when strip club owner Orlando and an undercover Kima are attempting to bust Savino, and Orlando is driving around listening to Black Star. Which is just not what that guy in that situation would have been listening to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best part about Atlanta, and the reason it\u2019s both my favorite show and the best show on television, is that it always gets those details right. The language is right. The jokes are right. The beats are right. The casting is right. The music is right. The slang is right. The wardrobe is right. The latent economic anxiety, and how that drives every decision, is right. Their feelings about and reactions to the numbing mundanity of violence and the Kafkaesque nature of the criminal-justice system are right.\n\nIt also exists without exposition, which is rare for such an intentionally esoteric show. There\u2019s no explaining what certain jokes and references mean. Unless, of course, the explanation provides an opportunity for something like the extended \u201cFlorida Man\u201d vignette. And this lack of time spent holding the audience\u2019s hand allows those details to breathe.\n\nLeigh-Ann Jackson of the New York Times addressed this in her recap Thursday:\n\nTracy\u2019s wave cap expertise is where the episode gets its name, \u201cSportin\u2019 Waves.\u201d Watching these guys sit around sharing laughs and potshots about a hair care phenomenon that\u2019s pretty unique to black men\u2014without expounding on its nuances for the benefit of a wider audience\u2014felt like witnessing a secret handshake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of Atlanta\u2019s audience is undoubtedly made up of the type of white people it parodies and skewers. There are likely hundreds of thousands of white people watching this black-ass show. Perhaps millions. Which, according to Donald Glover, is kinda the point.\n\nBut while he and the rest of the show\u2019s creators are very cognizant of that perpetual and pervasive gaze of whiteness, they don\u2019t pander to it. At least not in a way that gets in the way of the show. Atlanta is a secret and exclusive handshake that doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019ve never seen a dap before.", "keywords": ["white", "work", "wouldnt", "earn", "thing", "television", "best", "season", "gets", "atlanta", "right", "maybe", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.15468528825671685, "subjectivity": 0.49328294721151844},

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially \u201cRobbin\u2019 Season\u201d now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but season 2 is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbie \u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nSeason 2 looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

These people are scared of something\u2014irrelevance, anarchy, immigrants, black people, aliens, Black Panther Build-a-Bears\u2014and this fear drives them to amass arsenals and fight against even the idea of any sort of restriction. They attempt to spin this fear-based reluctance as a fight for their freedoms, but we don\u2019t believe them. They need more people.\n\n\n\nI addressed this dynamic two weeks ago when trying to make some sense out of Parkland, Fla.\u2014and Sandy Hook, and Columbine, and Las Vegas, and Orlando, Fla., and wherever the next mass shooting will happen:\n\nWe are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies. But we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them. This fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nNaturally, there was some pushback from people who don\u2019t believe that fear\u2014specifically, fear possessed by white conservatives\u2014is what\u2019s driving our gun control problem. And some of their points and arguments were so compelling that I considered reconsidering.\n\nBut nah.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nKeeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from harm is perhaps our strongest human motivation, deeply embedded in our very DNA. It is so deep and important that it influences much of what we think and do, maybe more than we might expect. For example, over a decade now of research in political psychology consistently shows that how physically threatened or fearful a person feels is a key factor \u2014 although clearly not the only one \u2014 in whether he or she holds conservative or liberal attitudes. Conservatives, it turns out, react more strongly to physical threat than liberals do. In fact, their greater concern with physical safety seems to be determined early in life: In one University of California study, the more fear a 4-year-old showed in a laboratory situation, the more conservative his or her political attitudes were found to be 20 years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm.\n\nWith this in mind, John Bargh (the author of this piece) and three of his colleagues (Jaime Napier, Julie Huang and Andy Vonasch) conducted an experiment in which they turned conservatives into liberals by simply asking the conservatives to pretend that they weren\u2019t controlled by fear.\n\nBut before they answered the survey questions, we had them engage in an intense imagination exercise. They were asked to close their eyes and richly imagine being visited by a genie who granted them a superpower. For half of our participants, this superpower was to be able to fly, under one\u2019s own power. For the other half, it was to be completely physically safe, invulnerable to any harm.\n\nIf they had just imagined being able to fly, their responses to the social attitude survey showed the usual clear difference between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 the former endorsed more conservative positions on social issues and were also more resistant to social change in general. But if they had instead just imagined being completely physically safe, the Republicans became significantly more liberal \u2014 their positions on social attitudes were much more like the Democratic respondents. And on the issue of social change in general, the Republicans\u2019 attitudes were now indistinguishable from the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, if we could somehow find a way to convince conservatives not to be so fucking scared of every damn thing, they\u2019d be better people.\n\nThis seems like a daunting task. Perhaps even impossible. But if they were able to convince themselves that we\u2019re subhuman superpredators, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to convince them that they\u2019re Black Panther.", "keywords": ["snowflakes", "scared", "act", "experiment", "social", "physically", "attitudes", "way", "republicans", "theyre", "ones", "terrifies", "baby", "fear", "little", "safe", "conservatives", "proves"], "polarity": 0.11385949441505, "subjectivity": 0.45019106407995285},

From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become.

It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["song", "moments", "heard", "nina", "music", "history", "black", "simone", "released", "introduced", "women", "perfect", "simones", "mississippi"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

And she was every bit the bombshell birthday girl, looking snatched for the gawds in a glimmering golden gown.\n\nThat morning, she kicked off her personal new year by unveiling her brand-spanking-new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an honor well-deserved by the woman whose accolades include nine Grammy Awards (and 31 nominations) and 10 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nOf course, Blige is no stranger to high style or red carpets\u2014though we\u2019d be lying if we said that her recent glow up doesn\u2019t feel extra special.

It\u2019s always a wonderful thing to see your heroes win; but for a star who\u2019s remained as relatable as Blige, it\u2019s also inspiring to see her continue to channel her worst moments into her best performances, as she shared with Variety magazine:\n\n\n\nI used a lot of my own heaviness from my own misery that I was living in that horrible marriage ...

The show quickly became a career launching pad for its core cast: Far-out buddy Lakeith Stanfield traveled to the sunken place; sometimes-girlfriend Zazie Beetz is in surefire blockbuster Deadpool 2; upstart rapper Brian Tyree Henry got some guest spots on How to Get Away With Murder, This Is Us and Drunk History, not to mention a role in that Barry Jenkins-directed James Baldwin adaptation; and Donald Glover got gigs as Star Wars\u2019 Lando Calrissian and The Lion King\u2019s Simba, in addition to making the aphrodisiac of our time in \u201cRedbone.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are also the awards and recognition that Atlanta itself got, including two Emmys (outstanding director and outstanding lead actor in a Comedy Series for Glover) and two Golden Globes (best comedy and best actor in a TV series\u2014musical or comedy).\n\nBut no matter how many creative lives Glover might live, there\u2019s always going to be a special attachment for Atlanta. On paper, it\u2019s a buddy comedy equipped with woke-era expectations. At its beating core, Atlanta\u2019s first season is about the real absurdities black America must navigate daily. The black Justin Bieber bit doesn\u2019t work only in the sense that\u2014heh heh\u2014of course actual Bieber isn\u2019t black. It\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t fathom Bieber getting away with what he has if he were black.\n\nAfter a year-and-a-half layoff, Atlanta returns with a bit more menace (it\u2019s officially \u201cRobbin\u2019 Season\u201d now) while thankfully doubling down on the loose folkloric charm that gave it definition. Within the season\u2019s early episodes, we get introduced to the myth of the Florida Man\u2014a creature who lives for anti-blackness\u2014and rollick through a plot that takes us through a robbery, a surreal white-music outreach program, a gift-card scam and Sportin\u2019 Waves. There\u2019s a golden gun thrown in somewhere, too, but Atlanta retains a clear-headed sense of pacing that gives the chaos fluidity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtlanta\u2019s first season paid little attention to its core plot: Earn\u2019s (Glover) desire to manage his cousin, rapper Paper Boi (Henry), in an effort not to be broke. That lack of focus was sort of the point\u2014in Atlanta, ennui and absurdity live in tight proximity\u2014but season 2 is hinting at more motion on that front. The sophomore run gets its title from the sense of desperation that awakens during the holiday season. It\u2019s not quite the backbone, but Glover and Henry\u2019s nuanced performances really sell it as subtext.\n\nThe season makes sure to note that Earn needs Paper Boi, not the other way around. When Earn tries to assure Paper Boi that a visit to a very white music startup will be good\u2014in the same frail tone coaches use to cling to moral victories\u2014the perpetually annoyed star responds: \u201cIf you say so. I\u2019ll see all that when I get that check, tho.\u201d The sentiment escapes with a gravelly mumble, like a demand muffled by familial courtesy. Like with a lot of Atlanta, much is said with little.\n\nAnd like the first season, Robbie \u2019 Season benefits from a layer of specificity. The Sportin\u2019 Waves pomade has been used by African-American men for decades, yet Atlanta\u2019s second episode is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen the joy and futility of that experience gifted with its own subplot. In a letdown many black men personally know, Paper Boi\u2019s ex-prisoner friend\u2014played endearingly by Khris Davis\u2014realizes the sense of power his waves emanate only goes so far in white spaces, no matter how juicy they are. Atlanta also makes its way around to the concept of trying to save money at the strip club, a scene that could be read as a response to Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanfield\u2019s Darius consistently comes through with the loony yet profound one-liners, while Beetz\u2019s Van remains a warm presence\u2014though she doesn\u2019t pop up until episode 3 this time around. Atlanta is built around a likable cast, a charm that should invest the audience in a season that looks like it\u2019ll have no trouble subtly reminding you of the stakes (see the music: Tay-K\u2019s \u201cThe Race\u201d is a clash of boyishness and violence, much like the robbery it pops up in; Rene and Angela\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be Good\u201d soundtracks the guest appearance of Katt Williams, who, of course, is in a no-good coupling).\n\nSeason 2 looks like it\u2019ll press violence, disaster and surrealism into a claustrophobic microcosm, a curious mix that looks promising for what was already one of cable television\u2019s most groundbreaking shows.

They had already done a great job, so it was really cool to just get our fingerprints on there a bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere you have it. Those scenes where Shuri delivers those delicious one-liners to T\u2019Challa (aka \u201cWhat are thoooooose\u201d)? The Glovers likely had a hand in creating them\u2014and only needed a few hours. I\u2019m also willing to bet they punched up some of M\u2019Baku\u2019s lines, too, but that\u2019s just my own pet theory.\n\nGlover also talked a little bit about his role as Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story.\n\n\u201cAll the Star Wars are fun, but [with] this movie, we know what\u2019s gonna happen \u2026 we know they\u2019re not gonna die,\u201d Glover said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to have a lot more fun than in the other movies, where you have to deal with a lot of lineage and what\u2019s going to happen. I think this movie\u2019s just a fun, summer film.

The film has been applauded by black people across the world for touching on the complex relationships between Africans and African Americans, for serving up positive images of African culture for global audiences, and for providing a vehicle that allows black people throughout the world to showcase their heritage and their pride.\n\n\n\nAs a recent article from The Intercept explains, this influence has shown up in Brazil in the form of rolezinho pretoi, which roughly translates to \u201cblack stroll,\u201d in which large groups of Afro-Brazilians turn up together to walk about an area. The stroll has a recent history of being a form of protest in Brazil.\n\nIn the Intercept piece, one group of Afro-Brazilians coordinated a rolezinho to watch Black Panther at one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most exclusive high-end shopping malls, Leblon. As the writer notes, Leblon is couched in one of the most affluent areas in Brazil and is also a predominantly white space in a country where the majority of the population now identifies as black or mixed race.\n\nThis made the Black Panther screening as much a political act as a celebration.\n\nFrom The Intercept:\n\nOrganizers would start an event on Facebook and call for everyone to meet at a certain mall at a certain time. Young, mostly dark-skinned residents of the city\u2019s poor and working-class neighborhoods on the urban periphery would take a sometimes one- or two-hour train or bus ride to shopping centers in the bougiest enclaves and just go for a walkabout. In some cases, thousands showed up, much to the horror of Brazil\u2019s white elite, whose ever-present racial and class-based fears were palpable. Malls, including Shopping Leblon, closed down in anticipation of these protests. Others were broken up with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rolezinho for the global blockbuster, then, was a way to celebrate blackness in a highly visible way, to reclaim a highly segregated and exclusive space.\n\nReinaldo Junior, an actor who participated in a recent rolezinho, told The Intercept, \u201cWe wanted to occupy this space today to say, \u2018We are alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe almost never see any of our people in this kind of space. It\u2019s as though this space is only meant for white people,\u201d said Lucin\u00edo Janu\u00e1rio, another actor. \u201cSo when we have a film written by black man, with black actors and black producers, we felt it was our duty to occupy this space so we could serve as an example.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYgor Marinho, a 28-year-old student who participated in the recent rolezinho and watched Black Panther for the first time, said that the movie\u2019s black-majority cast filled him with pride.\n\n\u201cIt makes me want to win. It makes me want to fight. It makes me like myself more, like my own skin tone, like my kind of hair, like the shape of my nose, like the shape of my lips, like myself more,\u201d Marinho told The Intercept, \u201cbecause you start to see people who are like you, and you see how they carry themselves\u2014empowered, happy with themselves\u2014and you start to like yourself better.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "inspires", "brazilians", "intercept", "rolezinho", "black", "recent", "panther", "occupy", "space", "spaces", "start", "shopping", "whitedominant", "makes"], "polarity": 0.11405685932001719, "subjectivity": 0.4190486316802105},

You know I rock with you. You\u2019re my man 100 grand. But why are you devoting an entire explainer to the difference between two words I can just go and find in the dictionary?\n\nThank you for the kind words! I should tell you, though, that this explainer is actually about the colloquial use of \u201chungry\u201d and \u201cthirsty,\u201d not the standard definitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, I see. I never should have doubted you. Just like I never should have eaten that microwaved sashimi for lunch today.\n\nShit. I need to hurry with this explainer, then, because you\u2019re gonna die soon.\n\n\n\nAnyway, in a colloquial sense, \u201cthirsty\u201d and \u201chungry\u201d both mean the same thing. Each term is a way of articulating a person\u2019s ambition. Where they differ is in connotation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so?\n\n\u201cHungry\u201d describes an ambition that\u2019s rooted in integrity. It implies hard work, diligence and dedication. You\u2019d advise any person attempting to achieve a goal to be hungry. \u201cThirsty,\u201d however, implies desperation. A blind ambition where your goals are suspect and you\u2019re more than willing to make questionable decisions to achieve them.\n\nI see. Can you provide an example?\n\nOf course! Let\u2019s say a high school sophomore wishes to be the starting point guard on the school\u2019s basketball team next year. If he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019s going to spend the entire summer refining his game, lifting weights and getting in better shape. If he\u2019s thirsty, however, he\u2019ll start a rumor that the kid he\u2019s competing with for that starting spot has herpes. And not just herpes herpes, but a rare herpes that can only be contracted through basketball contact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirsty niggas invent diseases?\n\nAnd spread unsubstantiated rumors. Shit, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the bubonic plague was caused by a crew of really thirsty sewer rats pissed that the house rats were getting all the cheese.\n\nIs thirst just based on ambition-based actions?\n\nNo. Thirst levels can also be based on why you have a particular ambition. Using the high school basketball player again, if he\u2019s hungry, he wants that starting spot to prove that he deserves it and to be able to compete on the highest levels. Perhaps he even wants to earn a basketball scholarship. If he\u2019s thirsty, he just wants to be a starter to increase his pool for potential prom dates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it possible to be hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nDefinitely! For instance, no one would deny that Drake has an impeccable work ethic. Especially back when he was releasing new mixtapes every few months. He was hungry to establish himself as, well, who he is today. But his actual content, while good (mostly), has always been thirsty.\n\nI mean, how many songs can one person write about \u201cAmber\u201d from \u201cSilver Spring\u201d who \u201cworked at Cheesecake Factory\u201d and \u201chooked you up with extra jalape\u00f1o poppers\u201d and how you always wished you could \u201cescape the world together\u201d but you\u2019re \u201ctoo infatuated with Houston strippers\u201d but still wish, sometimes, that you were \u201cnormal\u201d so you could have your \u201cCheesecake Factory romance\u201d in peace?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake is so thirsty, I\u2019m shocked his tonsils aren\u2019t sandpaper. Someone get that nigga an Aquafina!\n\nAnyone else hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nMiley Cyrus, whose career seems to be a perpetual vacillation between extreme hunger and extreme thirst.

It\u2019s the second time this has happened in the past two years. The first time, it was under very different circumstances; to be honest, being let go from a gig that caused me very real emotional and mental stress was kind of a relief. This time, after a day of moping, I could only ask: \u201cOK, Universe, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nStill, everyone wants to be in control of their destiny. No matter what the reason, it can be a real blow to be told that your boss is eliminating your position\u2014or worse, just handed a pink slip with no conversation whatsoever; just an end date and a smile. But Beyonce gave us the blueprint for how to make lemonade out of lemons, and while losing your full-time gig is never easy\u2014believe me, I\u2019m living it\u2014here are five action steps to take after being let go:\n\n\n\nFeel What You\u2019re Feeling\n\nListen y\u2019all, when you get called into your boss\u2019 office for that conversation about your position ending, there are a bunch of feelings that come with it. Even if you\u2019d already been planning to leave, you may feel demeaned, embarrassed, sad, angry, and maybe even a bit relieved.\n\nGetting fired is difficult because everyone wants to leave a situation on their own terms. Keep this in mind, though: You get to be in your feelings for as long as you need to. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you to \u2018suck it up\u2019 or push you to smile when you simply don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s healthy to feel pain and sadness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly\u2014especially in those first few days after receiving the news\u2014avoid destructive urges to either ignore your feelings or numb them. The worst thing you can do when you\u2019re devastated is attempt to eat, drink, smoke, or screw away your feelings. Feel your feelings and work through them. Sit with them. As they say, there\u2019s no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone. You need to be healthy for that next step.\n\nPull Your Community Close\n\nHopefully, you have a squad that loves you and wants to see you win. So when you get that pink slip, pull your community in close. When I learned that my contract was not renewed, the first thing I did was tell my squad. And if you have a crew like mine, then you have at least one of each of these three types onboard: an Olivia Pope-style strategist, a Cleo-type ride-or-die, and your very own Molly, who is your day-one shoulder to cry on\u2014and all of them are your biggest cheerleaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour strategist will help you reach your best self. She\u2019ll devise a 10-point strategy for your next step. She\u2019s the one who might even have a short-term hook up to give you a little cushion between now and your next full-time gig\u2014your real glow up.\n\nYour ride-or-die? She\u2019ll amp you up with fantasies of slashing tires and breaking out windows. Her purpose is to remind you of how great you are. If you\u2019re angry, then she\u2019s angry. And while she may have a drink with you or smoke with you, she won\u2019t let you wallow, \u2018cause you\u2019re her girl and ain\u2019t nobody gonna keep you down for long.\n\nYour day-one shoulder to cry on is the sista that will love on you, no matter what. Hugs, tears on her shoulder, and plenty of \u201cI love you, sis, you got this\u201d are always at the ready. Emotion is her middle name, and you can express all of yours with her. She\u2019ll also gently nudge you to take a walk while talking and encourage you to see your therapist because she knows you need a little push to get you back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while your friends are always there for you, keep in mind that they need a break now and then, too. When that happens, let the professionals take over: Seek out a bodyworker, yoga class, Reiki specialist, or acupuncturist to do some healing outside of your friend circle. You deserve it.\n\nRevisit Your Exit Plan (or Start One)\n\nI\u2019ve written about exit plans before, but have since learned firsthand that sometimes a pink slip will interrupt even the best exit strategy. Don\u2019t throw your exit plan away, though; instead, update and retool it (your squad will come in handy here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you have two weeks or 90 days left on your contract, but no matter the length of time you still need to think about your next step. What thrills you? What have you always wanted to do, but were too afraid to go after it? Explore those new options.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started an exit plan, this is a perfect time! You\u2019re leaving anyway, so think big! Since we all have bills, you might have to find a temporary gig to get you to your next great thing, and that\u2019s where gathering your contacts becomes critical!\n\nGather Your Contacts\n\nUnless you\u2019re the type of person that\u2019s trampled over everyone in your wake and burned every bridge, there\u2019s a solid possibility that colleagues in your field have heard of you, your good work, and want to support your success. Let your contacts know you\u2019re looking and that you\u2019d love their help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn is a good spot to do this via direct message, but if you know them well, talk to them face-to-face over coffee or tea. Be open to new opportunities that may come your way. Your contacts may need your skillsets in a way you never envisioned. If you have a specific path in mind, make sure you pull those contacts first. You may not get a new job right away, but plant those seeds, and they\u2019ll grow.\n\nExit With Dignity\n\nWe all have those fantasies of destroying expensive computers, slapping your cube-mate who clipped their fingernails at their desk, and cursing out the boss as you walk away like Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale, throwing a match behind you. And yes, you and your ride-or-die may have joked over brown liquor about really putting a hurting on someone, but no. Stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of leaving after getting the pink slip is doing so with your dignity intact. Yes, that flip-out scene from Jerry McGuire is appealing, but ain\u2019t nobody got time for that, and gossip spreads quickly. The best thing to do in the time you have left is to shore up your projects and move on. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re better than this gig. Don\u2019t beg your supervisor for another chance or to reverse the decision\u2014and definitely don\u2019t badmouth your coworkers. Keep it cool. Do your job and keep it pushing. Also, you should start to think about what you\u2019ll say in your next interview. Be honest, but also reflect on what you learned from the experience. Thank your boss for the opportunity, ask for feedback (if you feel up to it), and pack your stuff.\n\nI\u2019ve been fired twice in my life. This second time, I already had an exit strategy. Still, there\u2019s nothing like wanting to leave on your own terms. As I reflect on my next steps, the emotion that I have to tackle is fear. Fear of going backward, fear of failure, fear of regret. Job security is real. And we all got bills to pay. But safety isn\u2019t part of my exit strategy, and it shouldn\u2019t be part of yours, either. When the universe opens a door, we just need to walk right on through it. And y\u2019all, I\u2019m running through mine!", "keywords": ["exit", "strategy", "youre", "let", "thing", "fired", "youve", "need", "job", "slip", "dont", "feelings", "real"], "polarity": 0.1328659534909535, "subjectivity": 0.44230755355755347},

I was the first child of my African immigrant parents to take ballet and gymnastic classes. I was their first Girl Scout, first overpriced prom experience and first recipient of their Parent Plus college loan. Together, we navigated mainstream America while eating Ghanaian food at home.\n\n\n\nI was confident in my cultural identity, but juxtaposed with my black American peers and white counterparts, whose customs were different from my own, my acquiescence into self-actualization at times was challenged. My coming-of age years were as diverse as a piping-hot pot of jollof rice.\n\nMy quaint family attended Ghanaian traditional baptisms and funerals adorned in kente cloth and other garb normalizing African culture in my New England neighborhood. Mom wrapped her hair in a duku head scarf similar to Ramonda in Black Panther. My cousins and I wore bright Ankara-print fabrics like Okoye, Nakia and Shuri as we served food and drinks at Ghanaian social events. My dad and uncles donned Entumas like Zuri, although they weren\u2019t used as protective shields, as they were for Black Panther\u2019s warriors. Our African attire wasn\u2019t a costume. My parents brought Ghana to small-town America.\n\nThree weeks into the Marvel movie\u2019s debut, filmgoers across the country have been flooding social media with pictures of themselves in African garb. Men, women and children across the Diaspora feel connected to the \u201cAfricanness\u201d of Black Panther, and it\u2019s a beautiful, melanin-filled sight to see.\n\nThe film connects black Americans to a continent that has ben positioned as mysterious, disease-infested and dark to the Western world. Moreover, most African Americans are descendants of the slave trade, whose African heritage, customs and religion were deliberately erased and replaced with a European system created by colonizers. Watching the two worlds marry in Hollywood matrimony is prime black pride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of Black Panther and African pride, I\u2019d like my fellow blacks across the country to keep Africa closer to their hearts, like the way my parents kept Ghana close to our souls. How can we further connect to Africa beyond aesthetics? How can we sustain this feeling of Afrocentric bliss, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t become a fad?\n\nI spoke with Linda Heywood, a professor of African-American studies and history at Boston University, and Gina Paige, president and co-founder of African Ancestry, for historical context and action steps that African Americans can take toward living their best Wakanda lives from the inside out.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nThe Root: Is this moment of African Americans connecting to Africa sustainable?\n\nPhoto: Boston University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Heywood: There always this need for more Africa, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Martin Luther King, and ... then you have the 1957 Ghana independence; that was the first step. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Africa kind of went underground in a certain way because the image we were seeing of Africa [was] so negative. So it\u2019s like this is a reawakening of the connection to Africa. I think that\u2019s excellent, but we need to sustain it.\n\nGina Paige: The entire community has benefited from the impact of Black Panther promoting pride in being of African descent. As more people want to celebrate their Africanness, they naturally want to find their own \u201cWakanda.\u201d We have seen an increased interest in people wanting to know which African country and tribe or ethnic group they share ancestry with.\n\nTR: How does finding your ancestry help with connecting to the continent?\n\nLH: There\u2019s a deep family connection [in finding your DNA]. People need to know they are connected to something. If you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the descendant of slaves,\u201d then you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not connected to anything,\u201d because slavery was a temporary status that went on far too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGP: African Americans want to connect with Africa because our histories were stolen from us through bondage. As a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, we lost our names, our languages, the freedom to honor our ancestors, and our families were sold apart. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t have any of those things. We don\u2019t know where we are from, and we cannot use genealogy records to find out. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t know where you are from.\n\nTR: How can we expect to feel knowing our biological background?\n\nLH: Why should we be always connected to slavery? We have to make our own interpretation. Don\u2019t let people put on us that status. Connecting to Africa is one way, but it\u2019s not the way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: African Ancestry\n\nGP: People feel all sorts of emotions upon receiving their results. They are overwhelmed, happy, surprised, proud, excited, curious and more. They immediately want to learn about the people and countries and share the information with their family members.\n\nTR: How can children learn more about Africa?\n\nLH: Not many students are learning about Africa. We have to get in those images. Not just for Black History Month. Not just Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Junior high schoolers need to be brought into Africa in more realistic ways so that we have not just creative stories, but bring in the stories of real people who had to make real decisions and make choices. Rulers, whether they are female or male, have to make choices, and we have those elements for Europe. Let us have more for Africa. Teachers have to be able to put that into the curriculum.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Where can the average adult start learning about the history of Africa?\n\nLH: Start by reading biographies. Be realistic in how you look at your African past history, your heroes and heroines. For men, there\u2019s Shaka Zulu (South Africa), Mansa Musa (West African Mali empire) and Asantehene (Ghana). For women, there\u2019s Nana Yaa Asantewaa (Ghana), Queen Amina (Nigeria), Queen Njinga (Angola).\n\nGP: Ethnic groups are extremely important to knowing who we are because they are the social factors that dictate culture. The top five tribes for African Americans are Fulani, Mende, Balanta, Yoruba and Tikar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Beyond history, how else can we live our best Wakanda life in America?\n\nLH: We have to travel outside of the United States: Senegal, Ghana, Angola, Zambia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zanzibar. There are lots of sites in Africa. This is where the deep history is.\n\nGP: Take an African Ancestry test, travel, research; reading, listening to music; meet people from Africa who live in the United States; attend festivals; watch documentaries and films produced in African countries. The truth is that we are already connected in ways that we don\u2019t even realize.", "keywords": ["know", "black", "history", "panther", "connected", "african", "embracing", "ghana", "dont", "real", "africa", "roots", "americans", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.1466350316350316, "subjectivity": 0.38116321178821166},

This means that whenever we go ANYWHERE, I have to have a few things on deck: diapers, wipes, a first-aid kit of some sort, snacks, and water or juice. You can get away with water for a while, but once your little ones taste that sweet nectar of concentrate, all you\u2019ll hear from then on is, \u201cI WAN\u2019 JUICE!\u201d Parenting, man. It\u2019s the business.\n\n\n\nNow, I have a fairly boss diaper bag that has all the pockets and several compartments in odd places that aren\u2019t handy until they\u2019re super handy. Mommy, though? Mommy throws stuff in her purse. It\u2019s why she gets very nice but big-as-hell tote purses. They can fit everything! I\u2019m talking snack cups, diapers, juice boxes, changes of clothes, etc.\n\nMy parents can feel me on this one. Stop any parent on the street or basically anywhere\u2014church, IKEA, BBD concert, etc.\u2014and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a person stocked up like a CVS. You get so used to parenting that even when your kids AREN\u2019T with you, there are things you just have instinctually. In my bag right now, I have some Goldfish snacks and I\u2019m not sure why, but I have them, just in case. I shall eat them myself.\n\nSo it was no surprise but also a little bit awesome to see Blue Ivy munching on what looks to be fruit snacks while mom Yonc\u00e9 held on to the juice box and an extra fruit-snack pouch, just in case. Listen\u2014for those of you who are not parents yet, let me explain something to you about children under the age of, say, 8 who want shit:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey don\u2019t give a fuck about where they are or who you are or why you\u2019re there. When they want something, they want it, and they are going to let you know loudly and frequently.\n\nSome kids? They learn early on about \u201ctime and place.\u201d Other kids know that lesson, but ain\u2019t nothing worse than being hungry and bored. It\u2019s the same thing as being hangry, except when you\u2019re 6, being bored is the ultimate in, \u201cWHY IS THIS MY LIFE?!\u201d For whatever reason, snacks and juice typically shut kids up for a while as they happily munch away on whatever it is you decided to bring, from pita chips to Cheerios, temporarily satisfied with life.\n\nI imagine for a show as long as the Grammys were\u2014and good Lord, were they long\u2014that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bag was full of an assortment of amazing snack treats.

My 5-year-old nephew has apparently reached the age where bald curiosity meets peak candor, because he\u2019s taken to asking me this question every time we see each other, as we did a few days ago. My response is always the same: \u201cHoney, why do you want me to be married?\u201d\n\nMore than once he\u2019s said shyly, while hanging off my neck, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d\n\nOuch. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not alone. I have you, and your sister, and Mommy and Daddy, and Grammy and Papa ... \u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think you should get married,\u201d he earnestly insists.\n\nOK, enough philosophy; time to get real with this kid: \u201cWell, what would I need to be married?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, he always screws up his adorable little face, as if I\u2019ve asked him the meaning of life ... or whether he\u2019s brushed his teeth yet.\n\n\u201cHmm ... a husband?\u201d\n\nEnd of discussion, thank God.\n\nValentine\u2019s Day can be an embarrassment of riches rich with embarrassment for single people, whether it\u2019s a 5-year-old deeply concerned about you dying alone, or a well-meaning, happily married colleague who suggests that you do a story on the statistical undesirability of black, single women in online dating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd no matter how much one\u2019s version of alone differs from lonely, if I\u2019m honest, it always stings, at least a little.\n\nBut then I think back to last Valentine\u2019s Day, when I was a freelance creative trying to figure out my next big chess move. Only a week before, I\u2019d moved back to my hometown after a 24-year absence\u2014in part because the man I\u2019d long been dating long-distance lived there.\n\nBut instead of feeling at home, I was sad, scared, set adrift, waiting for a sign, and starting to have the growing suspicion that my \u201cboyfriend\u201d liked me much better when we weren\u2019t in the same area code. That suspicion would prove true months later, when an out-of-town friend spotted him on Tinder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, I was lonely\u2014far lonelier than I am now, when I\u2019m basically married to my job (a concept I thought a bit too advanced for my nephew). But somewhere between trying to meet a man halfway and getting The Glow Up up and running, I went missing.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether it was my constant attempts to be accommodating, the constant grind of trying to learn on my feet, or just the constant pressure to be all things all the time and never quite feeling that I was measuring up, but I allowed myself to get lost in the mix. I checked out, and I must admit, checking back in is harder than I thought.\n\nAnd I know I\u2019m not alone; every day I engage with the incredible growing community in The Glow Up Facebook group, and see myself reflected in the women there, all of us trying to stay present and connected\u2014even when we\u2019re not quite sure what to connect ourselves to anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I\u2019ve matured, I\u2019ve realized, as many of us do, that love is a choice; a choice we must make over and over again\u2014sometimes in spite of everything else. But all too often, our concept of love remains fixed to factors that we have very little choice in at all, like waiting to get \u201cchose\u201d or finding someone \u201cworthy\u201d of choosing.\n\nWhy do we do that? Is it because it\u2019s easier to throw our fates to the wind than to choose ourselves, even if no one else does?\n\nI can\u2019t currently claim loneliness; my life is too full of deadlines, and meetings, and personalities, and way too much stuff. I also don\u2019t think about marriage much these days\u2014there are lots of reasons I\u2019m not married, and some of them are entirely on me. And, thankfully, I can say without bitterness that I don\u2019t even miss my ex. When I think back on him and the men who preceded him, I feel no regret.

Rodriguez (Getty Images)\n\nWhen writer-director Jordan Peele won his Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 2017\u2019s biggest hit, Get Out, I cheered. When cast members of 2018\u2019s biggest hit so far, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, walked the red carpet at the 90th Academy Awards, I swooned. And when I looked out at the sea of (mostly) white people attending the Oscars, I wondered, \u201cDid Hollywood learn anything over the past year?\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a budget of less than $5 million, Get Out made $255 million at the U.S. box office last year. Girls Trip, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, made more than $140 million in 2017. Black Panther is on pace to do $1 billion worth of business worldwide, reaching $900 million over this past weekend. Movie-theater owners know what\u2019s up: Films that are more diverse put up numbers. But does Hollywood know that?\n\nIn a show of amazing discipline, no one of note (so far) has written a story lately expressing shock that black movies are having a moment. Because, technically, this \u201cmoment\u201d has been a known thing since the \u201990s (Wesley Snipes\u2019 vehicle Blade made $415 million in 1998). Or at least since Tyler Perry took his chitlin circuit plays and made Madea mainstream with 2005\u2019s Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If a movie is good, or at least steeped in our cultures and traditions, someone will happily plunk down more than $10 to see the flick. And studies show that films with diverse casts make more money.\n\nBut you can know all of this, make all the money, get all the accolades and still have a career that never quite hits the stratosphere after an Academy Award, thanks to good ol\u2019 prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalle Berry is a bona fide star with an Oscar for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, and the most interesting thing I\u2019ve seen her in of late is a fitness-themed, quasi \u201cthirst trap\u201d photo on Instagram. Mo\u2019Nique has been pretty vocal about her post-Oscar life. And while Taraji P. Henson was happy to be nominated for an Oscar in 2009, she struggled to get work until Empire came along.\n\nI know how Hollywood works for white people, particularly white men. You get a real hit that makes real money and win some awards, and you get a blank check to do, create, write, produce or direct almost anything you want almost in perpetuity, even when you struggle to make another hit.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t expect director Ryan Coogler to win an Academy Award for Black Panther next year, but\u2014according to \u201cYou just made almost a billion dollars\u201d rules\u2014I do expect someone to whip out a blank check and tell him to go create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Hollywood is supposed to work. Just as I expect all of Jordan Peele\u2019s film dreams to come true post-Get Out\u2019s success and his Oscar win Sunday night. Just as I expect Ava DuVernay to have a long and storied career post the Oscar-nominated Selma (and her new Disney film, A Wrinkle in Time).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to see is some Langston Hughes, \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d mess where everyone\u2019s potential dries up like a raisin in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be successful in film and television. Take it from someone with a failed TV show (or two) under her belt. But in a world where white men can fail upward until they succeed, black men and women who create, and are successful at creating, deserve the same opportunities, funding and support that, say, Zack Snyder or Michael Bay receive, despite the fact that they ruin most things they touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, successful black creators deserve even more, since they have a proven record of success. But until the best of us are treated as well by Hollywood as the worst of them, Hollywood won\u2019t have learned this lesson: Diversity sells. Black movies and their success aren\u2019t flukes. And talent is talent, and you should reward it. Nurture it. Take risks for it.\n\nEspecially when that talent just won an Oscar or raked in a billion dollars.", "keywords": ["white", "know", "talent", "nah", "hollywood", "finally", "black", "win", "oscar", "successful", "lesson", "learn", "expect", "million"], "polarity": 0.15548086498790728, "subjectivity": 0.4440389813629249},

In between shooting takes for the now classic Thanksgiving-dinner scene, Eddie Murphy and cast trade jokes about what would happen if Mr. and Mrs. Jackson (John Witherspoon and BeBe Drake) had sex in the bathroom of his character Marcus\u2019s luxurious New York City condo.\n\n\n\nDirector Reginald Hudlin wraps shooting for the week, but he cannot shake the thought: \u201cWhat would happen if the Jacksons had sex in the bathroom?\u201d He imagines all the ways it could be shot, how to make the joke land without being crass, how to use the moment to poke fun at respectability politics and buppydom. He rushes to set the following Monday to find that Murphy has been having the same thoughts. They improv the scene on camera dozens of times, each time funnier than the one before. It\u2019s this black creative synergy that makes Boomerang the FUBU of romantic comedies.\n\nThis summer, Boomerang turns 25. To celebrate, The Root spoke with Hudlin about the film that made every black person in America dream of moving to New York City to work for an all-black company.\n\n\u201cThat period in which Boomerang was made was a period of unapologetic blackness,\u201d Hudlin told The Root. \u201cA black upscale romantic comedy was something that audiences really wanted to see, that they needed to see.\u201d\n\nBoomerang centers on Marcus Graham, an ad executive at Lady Eloise, an all-black cosmetics company. The self-proclaimed \u201cEleganza mack daddy of the month\u201d has a thing for beautiful women with pretty feet\u2014and for mock turtlenecks (I counted 10). Marcus\u2019 life is upended when his new boss, the suave Jacqueline (Robin Givens), flips the supposed gender script and beats the player at his own game. The wounded lothario finds comfort in the arms of Angela (Halle Berry), the pretty, boho-lite art director with a not-so-secret crush on Marcus. After a dramatic breakup\u2014\u00e0 la \u201clove shoulda brought your ass home last night\u201d\u2014Marcus and Angela reconcile and stroll off together into the Lower East Side sunset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe love triangle involving Jacqueline, Marcus and Angela is actually the least interesting aspect of the movie.\n\nViewers are seduced by the sumptuously black world of the Lady Eloise company and its employees. In their world, life moves to the rhythm of a banging R&B soundtrack. Everyone is fresh dipped in cashmere overcoats, silk blouses and haute couture tuxes as they partake of martini lunches and attend black-tie launch parties. Sexual romps are as commonplace as first-class business trips to New Orleans and the Caribbean. And didn\u2019t we all want to have an uppity auntie who lived on an estate named Lavender Hill?\n\nWhite critics panned Boomerang, saying that it was unrealistic in its portrayal of black life on celluloid. Some went so far as calling the film \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cfantasy,\u201d saying that companies like Lady Eloise didn\u2019t exist. In other words, how dare Hudlin and Murphy create a film where everyone from the mailroom workers to the CEO was black and about that corporate life?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHudlin knew that black audiences of various socioeconomic statuses would relate to the film.\n\n\u201c[Boomerang is] a film that rings true to people,\u201d Hudlin says. \u201cAnyone who knows Johnson Publishing or Burrell advertising or Motown Records or BET or Radio One\u2014there\u2019s any number of black media businesses where black folks work and live our lives.\u201d\n\nHe was right.\n\nEvery black person who had been raised on a steady diet of Ebony magazine went to the theater opening weekend to consume all of the film\u2019s brown-sugary deliciousness. We made Boomerang a box-office smash. It grossed $70 million domestically and $131 million worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurphy made a string of films in the late 1980s and early \u201990s that, like Boomerang, presented fully imagined black universes. We wanted to visit Coming to America\u2019s (1988) pastel-painted land of Zamunda. Fans have re-created Zamunda in music videos, step shows and birthday bashes. Harlem Nights (1989) made us nostalgic for the 1930s, when black hustlers wore suits \u201ctailor-made to fit\u201d and ran the dopest night spots in all of New York City. These films share a theme: black people in control of our own communities. We triumph over the insidiousness of white supremacy, and black love\u2014romantic and familial\u2014wins.\n\nWe needed to see that then. We still do.\n\nThis is why we keep rewatching Boomerang\u2014reciting the lines verbatim\u2014every time it airs on BET, and why it remains one of the top-grossing black romantic comedies of all time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReflecting on Boomerang\u2019s legacy, Hudlin, whose political thriller Marshall hits theaters this October, says: \u201cI remember talking with Eddie Murphy about [Boomerang] years later. And he said, \u2018Reggie, I\u2019ve gotten compliments from Lena Horne and Ice Cube about it.\u2019 That\u2019s all of black America right there\u2014from Lena Horne to Ice Cube.\u201d\n\nTanisha C.

There\u2019s never really any in between. But there is a very palpable significance in remembering, reliving and recognizing black history and respecting how far we\u2019ve come (even though 2017 mirrors the past more times than we\u2019re comfortable with).\n\nI guess that\u2019s what is so important: the mirroring of our past, reflected in our present, to keep us woke. That\u2019s what makes some (read: people suffering through white guilt) either squirm in their seats when watching this type of \u201centertainment\u201d or avoid it at all costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root 100 honoree Dee Rees wrote the screenplay to Mudbound with Virgil Williams, based on the book by Hillary Jordan. One of my favorite parts of Rees\u2019 version of Mudbound is how she relies on the characters\u2019 narration of their plights to carry the story along. It\u2019s as if their inner thoughts pull you in and make you a part of their world. You hear Mary J. Blige\u2019s character, Florence Jackson, speak of her son, Ronsel, whom you watch go off to fight on the front lines of World War II, and she says, \u201cI held his heartbeat in my hands\u2014\u201d Immediately you realize that you\u2019re in for something deeper than you may be ready for.\n\nWhen you think of the word \u201cmud,\u201d you\u2019re immediately surrounded by stiff, thick, filthy earth you want to stay away from. But that wasn\u2019t the case for the farmers and sharecroppers in rural Mississippi. They were surrounded by, steeped in and almost defined by the mud\u2014hence: Mudbound.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Blige) are tenant farmers in Mississippi, and the land they work is purchased by a white man, Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke). This is a man who hardly has any common sense, no real business sense and an icebox where his heart used to be. He pulls his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), and their two daughters wherever he sees fit to move them, hoping for golden opportunities to keep his family well within their privilege. And that privilege is apparent, even though the McAllans are forced to slum it with the \u201cNegroes\u201d who work the farm.\n\nThe Jacksons represent the black family who try against all odds to make their way out of the expected. Both Hap and Florence work tirelessly to make sure their children are clothed and fed and still have the capacity to dream farther than the mud in front of them. It just hurts watching and knowing that black poverty is worlds apart from white poverty.\n\nEven when Henry moves his privileged family onto the farm, he is still above all the people who have broken their backs for that land. He and his family are allowed to walk into stores through the front door, drive miles around the farm in their cars and demand that someone else help them with their children, even though Henry\u2019s wife, Laura, is a stay-at-home mom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHap and Florence\u2019s oldest son, Ronsel, returns from war and befriends Henry\u2019s veteran brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), and that friendship continues the exposure to the narrative of inequality that frustrates you throughout the film. As a soldier, Ronsel saw the world outside of America and experienced a freedom that the land of the free couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t offer up to him. It has made returning home bittersweet; he is tortured in his longing to be treated like a human being and finds camaraderie in Jamie.\n\n\n\nJamie acts as a conscience against racism. Naturally, a white savior shows up in these narratives, and I think it helps to ease white guilt, but the way Rees and Williams wrote the Jamie character shows the complicated reality of how a man is raised one way, experiences the world and then tries against all that surrounds him to show up differently than he\u2019s been taught.\n\n\n\nBut Jamie\u2019s character isn\u2019t perfect. He suffers through post-traumatic stress disorder and uses alcohol as a coping mechanism. His father, Pappy (Jonathan Banks), is the most racist villain in the movie and antagonizes everyone who isn\u2019t him\u2014even his own sons. At one point, Hap tells his son (who had to apologize for putting Pappy in his place): \u201cNo use in fighting. They just gonna win every time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat line socked me right in my ribs! And so did this movie. While each actor gave a performance that is easily Oscar-worthy, the women of the film stuck with me. Watching Blige\u2019s character, Florence, leave her own children to attend to Laura McAllan\u2019s, and take on her husband\u2019s job when he was injured, left my face stained with tears. The experience of black women having to take nanny jobs and neglect their own children is common throughout history and even now. And somehow, those black\u2019s women\u2019s children still have to push through life without having their mothers there to help guide and rear them.\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t there a proverb that says black women get shit done? Florence proves this. There\u2019s no job too big or too belittling for her. Everything she does is for the elevation of her family. In the 1940s, it was common for men to be the head of the household, and there was no questioning or alternatives. This is a very apparent theme in Mudbound, but it is also obvious that if the man is the head, the woman is the neck.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlorence and Laura show how women of those times stayed silent but also had a magical quality in allowing the man to think he\u2019s making decisions, when it\u2019s really the woman\u2019s plan all along. In The Root\u2019s interview with Blige and Mulligan, they share what it took to play these seemingly meek but obviously strong female characters:\n\nThe beauty of Mudbound is that it\u2019s on Netflix (premiering Nov. 17), so you can watch at your own pace. I walked out of the controversial movie Detroit because of the repetitive torture inflicted on black bodies, but I stayed in my seat for Mudbound because Dee Rees offered something that Kathryn Bigelow couldn\u2019t: heart and storylines.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there is lynching. Yes, the word \u201cnigger\u201d will ring in your ears. Yes, there are members of the Ku Klux Klan in this film. But there\u2019s also a story of resilience, the strength of fighting for a country that doesn\u2019t even want you in it, the stability of an unbreakable family structure and a bird\u2019s-eye view of how racism is bigger than all of us. Well done, Dee Rees.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "man", "family", "inequality", "black", "exhausting", "executed", "america", "florence", "rees", "mudbound", "properly", "racism", "world", "women", "tale", "children"], "polarity": 0.06688253968253968, "subjectivity": 0.4630613756613757},

It\u2019s the second time this has happened in the past two years. The first time, it was under very different circumstances; to be honest, being let go from a gig that caused me very real emotional and mental stress was kind of a relief. This time, after a day of moping, I could only ask: \u201cOK, Universe, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nStill, everyone wants to be in control of their destiny. No matter what the reason, it can be a real blow to be told that your boss is eliminating your position\u2014or worse, just handed a pink slip with no conversation whatsoever; just an end date and a smile. But Beyonce gave us the blueprint for how to make lemonade out of lemons, and while losing your full-time gig is never easy\u2014believe me, I\u2019m living it\u2014here are five action steps to take after being let go:\n\n\n\nFeel What You\u2019re Feeling\n\nListen y\u2019all, when you get called into your boss\u2019 office for that conversation about your position ending, there are a bunch of feelings that come with it. Even if you\u2019d already been planning to leave, you may feel demeaned, embarrassed, sad, angry, and maybe even a bit relieved.\n\nGetting fired is difficult because everyone wants to leave a situation on their own terms. Keep this in mind, though: You get to be in your feelings for as long as you need to. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you to \u2018suck it up\u2019 or push you to smile when you simply don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s healthy to feel pain and sadness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly\u2014especially in those first few days after receiving the news\u2014avoid destructive urges to either ignore your feelings or numb them. The worst thing you can do when you\u2019re devastated is attempt to eat, drink, smoke, or screw away your feelings. Feel your feelings and work through them. Sit with them. As they say, there\u2019s no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone. You need to be healthy for that next step.\n\nPull Your Community Close\n\nHopefully, you have a squad that loves you and wants to see you win. So when you get that pink slip, pull your community in close. When I learned that my contract was not renewed, the first thing I did was tell my squad. And if you have a crew like mine, then you have at least one of each of these three types onboard: an Olivia Pope-style strategist, a Cleo-type ride-or-die, and your very own Molly, who is your day-one shoulder to cry on\u2014and all of them are your biggest cheerleaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour strategist will help you reach your best self. She\u2019ll devise a 10-point strategy for your next step. She\u2019s the one who might even have a short-term hook up to give you a little cushion between now and your next full-time gig\u2014your real glow up.\n\nYour ride-or-die? She\u2019ll amp you up with fantasies of slashing tires and breaking out windows. Her purpose is to remind you of how great you are. If you\u2019re angry, then she\u2019s angry. And while she may have a drink with you or smoke with you, she won\u2019t let you wallow, \u2018cause you\u2019re her girl and ain\u2019t nobody gonna keep you down for long.\n\nYour day-one shoulder to cry on is the sista that will love on you, no matter what. Hugs, tears on her shoulder, and plenty of \u201cI love you, sis, you got this\u201d are always at the ready. Emotion is her middle name, and you can express all of yours with her. She\u2019ll also gently nudge you to take a walk while talking and encourage you to see your therapist because she knows you need a little push to get you back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while your friends are always there for you, keep in mind that they need a break now and then, too. When that happens, let the professionals take over: Seek out a bodyworker, yoga class, Reiki specialist, or acupuncturist to do some healing outside of your friend circle. You deserve it.\n\nRevisit Your Exit Plan (or Start One)\n\nI\u2019ve written about exit plans before, but have since learned firsthand that sometimes a pink slip will interrupt even the best exit strategy. Don\u2019t throw your exit plan away, though; instead, update and retool it (your squad will come in handy here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you have two weeks or 90 days left on your contract, but no matter the length of time you still need to think about your next step. What thrills you? What have you always wanted to do, but were too afraid to go after it? Explore those new options.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started an exit plan, this is a perfect time! You\u2019re leaving anyway, so think big! Since we all have bills, you might have to find a temporary gig to get you to your next great thing, and that\u2019s where gathering your contacts becomes critical!\n\nGather Your Contacts\n\nUnless you\u2019re the type of person that\u2019s trampled over everyone in your wake and burned every bridge, there\u2019s a solid possibility that colleagues in your field have heard of you, your good work, and want to support your success. Let your contacts know you\u2019re looking and that you\u2019d love their help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn is a good spot to do this via direct message, but if you know them well, talk to them face-to-face over coffee or tea. Be open to new opportunities that may come your way. Your contacts may need your skillsets in a way you never envisioned. If you have a specific path in mind, make sure you pull those contacts first. You may not get a new job right away, but plant those seeds, and they\u2019ll grow.\n\nExit With Dignity\n\nWe all have those fantasies of destroying expensive computers, slapping your cube-mate who clipped their fingernails at their desk, and cursing out the boss as you walk away like Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale, throwing a match behind you. And yes, you and your ride-or-die may have joked over brown liquor about really putting a hurting on someone, but no. Stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of leaving after getting the pink slip is doing so with your dignity intact. Yes, that flip-out scene from Jerry McGuire is appealing, but ain\u2019t nobody got time for that, and gossip spreads quickly. The best thing to do in the time you have left is to shore up your projects and move on. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re better than this gig. Don\u2019t beg your supervisor for another chance or to reverse the decision\u2014and definitely don\u2019t badmouth your coworkers. Keep it cool. Do your job and keep it pushing. Also, you should start to think about what you\u2019ll say in your next interview. Be honest, but also reflect on what you learned from the experience. Thank your boss for the opportunity, ask for feedback (if you feel up to it), and pack your stuff.\n\nI\u2019ve been fired twice in my life. This second time, I already had an exit strategy. Still, there\u2019s nothing like wanting to leave on your own terms. As I reflect on my next steps, the emotion that I have to tackle is fear. Fear of going backward, fear of failure, fear of regret. Job security is real. And we all got bills to pay. But safety isn\u2019t part of my exit strategy, and it shouldn\u2019t be part of yours, either.

I told myself it was because I needed to concentrate on writing, and social media provided too many opportunities to distract and distance myself from the work. I\u2019m compulsive and obsessive by nature, so once I\u2019m into something, it takes a lot of work not to immerse myself completely. It also takes an all-or-nothing cold turkey approach to quitting whatever random, relatively harmless thing onto which my addictive personality has latched.\n\nAlthough it was easy to get rid of Facebook and Twitter, I\u2019m not made of stone, so I\u2019m still on Instagram. Comparatively, it doesn\u2019t take a massive amount of time or require much interaction, and I don\u2019t fall easily into black holes.\n\nI know many studies say that Instagram photos trigger depression because of the envy caused by staged photos. But I never understood that because the photos clearly look staged. I mean, who is in the room taking photos of couples cuddling on the couch? I\u2019ve made plenty of smoothie bowls, and it is impossible for them to be pretty.\n\nI have no desire to do any of those things, so seeing perfectly staged photos does nothing but make me want to know how long it took to stage them. The only problem with Instagram is that damn explorer page ... you watch one video clip of white children dancing to \u201cFinesse\u201d and next thing you know, IG is convinced that all you ever want to see is white folks doing well-choreographed, yet somehow still spastic, dance routines.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not completely wrong because\u2014what?\n\nBeing off Twitter specifically has been a blessing. Over the last year, the constant influx of political news and random outrage had me in a constant state of anxiety. The anxiety was so prevalent that I didn\u2019t notice I was constantly trembling with nerves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last three months, I have avoided being inundated with tweets by Toupee Fiasco and then the hurricane of responses and analysis of his tweets or actions. The need to know something as soon as it happens has lessened. I assume that if we are in a nuclear war, someone will tell me or text me or post a selfie on Instagram with an inspirational caption and fitting hashtag.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no real reason for me to watch every single false alarm and frenzy.\n\nWhat I also appreciate is the conversations I have with friends about current events. I\u2019m not completely out of the room, but I have a moment to process information and remember nuance before firing off a 140-character (wait; it\u2019s like 400 characters now, right?) half-formed thought. I can really sit with and develop an opinion without the hurried, pressurized \u201cTell me what you think about this RIGHT NOW.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt helps me avoid stating how I\u2019m supposed to feel based on the opinions around me and instead gives me a chance to actually process nuance and context before I decide what I think. I also get the benefit of hearing other opinions and voices and weigh them against my own. I\u2019m not as prone to performative outrage as I was.\n\nIt\u2019s only been a few months, and the change in my process has been significant.\n\nThis was driven home the day of the Las Vegas terror attack. I was at the library all day, so I didn\u2019t even know it had occurred until around 8 p.m. that evening. By then, the bodies had been counted and the major questions had been answered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t have to watch the body count grow as bodies were collected. I didn\u2019t have to watch the shell-shocked survivors being forced by greedy newspeople to recount their traumas. Or read endless Twitter discussions and \u201chot takes\u201d from people whose ill-informed opinions take on a 30-tweet thread that may or may not even be relevant.\n\nI found out what happened, sent love to those affected and said a prayer for something to be done to stop the sale of automatic weapons.\n\nI do kind of miss Facebook because sometimes I just want to talk about my day or make an observation, but I\u2019ve learned that instead of putting it in a status message, I should put it in a Word document and see if it turns into a story for the book or an essay for something else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing off Facebook does make me miss all the birthdays and life events. I\u2019m constantly sending \u201cbelated\u201d greetings for birthdays, book deals and babies. But aside from that, I can pretty much do without Facebook, too.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve recommended unplugging and stepping back in this space before, but that was more or less a suggestion to log off and spend a few hours away. Actually deactivating was a load off my shoulders that had been there for so long and weighed so heavily on me that I was numb to it.\n\nI appreciate and often miss the variety of discourse offered by social media, but I don\u2019t miss the constant influx of not just opinions but also the level of toxicity and outrage that is just too much for me these days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will have to eventually return to it, but for now, controlling, not only the flow of information, but giving myself space from attempting to make sense of it or sharing my thoughts immediately, has been helpful; I think (hope) that how I use social media will change when I do.\n\nI hope I retain the same amount of thoughtfulness and introspection without falling into the typing-fast-and-saying-nothing way I\u2019d used it before.", "keywords": ["know", "miss", "watch", "selfcare", "im", "social", "act", "photos", "media", "twitter", "opinions", "instagram", "breaking", "facebook", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.059037558685445995, "subjectivity": 0.48025653923541267},

And I don\u2019t say that lightly. There\u2019s just a lot of cool costumes and a lot of cool clothing. Lando\u2019s clothing, that\u2019s what I like. I was secretly super happy. His clothing is another spice of life. He takes pride in the clothing. It makes things easier. When people see you and you\u2019re debonair, they tend to want to give you stuff easier. [Laughs] Yeah, people are like, oh, this guy\u2019s got it together. He\u2019s obviously not starving, you know. He has enough leisure time to choose a nice outfit.\n\nGlover also talks about opportunities to be found in playing Lando as a younger man:\n\nI always like seeing younger characters when they are in younger times because it tells a lot about how they got to where they are. Like, when I was a teenager I felt like I knew a lot, but I didn\u2019t. By the time we meet him in Empire Strikes Back, he owns the city already. [Laughs] So, I wanted to show the person he was before that was even possible. Like, I don\u2019t even know if he thought that was possible at the time.\n\nThere\u2019s more fun details in the interview so head on over to EW to read the whole thing.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite? Seeing Janet Mock, Patrisse Kahn-Cullors and Tarana Burke in the spotlight among an array of activists featured in Common and Andra Day\u2019s performance of their nominated song, \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d from Marshall.\n\nBut this is The Glow Up, so aside from waiting to see if our faves would win, we fixed our collective gaze on the red carpet.

In an otherwise overly long ceremony, it certainly gave us something to look forward to. So, without further ado, here\u2019s how we showed up and out Sunday night:\n\nJanet Mock gave us old Hollywood glamour in this white gown. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Common keeps his cool.

One of the best parts of Oscar night is the \u00fcber-exclusive annual Vanity Fair after-party, and our folks were out in force, giving us a bonus round of big fashion moments (minus one blue vest that felt a bit out of place amid all that glamour\u2014#SorryNotSorry).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was truly a night full of stars\u2014and they were outspoken and in full effect.

From Blue Ivy letting us know she runs the Knowles-Carter household, to everyone with white roses in support of Time\u2019s Up, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s American satire and Kesha\u2019s powerful Time\u2019s Up-esque performance (featuring Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day and more), taking a stand has become an important thread in the makeup of an artist. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d said Janelle Mon\u00e1e, carrying the torch for equality for women with her Grammys appearance.\n\nMon\u00e1e shook the table with her speech:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry\u2014artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: #TimesUp. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammy nominees Logic and Khalid, alongside Grammy winner Alessia Cara, performed their powerful nominated song, \u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d The song, about suicide, was a shift not only in the culture but also in the room, with the performers bringing a group of suicide survivors and family members of suicide victims onstage with them. Logic ended the performance with a stance on immigration policy, saying, \u201cBring us your tired, your poor and any immigrant who seeks refuge.\u201d\n\nTo say there were important moments at the Grammys this year is to make an understatement. Check out some of the best moments from the 2018 Grammys:\n\n\n\nKendrick Opens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Grammys opened in a big way with Kendrick Lamar giving us a powerful political performance complete with American flags and marching soldiers. With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

Ever since I first saw Menace II Society in 1993 and Chauncey called Kane a \u201ccockblockin\u2019 motherfucker\u201d, I knew there was something special about him. Roughly an almost literal hundred thousand trillion roles later, I\u2019m still rockin\u2019 with him. When I fire up Netflix, sometimes I search for his name just so I can add each movie to the queue. Because I\u2019m going to watch it. Because Clifton Powell is good all the time, and all the time Clifton Powell is good. I don\u2019t know how or why he decided to become one of the greatest role players in Black American history, Blacking up the screen in new and innovative ways each time our, but it is an achievement for which he does not get enough credit.\n\nUntil today.\n\nShould I ever get a budget big enough to do this, I will personally fund, construct, and smile to the high heavens as Clifton Powell cuts the ribbon on the Clifton Powell Hall of Fame for Role Players in the Realm of Black Excellence at Cinematic Arts. Clifton Powell is deserving. He plays roles that I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d want to see until he\u2019s in there. He is in movies that I do not know exist until I search his name. Then do you know what I do? I watch those movies. Who Made The Potato Salad? He was there. A Weekend with The Family? He was there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n99 North? Yep. Note to Self? There too. The Marriage Chronicles? The Preacher\u2019s Son? The Undershepherd? The Gospel? Yep. Word. Sho you right. You betta know that. He was there. If there\u2019s a Black movie that didn\u2019t quite hit the mainstream in the past 20+ years, there\u2019s a really, really good chance that Clifton Powell the Great is there, moving along the story, being stoic, Blackin', ushering in the talents of those around him in order to deliver the best movie possible with whatever material is present. Are all of his movies good? Absolutely not. But will I watch them anyway? Of course I will. Any actor who has put in so much work in so many different ways, all for the art of Black Excellence deserves a few hours of my time. Clifton Powell is an inspiration.\n\nHe is also not alone. There are a lot of actors and actresses who have contributed to Black Excellence in their roles as role players, ensuring that we can heal the world, make it a better place, for you and for me and the entire human race. They make Black movies of varying quality, but the truth is, whether a bad Black movie or a not bad one, they are I and I are them, sometimes conflicted, sometimes with lines, but always with Black in my heart. I\u2019m pretty sure that was the original new tag line for TVOne but they somehow ended up at Represent even though the 90s called and want their style back. I'm guessing they asked Ja Rule for advice.\n\nWho are these other purveyors of Black Excellence? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 8 inductess into the CPHOFfRPitRoBEaCA, which certain needs to be a thing. Also, I have no idea how to shorten that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Jason Weaver\n\nNobody has had as storied career as Jason Weaver. Hook Singer. Verse singer. Album dropper. TV Actor. Movie Actor. Dancer. Gold Teeth Savant. Animated Film Singer. If it needs doing, Jason Weaver can do it. He\u2019s been Michael Jackson AND Simba, easily two of the most iconic Black people to have ever lived. He\u2019s been in Chingy videos with Keisha Knight-Pulliam. Where has he ain\u2019t been? Know what I\u2019m sayin? He shows up in the most random of movies but the key words there are that he shows up. Jason Weaver, I salute you. From bigger films like ATL and Drumline to lesser films like He\u2019s Mine, Not Yours and Note to Self, Jason Weaver, you keep on keepin\u2019 on.\n\n2. Tatyana Ali\n\nAshley Banks brought you the original acclaim. Little did we know that it wasn\u2019t that you couldn\u2019t stop, it\u2019s that you wouldn\u2019t stop. From roles on the small screen to the big (ish) screen, and starring in meta-ass roles in both Brother and The Brothers, AND dropping an album as well, Tatyana Ali does it like she\u2019s doing it for TV because she still is and always will be. Take that. Take that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Rick Gonzalez\n\nUnless you pay attention, you might not know the name immediately. And that\u2019s a shame. He was playing basketball then quitting then gangbanging then playing again and taking errant three pointers in Coach Carter (who saved his life), he was a founding member of the Biker Boyz in the movie of the same name, he was in November Rule, a c-level Black movie where he sold shoes, and don\u2019t even get me started on Deuces where he used all of the skills from every movie he\u2019s been in to come up with his character\u2019s (Papers) ethos. Perhaps he\u2019s always the bridesmaid, but he\u2019s getting all the free drinks because he\u2019s always on your screen somewhere. Plus he was in Roll Bounce, easily one of the best movies to ever come out ever.\n\n4. Monica Calhoun\n\nShe might always be Ebony from The Player\u2019s Club to you, but she managed to find her a man in Lance in the Best Man though she bought the farm in the sequel. She\u2019s been around in c-level movies and major TV shows, and Love & Basketball ruining Monica\u2019s relationship though I guess she only went to Burger King. She\u2019s put in the time. She got her spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Meagan Good\n\nThis woman needs no introduction, but I\u2019ll say this and keep it short and sweet, she played the shit out of the role in Waist Deep, which was no easy feat because this movie also stars Game as a dude named Big Meat, which, yeah. Then again all she had to do was be fine. Meagan Good has been around as long as most of us have playing the second banana but excelling at it and making EVERYBODY look good in the process.\n\n6. Wendy Raquel Robinson\n\nDo you know why she\u2019s a first ballot HOFer? Because of her role as Piggy aka Principal Regina Greer, love foil to Mr. Steve Hightower aka Steve Harvey. She single-handedly made it believable that it was possible for him to be a love interest. No work she did as Tasha Mack comes close to being as \u201cactish\u201d as that role. Wendy, you are a true American hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Christian Keyes\n\nChristian Keyes is a difficult one to nail down. He\u2019s out here creating his own movies, and trying to put positive imagery out there. But he\u2019s also never going to rise to the level that I\u2019m sure he believes he should be at. Then again, maybe he\u2019s exactly where he wants to be, happily in control of his career. Whatever the case may be, Christian Keyes is somebody who is another must watch for me on the Black movie circuit. If he\u2019s in the movie I\u2019m watching it. And he\u2019s usually the guy with a good heart who\u2019s still a nigga so he\u2019s definitely banging your daughter, but ultimately he only wants to do what\u2019s right and love everybody. And even though the majority of his movies have titles that sound like plays that Tyler Perry rejected, they all seem to bring me joy. Christian Keyes is doing what Shemar Moore wanted to do only folks gave Shemar more shots because he was prettier. Yet, I never look for Shemar Moore credits. Only Christian Keyes. Salute.\n\n8. Jazsmin Lewis\n\nWhile she is not Mike Jones, you might be asking yourself, who? This woman has 64 acting credits on IMDB, three which include Barbershop where she played Calvin\u2019s wife. But she brings so much more to the table. She shows up in movies that you don\u2019t see coming, often times with other inductees into the HOF. Her work in I Do\u2026I Did and Traci Townsend is legendary. It\u2019s not legendary.", "keywords": ["know", "hes", "players", "im", "movie", "black", "realm", "role", "hall", "excellence", "fame", "cinematic", "movies", "clifton", "good", "powell"], "polarity": 0.18534620672415944, "subjectivity": 0.4974448648464397},

During that season in New York City, every charity group, institution, media company and rando (including The Root) throws a ball, gala or fancy party of some kind. Our own shindig, The Root 100, goes down Nov. 9.\n\nSo October, for me, has been filled with parties both small\u2014like Facebook Marketplace\u2019s Halloween-themed soiree at Gary\u2019s Loft downtown\u2014and gigantic, like the Harlem School of the Arts Masquerade Ball, held at the legendary Plaza Hotel, which honored R&B great Mary J. Blige.\n\nFor weeks now, I\u2019ve been running this party circuit, making a point not to turn down anything I get invited to, and needless to say, by the time I got to Jezebel\u2019s 10th-anniversary party at the Well in Brooklyn, I was pretty out of it. It didn\u2019t help that I was just fresh from yet another gala, the \u201cBuilding Academic Excellence in the Bronx and Stamford\u201d benefit for Excellence Community Schools, and just wanted to sleep. But I stayed there an hour anyway, enjoying a random Zazie Beetz-getting-her-life-on sighting and wondering what my life had become as I was out after work hitting the party scene for the fifth night in a row.\n\nShort version: Welcome to Antisocial, the society-and-events column for people who are terrified of both. I look so terrible, guys. So bad that I don\u2019t have bags under my eyes\u2014I have luggage. Like, the big kind made out of hard plastic, with an extended handle and wheels. I\u2019m just dragging my saggy eyes behind me, as if we\u2019re in the airport heading for a red-eye. Thank goodness for the rainy weekend, when I was able to do some catch-up and rest-up; otherwise I have no clue how I\u2019d get through this week, which is full of ... you guessed it ... even more things to do.\n\nThe 23rd Annual Black Tie & Sneakers Gala Benefiting the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best thing about the Black Tie & Sneakers Gala (aka \u201cthe SportsBall\u201d) is that it benefits a worthy cause, the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health, which does everything for the health and wellness of people\u2014particularly people of color. One standout program includes an HIV/AIDS-awareness campaign through which barbers and stylists are trained to talk to their clients about sexual health.\n\n\n\nThe second-best thing is that you get free sneakers with your swag bag.\n\nThis year they were Adidas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking place Oct. 18 at the Grand Hyatt in New York City, this year\u2019s benefit honored award-winning journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien, with whom I have the oddest history. Years ago she mentioned me by my blog name\u2014the Black Snob\u2014in a book once that misconstrued something I actually wrote in defense of her. It was awkward.\n\nIt got brought up on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources, of all things. I was mortified. Not mortified enough not to go to the SportsBall and have a great time and get me some Adidas, but several years back, sure! Mortified! When you\u2019ve been in the blog game as long as I have, you\u2019re bound to have irritated someone, at least once or several times, and I used to be pretty brutal with the whole blog thing. Savage, even.\n\n\n\nThese days, though ... well, I still have the potential to be savage, but I\u2019m more behind the scenes than actively in anyone\u2019s face. Much like how I was at the SportsBall: just kind of chilling, grateful that I gave up on wearing heels to galas so that I can actually enjoy all the standing around and noshing while chatting. Sure, a jazzy flat is not as fun as a dramatic heel, but when you have feet as flat as mine, a jazzy flat will do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNY1 news anchor Cheryl Wills and NBC 4 New York\u2019s David Ushery hosted the gala, which also honored Dr. Robert Gore of SUNY Downstate Department of Emergency Medicine; Dr. Mary Bassett, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; and Kathy Hirata Chin, senior counsel at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.\n\nNaturally Curly Presents The Curl Revolution\n\nThe day after the SportsBall, on Oct. 19, I dragged myself away from an after-work goodbye gathering to head to the Lightbox in midtown for Naturally Curly\u2019s book-launch party featuring founder Michelle Breyer and her new book, The Curl Revolution: Inspiring Stories and Practical Advice From the NaturallyCurly Community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere I met writer, podcaster and model Nikia Phoenix, aka \u201c100 Percent Nicole\u201d from those cool 23andMe ads. I was shocked, SHOCKED to learn that Nikia and her friend were longtime fans of ye olde Black Snob, something I haven\u2019t worked on in years now, since I started with The Root. I\u2019m always happy and humble to meet anyone who remembers me from my years of struggle, blogging about politics and popular culture for a small but dedicated audience.\n\nThe Harlem School of the Arts Masquerade Ball\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue fact. If DJ D-Nice is spinning, I want to go there. And so I did on Oct. 23: He was performing at the after-party for the Harlem School of the Arts Masquerade Ball at the Plaza Hotel.\n\nThe benefit was for the school\u2014operating out of the Herb Alpert Center\u2014which teaches dance, music, theater, and art and design to children as young as 2 and up to age 18. Many of those who currently work with the school are former students themselves, since the institution has been around since 1964, enriching the lives of economically and ethnically diverse children in New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of those students performed and took pictures at the gala, which also honored none other than R&B songstress Mary J. Blige.\n\n\n\nBecause I\u2019m slowly (but surely) learning how not to burn myself out, I actually went home to rest up and change in between hitting the red carpet and going to the gala\u2019s after-party, which was incredibly lit. I went with my friend, the legendary jill-of-all-trades Sophia Chang, who essentially burned a hole in the floor dancing. When not dancing, she chatted up fellow legend MC Lyte, who was also there holding it down near D-Nice while he did the do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree things kept me from having a meltdown even though it was so late in the evening:\n\nI was there with a friend and ran into another friend (also a legend: New York City society columnist Audrey Bernard\u2014I felt blessed to be among so many legends), so I didn\u2019t have to wander around aimlessly trying to interrupt conversations and get to know a lot of strangers. Which is both good and bad: I literally met no one new at this party because I was so into either dancing with or talking to my friends.\n\nI was wearing a jazzy flat, so my horrible flat feet didn\u2019t give me the business.\n\nI drank a lot of Mo\u00ebt. Not enough that it was a problem, but just enough that I was mellow despite LOUD MUSIC and LIGHTS, all of which sometimes give me problems because of my very random sensory/light-noise-sensitivity issues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI only temporarily blanked out once, and it wasn\u2019t noticeable. (I think. I hope. I pray.)\n\n2 Dope Queens Taping for HBO in Brooklyn\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan\u2019t say much about this one because HBO will kill me, but 2 Dope Queens podcasters Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson (who used to write about hair for The Root) hosted a delightfully kick-ass comedy show at the Kings Theatre Oct. 23-25 in Brooklyn that I can\u2019t tell you anything about because it was a taping for a series of specials that will air on HBO next year. I can tell you that it was A) lit, B) existed and C) took place so late at night, I kept falling asleep because I am old.\n\n\n\nAlso, when the show let out, Lyft was straight up charging $130 to get back to Manhattan, which made me question all of my life choices. Still, it was worth it! I just sat around for 30 minutes outside, including until they turned out the lights at the Kings Theatre, until the price went down.\n\nWibbitz\u2019s Roaring 20s Bash\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s a Wibbitz? I\u2019m going to be honest\u2014I had not a clue. And when I RSVP\u2019d for this shindig, I was totally RSVP\u2019ing to be RSVP\u2019ing and intended not to show up, but FOMO got the best of me, so I threw on a dress and ... you guessed it ... a jazzy flat (one of these days I\u2019m going to shock you and wear a heel so you can read 800 words of bitching about the invention of heels) and went anyway for Wibbitz\u2019s Roaring Twenties Bash on Oct. 25 at the Flatiron Room in New York City. Wibbitz, a video-creation platform, was not celebrating just to be celebrating, but was celebrating another 20 other than the 1920s: $20 million in Series C investment funding.\n\n\n\nAt the Wibbitz party were 101 people in media whom I did not know, which was great because I was forced to engage. They also tossed all of our name tags on a few tables, and it was impossible\u2014for me, at least\u2014to find my name, causing most of us to have some kind of chat about how we could or could not find our name. Great icebreaker.\n\n\u201cBuilding Academic Excellence in the Bronx and Stamford\u201d Benefit for Excellence Community Schools\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Marvet Britto of the Britto Agency extended an invite to the Excellence Community Schools\u2019 benefit gala Oct. 26 at the Mandarin Oriental (of which she was an event co-chair), I took it because it was Marvet Britto.\n\n\n\nI came to love and respect Marvet, whom I first met in 2012, when I was head writer of the Prince of West Memphis\u2019 (aka T.J. Holmes) old talk show on BET, Don\u2019t Sleep. She was representing T.J. and was his staunchest defender and advocate amid the constant changes that plagued our show. We\u2019ve stayed in touch since I moved back to New York in 2016.\n\nT.J.\u2014whom I used to jokingly stalk on my old blog\u2014is now with ABC News on Good Morning America. I hadn\u2019t seen him in person in years\u2014or spoken to him, besides the occasional email here and there, since 2013. So I was happy to see T.J. frickin\u2019 Holmes (frickin\u2019 because there were children present) at Marvet\u2019s table Thursday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso there was my buddy Sophia Chang, who has known Marvet for so long, they were calling each other nicknames; and Love & Hip Hop\u2019s Yandy Smith (rocking a white fur stole). I also got to meet MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, a Bronx guy who was being honored at the event, and ran into the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was scanning the room looking for someone who was decidedly not me, but I ran up any ol\u2019 way to say hey.\n\nJezebel 10\n\nThe same night as the Excellence Community Schools gala was a big party for our fellow Gizmodo Media Group site Jezebel, which was celebrating its 10th anniversary. This is where I saw Zasie Beetz rocking out to the beat; drank a cocktail called \u201cthe DivaCup,\u201d which was Campari and Champagne; and ate \u201cJ\u201d-branded cupcake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI showed up so late to the party at the Well in Brooklyn\u201411 p.m.\u2014that it was already winding down when I got there. Food\u2014which was allegedly delicious\u2014was scarce by the time I got there, and I missed meeting Jez\u2019s new editor-in-chief, Koa Beck. (But we\u2019ll be working out of the same office soon, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see her around.)\n\nI meant to mingle at Jez 10 but ended up just talking to my fellow Danielle\u2014my producer at The Root, Danielle Young\u2014and one of my video editors, Ashley Velez, about the upcoming The Root 100 event in New York City. Going to a celebratory work event and so ... many ... galas only reminded me that I had yet to reach the finish line with my own. Would we make it? Would it be grand? Would people have a good time? And who would show up?\n\nI commented that I was sure I was going to go bald this year because much of the burden of making this event pop is on myself and two others, unlike last year, when I had my publisher, Donna Byrd\u2014a seasoned veteran of literally every The Root 100 gala\u2014doing the heavy lifting. The training wheels are off, and now we must throw an epic party that fits our crunk-party reputation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope it\u2019s as good as the Harlem School of the Arts gala.

It\u2019s the second time this has happened in the past two years. The first time, it was under very different circumstances; to be honest, being let go from a gig that caused me very real emotional and mental stress was kind of a relief. This time, after a day of moping, I could only ask: \u201cOK, Universe, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nStill, everyone wants to be in control of their destiny. No matter what the reason, it can be a real blow to be told that your boss is eliminating your position\u2014or worse, just handed a pink slip with no conversation whatsoever; just an end date and a smile. But Beyonce gave us the blueprint for how to make lemonade out of lemons, and while losing your full-time gig is never easy\u2014believe me, I\u2019m living it\u2014here are five action steps to take after being let go:\n\n\n\nFeel What You\u2019re Feeling\n\nListen y\u2019all, when you get called into your boss\u2019 office for that conversation about your position ending, there are a bunch of feelings that come with it. Even if you\u2019d already been planning to leave, you may feel demeaned, embarrassed, sad, angry, and maybe even a bit relieved.\n\nGetting fired is difficult because everyone wants to leave a situation on their own terms. Keep this in mind, though: You get to be in your feelings for as long as you need to. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you to \u2018suck it up\u2019 or push you to smile when you simply don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s healthy to feel pain and sadness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly\u2014especially in those first few days after receiving the news\u2014avoid destructive urges to either ignore your feelings or numb them. The worst thing you can do when you\u2019re devastated is attempt to eat, drink, smoke, or screw away your feelings. Feel your feelings and work through them. Sit with them. As they say, there\u2019s no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone. You need to be healthy for that next step.\n\nPull Your Community Close\n\nHopefully, you have a squad that loves you and wants to see you win. So when you get that pink slip, pull your community in close. When I learned that my contract was not renewed, the first thing I did was tell my squad. And if you have a crew like mine, then you have at least one of each of these three types onboard: an Olivia Pope-style strategist, a Cleo-type ride-or-die, and your very own Molly, who is your day-one shoulder to cry on\u2014and all of them are your biggest cheerleaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour strategist will help you reach your best self. She\u2019ll devise a 10-point strategy for your next step. She\u2019s the one who might even have a short-term hook up to give you a little cushion between now and your next full-time gig\u2014your real glow up.\n\nYour ride-or-die? She\u2019ll amp you up with fantasies of slashing tires and breaking out windows. Her purpose is to remind you of how great you are. If you\u2019re angry, then she\u2019s angry. And while she may have a drink with you or smoke with you, she won\u2019t let you wallow, \u2018cause you\u2019re her girl and ain\u2019t nobody gonna keep you down for long.\n\nYour day-one shoulder to cry on is the sista that will love on you, no matter what. Hugs, tears on her shoulder, and plenty of \u201cI love you, sis, you got this\u201d are always at the ready. Emotion is her middle name, and you can express all of yours with her. She\u2019ll also gently nudge you to take a walk while talking and encourage you to see your therapist because she knows you need a little push to get you back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while your friends are always there for you, keep in mind that they need a break now and then, too. When that happens, let the professionals take over: Seek out a bodyworker, yoga class, Reiki specialist, or acupuncturist to do some healing outside of your friend circle. You deserve it.\n\nRevisit Your Exit Plan (or Start One)\n\nI\u2019ve written about exit plans before, but have since learned firsthand that sometimes a pink slip will interrupt even the best exit strategy. Don\u2019t throw your exit plan away, though; instead, update and retool it (your squad will come in handy here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you have two weeks or 90 days left on your contract, but no matter the length of time you still need to think about your next step. What thrills you? What have you always wanted to do, but were too afraid to go after it? Explore those new options.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started an exit plan, this is a perfect time! You\u2019re leaving anyway, so think big! Since we all have bills, you might have to find a temporary gig to get you to your next great thing, and that\u2019s where gathering your contacts becomes critical!\n\nGather Your Contacts\n\nUnless you\u2019re the type of person that\u2019s trampled over everyone in your wake and burned every bridge, there\u2019s a solid possibility that colleagues in your field have heard of you, your good work, and want to support your success. Let your contacts know you\u2019re looking and that you\u2019d love their help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn is a good spot to do this via direct message, but if you know them well, talk to them face-to-face over coffee or tea. Be open to new opportunities that may come your way. Your contacts may need your skillsets in a way you never envisioned. If you have a specific path in mind, make sure you pull those contacts first. You may not get a new job right away, but plant those seeds, and they\u2019ll grow.\n\nExit With Dignity\n\nWe all have those fantasies of destroying expensive computers, slapping your cube-mate who clipped their fingernails at their desk, and cursing out the boss as you walk away like Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale, throwing a match behind you. And yes, you and your ride-or-die may have joked over brown liquor about really putting a hurting on someone, but no. Stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of leaving after getting the pink slip is doing so with your dignity intact. Yes, that flip-out scene from Jerry McGuire is appealing, but ain\u2019t nobody got time for that, and gossip spreads quickly. The best thing to do in the time you have left is to shore up your projects and move on. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re better than this gig. Don\u2019t beg your supervisor for another chance or to reverse the decision\u2014and definitely don\u2019t badmouth your coworkers. Keep it cool. Do your job and keep it pushing. Also, you should start to think about what you\u2019ll say in your next interview. Be honest, but also reflect on what you learned from the experience. Thank your boss for the opportunity, ask for feedback (if you feel up to it), and pack your stuff.\n\nI\u2019ve been fired twice in my life. This second time, I already had an exit strategy. Still, there\u2019s nothing like wanting to leave on your own terms. As I reflect on my next steps, the emotion that I have to tackle is fear. Fear of going backward, fear of failure, fear of regret. Job security is real. And we all got bills to pay. But safety isn\u2019t part of my exit strategy, and it shouldn\u2019t be part of yours, either. When the universe opens a door, we just need to walk right on through it. And y\u2019all, I\u2019m running through mine!", "keywords": ["exit", "strategy", "youre", "let", "thing", "fired", "youve", "need", "job", "slip", "dont", "feelings", "real"], "polarity": 0.1328659534909535, "subjectivity": 0.44230755355755347},

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively.

Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA.

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed. And they\u2019ll probably be scanning for a teacup to smack out of your hands.", "keywords": ["white", "telling", "ive", "random", "man", "airports", "person", "khalid", "black", "woman", "tell", "look", "probably"], "polarity": -0.01694444444444445, "subjectivity": 0.4044642857142857},

To care about them more than my bank account.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Gurira also spoke about understanding her increased visibility and impact on younger generations since her standout role as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther, saying:\n\nThis journey has led me many a time to the presence of young people. .... Young people who look at me to give them something to hold onto, that special nugget that just may help them get through.

To be unsure of your place in this realm, of how you will ever find it or how you will ever like yourself, let alone love yourself. ...

Hell, I, myself, lost $20 on this very discussion because of a bet that I placed where I just KNEW The Five Heartbeats lead singer was, in fact, Eddie Kane, Jr.\n\nI was, in fact, wrong. So let\u2019s set the table.\n\nKendrick Lamar - you may have heard of him - recently released his latest album, DAMN., to much fanfare and discussion on the Internets. The discussions have spread low and wide and if you\u2019re Black and listen to music, there\u2019s a better than 90 percent chance you have at some point in the past four days had a discussion about this album.\n\nOn this discussion-heavy album, there is a song called \u201cGOD.\u201d which I love. I listen to it all the time. It features many things held near and dear to Black people including the statement \u201cdon\u2019t judge me\u201d and a reference to El Debarge and his finger waves, long held to be one of the 9 wonders of the Black world. I cannot name the other 8 because that would be snitching, which is frowned upon, and that credo may or may not be a wonder of the Black world. You can see how complicated Blackness gets.\n\nIn this song - and this is NOT snitching - Kendrick drops the line, \u201cslick as El Debarge with finger waves, work it JT!\u201d which is a nod (I assume) to none other than J.T. Matthews, one of the members of The Five Heartbeats, a fictional group, long thought to be patterned after The Dells, for which a movie of the same name, The Five Heartbeats, exists. The other members of the group are Donald \u201cDuck\u201d Matthews (J.T.\u2019s brother and songwriter of the group), Terrence \u201cDresser\u201d Williams (whose real name you only find out through google because I\u2019m not sure his real name is ever said in the movie), Anthony \u201cChoir Boy\u201d Stone (whose name DOES get said in the movie), and the lead singer, the one and only, Eddie King, Jr., a man for whom the pronunciation of his name has caused actual arguments and fist fights. It\u2019s been said (though Snopes.com cannot prove it) that the first World Star fight video was between a grandmother and her 2nd cousin about whether Eddie\u2019s last name was King or Kane.\n\n\u201cWork it, JT\u201d derives from an early scene in the movie where J.T. and Duck run a scam on women that I\u2019m pretty sure does not still work today, where Duck would go over to a woman and get her number for J.T. by convincing said woman that J.T. was too shy (I\u2019m guessing that shit was cute back then) to come over himself. After a show where former lead singer (another fact verified by the interview that will be mentioned), Bobby, who lost his spot to Eddie by way of getting shot in the leg after running from a card game - we never hear from Bobby again - J.T. and Duck run the scam and then Duck asks J.T. to work the scam for him. It looks like it\u2019s going really well, hence the line, \u201cwork it J.T., work it!\u201d by Duck, only it turns out that J.T. selfishly got the chick\u2019s number for himself. But because God has a sense of humor and also doesn\u2019t like ugly, the woman whose number J.T. got was at the restaurant with a man who uttered the quotable ass quote, often heard at nightclubs and Black game nights everywhere, \u201cevery night I have to fight to prove my love\u201d as he goes off to whip J.T.\u2019s ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong explanation aside, that \u201cwork it J.T.\u201d line is one of my favorites. Always has been. Me and my boys use it all the time.\n\nI made mention of this on Facebook and one of my friends from college, and real talk I always give him credit for this, one of the reasons I ever started blogging in the first place, Calvin, jumps into the comments with this:\n\n\u201cMy favorite Five Heartbeats pet peeve/nit pick is that people refuse to call Eddie King Jr by his real name\u2026.it's not Eddie Kane or Eddie Cain or any other such variation! It's almost as bad as people saying \"who else wanna eff with Hollywood Cole\" (it's Hollywood Court)\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, too, detest that everybody refers to that Hollywood Court as Hollywood Cole, a nod to Outkast\u2019s song \u201cSpottieottiedopalicious\u201d where Dre\u2019s Atlanta accent confused way too many people, but if you aren\u2019t from Atlanta then there is literally NO reason to know about Hollywood Court, a now demolished housing project on the West side of the city in Zone 1.\n\nAn-t-way, Calvin\u2019s comment reminded me of the time that I got verification from one person who could provide such verification of what Eddie\u2019s ACTUAL last name is: Robert Townsend, the who directed The Five Heartbeats, and co-wrote it with Keenan Ivory Wayans. If anybody knows the truth, it\u2019s him. Right? Right.\n\nIt just so happens that through the power of the Internets I once got the opportunity to speak to him and ask him directly. A woman I knew through VSB and I were talking about me wanting to ask Robert Townsend himself. Turns out, she was a publicist with The Caraway Group AND doing work for her firm on another movie he directed called In The Hive. She said she\u2019d set up an interview with him if I agreed to interview him about the movie and write a piece on VSB about it. (I still have all of the emails from September 2011 to prove it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruh. Sign me up.\n\nShe set up the interview and I had the opportunity to talk to him about In The Hive. We chopped it up for about 30 minutes and toward the conclusion of the interview I told him that I had to ask him a question that was going to settle bets everywhere: in The Five Heartbeats, what is Eddie\u2019s last name?\n\nHe said, definitively, that it was King. We laughed about that and I told him that I was about to lose a bet because I swore his last name was Kane (like so many people do). We got off the phone and I never did write up that feature (my bad).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut from there, every time it comes, I make sure to reference that convo to people and make sure that I\u2019m doing my part for the culture. So if you are indeed wondering and have been calling that man Eddie Kane, Jr., since the 90s, the truth is, his real name is Eddie King, Jr.\n\nHis name is his name. Sharing is caring and the more you know\u2026ding.\n\nSo in case you ever wondered, to quote Maxwell, don\u2019t ever wonder.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["know", "jt", "heartbeats", "duck", "movie", "work", "hollywood", "kane", "heres", "yall", "jr", "king", "eddie", "real", "hey", "interview"], "polarity": 0.055871546149323936, "subjectivity": 0.4878698804624731},

But the question is, do vision boards really work? And if so, how?\n\n\n\nI began creating vision boards nearly nine years ago, and I can attest to the remarkable power they have\u2014when used properly\u2014in bringing our visions to pass. When my vision boards aren\u2019t working, I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m not spending sufficient time focusing on my visions and imprinting them into my mind. But when they do ...\n\nJust a few of the miraculous experiences I\u2019ve encountered that began as mere images on my vision board include learning to speak Italian, living in Italy, moving to paradise (Bermuda) and meditating by the sea, writing a book, starting a business, vacationing in exotic locations, delving deeper into yoga and meditation, and harnessing greater freedom, power and self-awareness (illustrated by words on my vision board).\n\n\n\nSo, what is a vision board? A vision board is a creative, visual tool that helps us clarify and concentrate on a specific goal or desire.\n\nVision boards give us clearer direction in where we want to go; and with direction, we have greater clarity regarding the actionable steps we need to take in reaching our goals. We know the things we need to say yes to, which will bring us closer to our goals, as well as the things to say no to, which pull us further away from the things we desire.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do vision boards work? According to a 2009 article in Psychology Today:\n\nBrain studies [now] reveal that thoughts produce the same mental instructions as actions. Mental imagery impacts many cognitive processes in the brain: motor control, attention, perception, planning and memory. So the brain is getting trained for actual performance during visualization. It\u2019s been found that mental practices can enhance motivation, increase confidence and self-efficacy.\n\nVisualization is a powerful exercise for the mind. As we think and create an image in our minds, we emit its frequency into the universe, which then magnetizes our vision to reality. This is the law of attraction. Our subconscious mind works to achieve the information that\u2019s stored in it. So be careful what you focus on\u2014good or bad\u2014because you may just bring it to life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a vision board can be quite entertaining. Grab a group of friends and have a vision-board soiree. Have everyone bring poster board, glue, scissors and magazines. Provide simple snacks and refreshments, candles, and some fun or calming relaxing music. Or have an intimate solo date with yourself! Let\u2019s get started:\n\nBefore cutting out images for your vision board, get crystal clear on your intentions and desires for your life in 2018. Consider a quiet meditation before starting to imagine in your mind not just the things you want to experience but, most important, the feelings you want to experience from the manifestation. The efficacy of vision boards comes from our ability to bring feeling and enthusiasm to what we want as if we have already achieved it.\n\nPaste images and words that reflect your intentions. Be as crafty and imaginative as you\u2019d like.\n\nPlace your vision board in a prominent place where you\u2019ll visit with it often. Pause and glance over your visions daily. As you do, emote the feelings your visions engender within you.\n\nMeditate and visualize. With eyes closed, bring your visions to the forefront of your mind. Hold your visions clearly in your mind, while harnessing feelings of joy and fulfillment. Consider adding a related mantra or affirmation to your visualization, e.g., \u201cI am a New York Times best-selling author,\u201d or \u201cI live in a beautiful home with mountain views.\u201d Repeat your affirmations over and over while simultaneously visualizing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope this excites you to solidify your dreams for 2018! Building dreams requires our intentional direction, vision and focus.\n\n\n\nHappy vision boarding!\n\n", "keywords": ["bring", "boarding", "set", "board", "images", "boards", "visions", "101", "mind", "intention", "things", "mental", "selflove", "vision", "goals"], "polarity": 0.20019342359767894, "subjectivity": 0.4726858248134843},

His rich legacy of entrepreneurship and possibility lives on to this day.\n\n\n\nHow appropriate, then, that his life is being memorialized in a PBS documentary, Pioneers: Reginald F. Lewis and the Making of a Billion Dollar Empire, during Black History Month. Lewis, before his untimely death in 1993 at age 50, seemingly made black history at every turn.\n\n\n\nLewis was the first African American ever to close an overseas leveraged buyout deal for $985 million. In addition to being the first black billion-dollar deal-maker, Lewis was the first African American to open a law firm on Wall Street; the first and only person to be accepted to Harvard Law School without applying; and one of the first black men in America to have a museum named after him: the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, in his native Baltimore.\n\n\n\nGeraldine Moriba, executive producer of the documentary, said that one thing that surprised her about Lewis was how so many people who didn\u2019t know him credit him with being a stark influence on their lives.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve never met him and have no direct connection to him or any of his businesses have said to me they would not have gone into business or finance or banking if they had not heard his story,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I heard that again and again and again.\u201d\n\n\n\nLewis is what we now call a \u201cserial entrepreneur\u201d who started his first business at the age of 10 (a newspaper business where he had other children working for him, AND which he sold at a profit some years later). After attending the prestigious Dunbar High School in Baltimore, where he was a star quarterback, he went on to attend an HBCU, Virginia State University, on a football scholarship.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his senior year, Lewis attended a summer program at Harvard Law funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and excelled to such an extent that at the end of the program, he was invited to attend the law school, the only person in the school\u2019s 148-year history to be admitted before applying. Within two years of graduation, he started his own law firm, focusing on corporate law, and, according to a biography on the Lewis Museum\u2019s website, \u201chelped many minority-owned businesses secure badly needed capital using Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies (venture capital firms formed by corporations or foundations, operating under the aegis of the Small Business Administration).\u201d\n\n\n\nLoida Lewis, Reginald\u2019s widow and an incredible businessperson in her own right (she took over his business a year after his death and turned it around within one year), says that this was the right time for his story to be told. \u201cIt\u2019s been many years, so anyone under 40 would not have heard of Mr. Lewis. They should know that an African American man accomplished so much. Always pushing the envelope,\u201d Loida says.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis legacy, he said it himself, was \u2018Keep going no matter what,\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cNot that he didn\u2019t have any failures; he had many failures. But he kept going.\u201d She says that after her husband left Harvard Law and joined a prestigious law firm, they told him after two years that he wasn\u2019t going to make partner. But he didn\u2019t let that stop him. He founded his own law firm and went on to make history with the deals he made, though she noted that he failed three times before his first big one\u2014but that he learned from each of those failures.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReginald Lewis\u2019 first successful deal was a $22.5 million leveraged buyout of the McCall Pattern Co., which he nursed back to health and led to the two most profitable years in the company\u2019s 113-year history. In the summer of 1987, Lewis sold McCall, making a $50 million profit.\n\n\n\nNext up was the deal that made him famous. The museum explains:\n\n\n\nIn October 1987, Reginald purchased the international division of Beatrice Foods, with holdings in 31 countries, which became known as TLC Beatrice International. At $985 million, the deal was the largest leveraged buyout at the time of overseas assets by an American company. As Chairman and CEO, he moved quickly to reposition the company, pay down the debt, and vastly increase the company\u2019s worth. By 1992, the company had sales of over $1.6 billion annually, and Reginald was sharing his time between his company\u2019s offices in New York and an office in Paris (most of the company\u2019s businesses were in Europe).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoida Lewis, who describes her late husband as \u201cvery dynamic, very intesnse, very driven, very ambitious and very hardworking,\u201d also noted that as a husband and father (they had two children together: Leslie and Christina), he was \u201cvery loving, very tender, very sensitive.\u201d She admitted that he had a legendary temper but that he always made amends if he offended.\n\n\n\nThese days, Loida spends time with her grandchildren in her lovely home on New York City\u2019s Upper East Side, which is filled with glorious art, including Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence and a Picasso, and brags about her two daughters, both of whom also went to Harvard. The oldest, Leslie Lewis, is an actor who created a play called A Miracle in Rwanda, about a woman saved from the massacre in Rwanda. Her youngest, Christina Lewis Halpern, created a nonprofit, All Star Code, that trains black and brown boys to code during the summer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo in their own way, they\u2019re continuing Mr. Lewis\u2019 legacy,\u201d says Loida, who notes that Reginald was also a great philanthropist.\n\n\n\nThe Reginald F. Lewis Foundation, founded the same year he made the TLC Beatrice deal, gave an unsolicited $1 million to Howard University. In 1992, Reginald donated $3 million to Harvard Law School\u2014the largest grant in the history of the school at the time. In gratitude, the school renamed its International Law Center the Reginald F. Lewis International Law Center.\n\nFor Moriba, Reginald Lewis\u2019 legacy was making what seemed impossible into reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think his legacy is that he opened doors and he created hope where it didn\u2019t necessarily exist,\u201d Moriba says. \u201cHe became a model of how to be successful and made it real. That\u2019s his legacy.\u201d\n\nThe film will air on the New York City tristate region\u2019s local PBS stations and premieres Friday, Feb. 16, at 8 p.m. on WLIW 21; Sunday, Feb. 18, at 7:30 p.m. on WNET 13; and Saturday, Feb. 24, at 7 p.m. on NJTV.

But just as frequently, my dreadlocks and scalp kick my ass just as hard as my fitness regimen. And when I try to recruit a new fitness buddy, I\u2019m frequently met with frustrating rejections because of worries about their tresses; whether they\u2019ve taken the chemically relaxed route to straighten their hair or are sporting their naturally kinky coils.\n\nAs a woman of color and a fitness nut, I want to eliminate some of the anxieties from your beauty regimen and incorporate great ways to get you back in the gym. If you\u2019re committed to getting fit, here are some sweat-ready hairstyles you may want to consider:\n\n\n\nBe Protective With Braids, Twists and Cornrows\n\nProtective styles such as braids and cornrows tend to be naturally low-maintenance. These styles minimize breakage from frequent styling or various heat applications, keeping your hair intact while you work it out. After kicking ass in the gym, consider unraveling your braids and sporting a twist-out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPull It Back in a Ponytail or Bun\n\nPonytails and buns are not only easy, but versatile. Pop that hair to one side for a fun \u201980s-inspired look, or go for a classic high bun for a night out on the town after releasing all of those endorphins. Or tap into old Hollywood with a playful twist, similar to this chignon on Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay With a Short Do\n\nRegardless of what hair type you have, a short cut can accentuate your natural features while maintaining your chic. If done well, shorter hairstyles require less styling time than their longer counterparts. Tap into your inner Nefertiti with a fabulous high-top, or take your cues from Halle Berry and mimic her legendary gorgeous short haircuts.\n\n\n\nHide It in a Head Wrap\n\nPlenty of women\u2014including myself\u2014have embraced wearing head wraps because of their versatility and practicality. Interestingly enough, there\u2019s an abundance of head-wrap history in African and Afro-Brazilian culture. If you\u2019re curious, check out this Nigerian Ankara head-wrap tutorial, or follow Franchesca Ramsey\u2019s one-minute video on how to rock that printed scarf that\u2019s been collecting dust for months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevote Yourself to Dreadlocks\n\nDon\u2019t chop my head off. Yes, I did say I go through issues, too, but honestly, dreadlocks are very forgiving. However, please bear in mind that they are permanent. But like some of the aforementioned styles, you can cornrow your dreadlocks into braids, throw them into a sloppy bun or keep them in place with a stylish head wrap. If you don\u2019t want to commit, consider faux locs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe Unbeweavable\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about my girls who love their sew-ins. While this is not just a tip for women who wear weaves, I heavily suggest wearing a headband or scarf to protect your edges. Wrap your hair and place a stocking cap on top before using a silk scarf or cap on top; that will allow you to protect your tresses and look presentable.\n\n\n\nBut wait: Here\u2019s a bit more info on protecting your hair while perfecting your health:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to Do When Your Workout Is Done\n\nIf you have the ability, wash your hair with a good shampoo. When my locs require TLC, I prefer natural remedies, like soaking my hair for 10 minutes in an apple-cider vinegar wash to remove impurities from my locs. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d suggest doing all of the time\u2014doing this too much can screw up your hair\u2019s pH balance.\n\nIn between washes, using a dry shampoo on your roots goes a long way toward removing dirt and residue from your hair. After your workout, spritz your scalp with coconut oil, an olive oil sheen or even tea tree oil. For those who wear locs or braids, take it a step further by using peppermint or rosemary oil to remove any musty scents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your hair or scalp is damp underneath your sew-in, blow-dry your hair on a lower setting. A moist, sweaty scalp can lead to a foul odor and retain buildup, damaging your actual hair. And applying too much heat on a regular basis will cause hair breakage.\n\n\n\nRemember to alternate your hairstyles every now and then. Some days, I allow my hair to do its own thing. Brushing or pulling your hair in the same direction can cause traction alopecia over time\u2014and nobody has time for that.\n\nI may not have all of the answers to your specific hair-care needs, but at the intersection of beauty and fitness, I hope this aids you in getting back into a regimen that you love.\n\n", "keywords": ["hair", "scalp", "reluctant", "tips", "protect", "fitness", "head", "enthusiast", "using", "tresses", "oil", "short", "styles", "scarf", "braids", "haircare"], "polarity": 0.16237208147044208, "subjectivity": 0.4462535824830907},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

It is hurtful, more so. Everyone feels anger. After the anger, it\u2019s really hurtful because he\u2019s like looking down on a whole population of people. You are so misinformed because these places have beautiful people and beautiful everything. It\u2019s just this is the leader of the free world speaking like this. But on the other side, this has been going on. This is how people talk. This is how they talk behind closed doors. It was a moment when Donald Sterling had been exposed as this racist on a private phone conversation that he was having. It\u2019s like, \u201cOK, that\u2019s one way to do it.\u201d Another way would have been to have his team and let\u2019s talk about it together and let\u2019s\u2014maybe some penalties because once you do that, all of the other closet racists just run back in the hole. You haven\u2019t fixed anything. You have sprayed perfume on the trash can. What you do, when you do that is the bugs come and you spray something and you create a superbug because you don\u2019t take care of the problem. You don\u2019t take the trash out; you keep spraying whatever over it to make it acceptable. As those things grow, you create a superbug. And then now we have Donald Trump, the superbug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then equivocated a bit, adding, \u201cDonald Trump is a human being, too. ... I\u2019m being funny; I say that, too. Somewhere along his lineage, something happened to him. Something happened to him, and he is in pain and he is expressing it this sort of way.\u201d\n\nTrump responded Sunday morning with the following: \u201cSomebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe.\n\nCNN actually fact-checked that stat, and though Trump is technically right, the black unemployment rate remains about twice the rate for white people, what CNN called an \u201cenduring feature of the American labor market.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy? Scholars attribute the disparity to a combination of factors: hiring discrimination, lower educational attainment and a higher rate of people with criminal records, who are barred from many occupations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo ain\u2019t nothing really change, but cute talking point, Donnie.\n\n\n\nJay-Z also spoke on his marriage to Beyonc\u00e9: \u201cFor us, we chose to fight for our love. For our family. To give our kids a different outcome. You see, to break that cycle for black men and women. To see a different outcome. Like you were saying, it\u2019s not this celebrity couple \u2026 we were never a \u2018celebrity couple,\u2019 we were a couple that happened to be celebrities. We are real people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe #MeToo movement: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we normalized it. The normalization of the things we have to do to survive. For women to go to work knowing that this sort of abuse was happening every day, you can look logically and say, \u2018Why would you stay there?\u2019 What is the alternative? What is the alternative? You have to survive in America. In order to survive you have to normalize it. So, this has been going on. \u2026 So for it to get uncovered and the world to correct itself, this is what has to happen.\u201d\n\nHis love for Colin Kaepernick:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd words I never thought I would hear from his hypercapitalist mouth: \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t equate to happiness.\u201d\n\nOK!

But what happens when we lose our vigor? What do we do when we can\u2019t quite find the momentum to reach our goals that we had on New Year\u2019s Day?\n\nI can tell you personally that even before the clock struck midnight on Jan. 1, life had already thrown me a personal challenge that completely zapped my zeal and potentially derailed my plans for the first quarter of the new year.\n\nYou see, the thing about planning and setting our own goals is that we have to keep in mind that in the midst of our pursuits, life still happens\u2014and not always according to our plans. So, while we may have control over the steps we take each morning, we don\u2019t have full control over how the day will turn out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how can we stay on course and motivated throughout the year?\n\n\n\nThis week I want to share with you a few strategies that can support you throughout the year, and help you reduce the number of pitfalls resulting from a lack of motivation\u2014or avoid them altogether.\n\nWhen we\u2019re initially plagued by the \u201clack of motivation\u201d bug, I think it\u2019s important to reflect inward and examine where the loss of inspiration might be coming from, especially if there hasn\u2019t been an external factor prompting our uneasiness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we touched on in last month\u2019s self-love practice, we can honor our uneasiness and give ourselves permission to feel what we feel. Yes, I\u2019m saying allow yourself\u2014for a moment\u2014to feel unmotivated. Usually I find that when I feel uninspired, life is attempting to grab my attention elsewhere and teach me something new about myself. This is when my self-love practice goes into high gear because I stop, listen and wait. Oftentimes this is enough, just waiting it out and allowing the inspiration to return to me on its own timing.\n\nBut what if you need just a little jolt to reignite your inspiration? Here are a few daily practices that typically ignite my motivation, support me, and keep me excited and ready for more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarity\n\nThe first key to staying motivated is becoming crystal clear on your vision and intention. Knowing exactly what we want leads us to the steps and choices we need in reaching them. If we\u2019re willy-nilly about our dreams and desires, focusing on and knowing our direction becomes an onerous task.\n\n\n\nDaily Meditation, Prayer and Intention-Setting\n\nBegin your day in stillness and reflection. Spend time discovering what\u2019s happening inside you each day to enhance self-awareness. Set intentions for yourself, and seal it in ink in your journal\u2014because what gets written gets done.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChoose Your Thoughts Wisely\n\nMotivation is not just a feeling. It\u2019s a feeling that results from conscious or unconscious thoughts. Motivation is often a very conscious and deliberate choice. We can use our minds constructively and consciously to create positive thoughts that lead to positive feelings and positive actions. Staying positive best sets us up for the pursuit of our own happiness.\n\nLook for Inspiration\n\nOne of the fundamental practices I use in staying motivated in my spiritual business is my constant pursuit of inspiration. Whether I\u2019m reading an inspirational book, watching videos, attending workshops, participating in online seminars or speaking to others with similar goals, I continually surround myself with people and ideas that stretch my mind and inspire me. When we keep our minds and activities fixated on our goals, it will naturally engender more motivation and enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisualize\n\nThe more focused the attention and clearer details we give to our goals, the more excited and motivated we feel. Notice that when we daydream and fantasize about our dreams, it brings warmth and smiles to our hearts. Find that place as often as possible. Visualize and speak often about your goal. See it, feel it, taste it. Close your eyes and envision your goal as vividly as possible, and consider creating a vision board.\n\nChase Your Dreams\n\nNo matter how big or small the task, choose to show up for yourself and your goals each day. Take actionable steps daily toward your goal. This might appear as sending an email, making a call, creating a to-do list or outline, etc. Thinking alone isn\u2019t enough. We cannot think our way to right action; we must act. As you accomplish smaller goals, your motivation and inspiration will grow toward reaching larger ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEstablish an Accountability Partner\n\nHaving a coach or accountability partner has been paramount in sustaining my motivation. Whether you choose to hire a professional life coach or an executive coach, seek a mentor or enlist the camaraderie and support of a friend. Have someone who holds you accountable each week or month in accomplishing your tasks.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t have to feel discouraged when we naturally feel unmotivated. We can use the moment to teach us and point us in the direction we need to go. Stay encouraged, and enjoy the ride.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWishing you success on the journey!\n\n", "keywords": ["positive", "1000", "motivated", "set", "life", "motivation", "thoughts", "inspiration", "intention", "ill", "week", "feel", "day", "selflove", "goals"], "polarity": 0.17899245430495428, "subjectivity": 0.4731054593554593},

But the question is, do vision boards really work? And if so, how?\n\n\n\nI began creating vision boards nearly nine years ago, and I can attest to the remarkable power they have\u2014when used properly\u2014in bringing our visions to pass. When my vision boards aren\u2019t working, I know it\u2019s because I\u2019m not spending sufficient time focusing on my visions and imprinting them into my mind. But when they do ...\n\nJust a few of the miraculous experiences I\u2019ve encountered that began as mere images on my vision board include learning to speak Italian, living in Italy, moving to paradise (Bermuda) and meditating by the sea, writing a book, starting a business, vacationing in exotic locations, delving deeper into yoga and meditation, and harnessing greater freedom, power and self-awareness (illustrated by words on my vision board).\n\n\n\nSo, what is a vision board? A vision board is a creative, visual tool that helps us clarify and concentrate on a specific goal or desire.\n\nVision boards give us clearer direction in where we want to go; and with direction, we have greater clarity regarding the actionable steps we need to take in reaching our goals. We know the things we need to say yes to, which will bring us closer to our goals, as well as the things to say no to, which pull us further away from the things we desire.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow do vision boards work? According to a 2009 article in Psychology Today:\n\nBrain studies [now] reveal that thoughts produce the same mental instructions as actions. Mental imagery impacts many cognitive processes in the brain: motor control, attention, perception, planning and memory. So the brain is getting trained for actual performance during visualization. It\u2019s been found that mental practices can enhance motivation, increase confidence and self-efficacy.\n\nVisualization is a powerful exercise for the mind. As we think and create an image in our minds, we emit its frequency into the universe, which then magnetizes our vision to reality. This is the law of attraction. Our subconscious mind works to achieve the information that\u2019s stored in it. So be careful what you focus on\u2014good or bad\u2014because you may just bring it to life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a vision board can be quite entertaining. Grab a group of friends and have a vision-board soiree. Have everyone bring poster board, glue, scissors and magazines. Provide simple snacks and refreshments, candles, and some fun or calming relaxing music. Or have an intimate solo date with yourself! Let\u2019s get started:\n\nBefore cutting out images for your vision board, get crystal clear on your intentions and desires for your life in 2018. Consider a quiet meditation before starting to imagine in your mind not just the things you want to experience but, most important, the feelings you want to experience from the manifestation. The efficacy of vision boards comes from our ability to bring feeling and enthusiasm to what we want as if we have already achieved it.\n\nPaste images and words that reflect your intentions. Be as crafty and imaginative as you\u2019d like.\n\nPlace your vision board in a prominent place where you\u2019ll visit with it often. Pause and glance over your visions daily. As you do, emote the feelings your visions engender within you.\n\nMeditate and visualize. With eyes closed, bring your visions to the forefront of your mind. Hold your visions clearly in your mind, while harnessing feelings of joy and fulfillment. Consider adding a related mantra or affirmation to your visualization, e.g., \u201cI am a New York Times best-selling author,\u201d or \u201cI live in a beautiful home with mountain views.\u201d Repeat your affirmations over and over while simultaneously visualizing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope this excites you to solidify your dreams for 2018! Building dreams requires our intentional direction, vision and focus.\n\n\n\nHappy vision boarding!\n\n", "keywords": ["bring", "boarding", "set", "board", "images", "boards", "visions", "101", "mind", "intention", "things", "mental", "selflove", "vision", "goals"], "polarity": 0.20019342359767894, "subjectivity": 0.4726858248134843},

Then there will be the artistic achievements, you know,films about basically nothing but either took a long time to make or have unconventional direction.\n\nAs we move into this season, I thought it wise to look back at films that many black folks love and explain why they either should not be considered a black film or why they ain\u2019t worth a damn.\n\nLook, just because a film is watchable doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good and there are a number of beloved black movies that are valorized just because they star black actors. I call these the \u2018Halle Berry (HB) Awards\u2019 in honor of the preeminent overrated black actress who won an Oscar for being a mediocre white man\u2019s jump off.\n\nHB #1: The Wiz\n\nThis movie is boring and it\u2019s directed by a white dude (more on that later). Yes, there are amazing musical numbers. Yes, Michael Jackson danced and sang his ass off. Still, this hot garbage is hardly watchable. The narrative will put you to sleep faster than a Benadryl downed with a glass of red wine, and the acting is aggressively bad. Like, DMX in Belly kind of bad. Diana Ross killed the singing, though. Too bad they asked her to act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would wager that most people fast forward through the story and only watch the musical numbers and if you don\u2019t you\u2019re losing at life.\n\nHB#2: The Color Purple\n\nThis movie has great acting, great direction, and brilliant source material. My only beef is that Steven Spielberg is the director. I guess they could not find someone black to put behind the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t care how many times you quote the film or how much your big mama watched it, if someone black ain\u2019t in the directing chair, I\u2019m not considering it a great black film.\n\nHB #3: Coming to America\n\nSee HB 2. No black director. I refuse to consider it a great black film.\n\nHB #4: Hidden Colors\n\nThis is what you watch at the beginning of Hotep basic training. It purports to give insight about the lost history of black people in America, and even if I were able to turn off my philosophical mind, I\u2019d still find some of the information difficult to believe. Further, the director is a noted misogynist and, just being honest, the film\u2019s production values are laughable. This movie is so laced with Hotepism that I needed a bottle of lotion for my ashy ankles after watching it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHB#5: She\u2019s Gotta Have It\n\nSpike Lee\u2019s first film is aiight. He tries to elevate the material by shooting it in black and white, but the gender politics are antiquated and the acting is mediocre at best. It\u2019s Spike\u2019s first film, and I can tell.\n\nHB#6: Every single Tyler Perry film (except Daddy\u2019s Little Girls) and ESPECIALLY Temptation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not even going to dignify these films with a thoughtful analysis.\n\nHB #7: Lean On Me\n\nThis film is beloved by black grandfathers everywhere because it is a two-hour meditation on patriarchy and respectability politics. Joe Clark begins the film by expelling 300 students, and then begins to treat educators and students alike in a condescending and infantile manner. Oh yeah, a white dude directed this film as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Fair Eastside\u2019 was dope, tho.\n\nHB#8: All the sequels to Friday\n\nYou know those movies aren\u2019t funny. You ain\u2019t gotta lie to kick it.\n\nHB #9: New Jack City\n\nThis film has not aged well. The haircuts are laughably bad, the dialogue is VERY bad (Ice-T actually says, \u201cI want to shoot you so bad my dick is hard\u201d), and the acting is worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNino Brown is a cartoonish villain (Did he really put crack in the Thanksgiving turkey?) and the film does not deal with the way housing discrimination and poverty played a role in the explosion of violence in the 1990s. This film is essentially a commercial for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. I\u2019m pretty sure Hilary got the idea of Super Predators watching this movie.\n\nHB#10: Baby Boy\n\nWith the exception of Four Brothers, John Singleton has been making nonsense since 1997, and that\u2019s too bad\u2014he started with such promise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyz N The Hood is a black coming of age masterpiece; Poetic Justice is a ghettoized take on a road movie, and both Higher Learning and Rosewood are essential, tragic films. It all started going downhill when he made Baby Boy\u2014and I can see why.\n\nThis is an indulgent film. It tries to be a coming of age tale for a grown ass man, a comedy, a tense, urban drama, and a love story all at once\u2014while failing on all fronts. The direction is sloppy; the editing haphazard, and the acting is so bad that Gary Coleman would be offended. Snoop Dogg is supposed to be a threatening presence, but his arms look so emaciated in the scene with an undershirt that it made me wonder if he would have the strength necessary to pull a trigger if the narrative called for it.\n\nSingleton thinks he is insightful in the critiques of black men as careless fathers, but he merely showcases respectability politics and patriarchy in how the narrative is resolved. The film lacks the insight of Boyz in explicating how institutional racism plays a role in the failure of some black men to play an active role in the lives of their children, and, ultimately, the film calls for men to grow up and be the heads of their households without showing the barriers that could preclude such a happy ending from taking place. Essentially, according to this movie, black men need to pull up their pants, get a job, and take care of their families. But what happens if race keeps you from making a living, saving wage?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure folks will be coming for my black card or calling my place of employment demanding that I no longer teach classes on black films.

It\u2019s the second time this has happened in the past two years. The first time, it was under very different circumstances; to be honest, being let go from a gig that caused me very real emotional and mental stress was kind of a relief. This time, after a day of moping, I could only ask: \u201cOK, Universe, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nStill, everyone wants to be in control of their destiny. No matter what the reason, it can be a real blow to be told that your boss is eliminating your position\u2014or worse, just handed a pink slip with no conversation whatsoever; just an end date and a smile. But Beyonce gave us the blueprint for how to make lemonade out of lemons, and while losing your full-time gig is never easy\u2014believe me, I\u2019m living it\u2014here are five action steps to take after being let go:\n\n\n\nFeel What You\u2019re Feeling\n\nListen y\u2019all, when you get called into your boss\u2019 office for that conversation about your position ending, there are a bunch of feelings that come with it. Even if you\u2019d already been planning to leave, you may feel demeaned, embarrassed, sad, angry, and maybe even a bit relieved.\n\nGetting fired is difficult because everyone wants to leave a situation on their own terms. Keep this in mind, though: You get to be in your feelings for as long as you need to. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you to \u2018suck it up\u2019 or push you to smile when you simply don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s healthy to feel pain and sadness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly\u2014especially in those first few days after receiving the news\u2014avoid destructive urges to either ignore your feelings or numb them. The worst thing you can do when you\u2019re devastated is attempt to eat, drink, smoke, or screw away your feelings. Feel your feelings and work through them. Sit with them. As they say, there\u2019s no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone. You need to be healthy for that next step.\n\nPull Your Community Close\n\nHopefully, you have a squad that loves you and wants to see you win. So when you get that pink slip, pull your community in close. When I learned that my contract was not renewed, the first thing I did was tell my squad. And if you have a crew like mine, then you have at least one of each of these three types onboard: an Olivia Pope-style strategist, a Cleo-type ride-or-die, and your very own Molly, who is your day-one shoulder to cry on\u2014and all of them are your biggest cheerleaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour strategist will help you reach your best self. She\u2019ll devise a 10-point strategy for your next step. She\u2019s the one who might even have a short-term hook up to give you a little cushion between now and your next full-time gig\u2014your real glow up.\n\nYour ride-or-die? She\u2019ll amp you up with fantasies of slashing tires and breaking out windows. Her purpose is to remind you of how great you are. If you\u2019re angry, then she\u2019s angry. And while she may have a drink with you or smoke with you, she won\u2019t let you wallow, \u2018cause you\u2019re her girl and ain\u2019t nobody gonna keep you down for long.\n\nYour day-one shoulder to cry on is the sista that will love on you, no matter what. Hugs, tears on her shoulder, and plenty of \u201cI love you, sis, you got this\u201d are always at the ready. Emotion is her middle name, and you can express all of yours with her. She\u2019ll also gently nudge you to take a walk while talking and encourage you to see your therapist because she knows you need a little push to get you back on track.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while your friends are always there for you, keep in mind that they need a break now and then, too. When that happens, let the professionals take over: Seek out a bodyworker, yoga class, Reiki specialist, or acupuncturist to do some healing outside of your friend circle. You deserve it.\n\nRevisit Your Exit Plan (or Start One)\n\nI\u2019ve written about exit plans before, but have since learned firsthand that sometimes a pink slip will interrupt even the best exit strategy. Don\u2019t throw your exit plan away, though; instead, update and retool it (your squad will come in handy here).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you have two weeks or 90 days left on your contract, but no matter the length of time you still need to think about your next step. What thrills you? What have you always wanted to do, but were too afraid to go after it? Explore those new options.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started an exit plan, this is a perfect time! You\u2019re leaving anyway, so think big! Since we all have bills, you might have to find a temporary gig to get you to your next great thing, and that\u2019s where gathering your contacts becomes critical!\n\nGather Your Contacts\n\nUnless you\u2019re the type of person that\u2019s trampled over everyone in your wake and burned every bridge, there\u2019s a solid possibility that colleagues in your field have heard of you, your good work, and want to support your success. Let your contacts know you\u2019re looking and that you\u2019d love their help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinkedIn is a good spot to do this via direct message, but if you know them well, talk to them face-to-face over coffee or tea. Be open to new opportunities that may come your way. Your contacts may need your skillsets in a way you never envisioned. If you have a specific path in mind, make sure you pull those contacts first. You may not get a new job right away, but plant those seeds, and they\u2019ll grow.\n\nExit With Dignity\n\nWe all have those fantasies of destroying expensive computers, slapping your cube-mate who clipped their fingernails at their desk, and cursing out the boss as you walk away like Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale, throwing a match behind you. And yes, you and your ride-or-die may have joked over brown liquor about really putting a hurting on someone, but no. Stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of leaving after getting the pink slip is doing so with your dignity intact. Yes, that flip-out scene from Jerry McGuire is appealing, but ain\u2019t nobody got time for that, and gossip spreads quickly. The best thing to do in the time you have left is to shore up your projects and move on. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re better than this gig. Don\u2019t beg your supervisor for another chance or to reverse the decision\u2014and definitely don\u2019t badmouth your coworkers. Keep it cool. Do your job and keep it pushing. Also, you should start to think about what you\u2019ll say in your next interview. Be honest, but also reflect on what you learned from the experience. Thank your boss for the opportunity, ask for feedback (if you feel up to it), and pack your stuff.\n\nI\u2019ve been fired twice in my life. This second time, I already had an exit strategy. Still, there\u2019s nothing like wanting to leave on your own terms. As I reflect on my next steps, the emotion that I have to tackle is fear. Fear of going backward, fear of failure, fear of regret. Job security is real. And we all got bills to pay. But safety isn\u2019t part of my exit strategy, and it shouldn\u2019t be part of yours, either.

In her death, my greatest fear had been realized, and adjusting to that \u201cnew normal\u201d wasn\u2019t easy. My mother was my center; I\u2019d lost my center and was a complete mess.\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, I was exactly where I was supposed to be in 2016. I\u2019d placed entirely too many expectations on my healing process because I was trying to fulfill the expectations of others: Your mother raised you to be strong. She prepared you for this. You can do this. In many ways, I felt like I had to have a phenomenal 2017 to counter the horrors of 2016\u2014just to prove everyone right.\n\nThus, \u201cthe Year of the Glow Up.\u201d\n\nBut despite my best efforts, 2017 didn\u2019t glow like I thought it would. On top of still grieving Mama, my doctoral program wasn\u2019t giving me the time and support I needed to process her loss\u2014yet still demanded I meet the rigors of pursuing my degree at maximum speed. Then, while also trying to heal from a devastating heartbreak that ultimately went viral, a date friends pushed me to go on to get over my heartache ended in rape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety, I was hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric facility. Just a few months later, what a police officer referred to as a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d resulted in my being unnecessarily arrested and processed for having an expired registration on a legally registered car. If all of that wasn\u2019t enough, as I recently recuperated from surgery, a friend came to visit me on her way to celebrate the upcoming wedding of that great heartbreak\u2014a man whose bed I\u2019d just left 11 months ago and celebrated my birthday and Christmas with this time last year.\n\nAnd for 2017\u2019s final blow, four members of my family ended up in the hospital at the same time, with my aunt passing away the day after my birthday and my cousin 48 hours later. In the week before Christmas, my family attended two funerals. If 2017 was supposed to be the Year of the Glow Up, it was missing a few bulbs.\n\nA few weeks ago, one of my mentors called me simply to say, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d It took a while to believe her. I haven\u2019t always been gentle with myself these past two years. I\u2019ve made assumptions about how I should\u2019ve reacted or healed from certain traumas, and have been brutal with myself when I didn\u2019t hit those benchmarks. My mentor\u2019s words reminded me that despite it all, I\u2019m still here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are not given instructions on how to navigate life\u2019s treacherous spots, but every day that we rise to meet the sun and face a new day, we are healing and finding our way. There were days when my glow was a flame, times my fierceness was on full display, and I walked in the world with confidence. Then there were days when that glow was only a flicker, my only accomplishments taking a shower, putting on pajamas and getting right back into bed.\n\nIronically, all of that is the beauty of the \u201cglow up.\u201d Light is still light. Even in its smallest quantity, it pierces darkness. The unrealistic expectations we have of ourselves are unnecessary. All we really have to do is show up, give whatever our best is at the time, and trust that the universe will do the rest.\n\n2017 also gave me moments of deep joy in the midst of my trauma and heartache. Whether it was the Fenty Beauty launch, a cautious first date or FaceTime with my girls, I gave myself permission to get lost in laughter, love and happiness. I watched one of my closest friends take on breast cancer with her own brand of magic\u2014and win. Earlier this month, I attended a dinner for black women in digital media and was reminded that the gifts I bring into the world matter. And as we speak, I\u2019m holding my best friend\u2019s daughter, born the day before my mother\u2019s birthday, and celebrating her first Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, I didn\u2019t lack any of the things I needed to remember that life isn\u2019t over. When we are hit hard, I truly believe the universe finds ways to remind us that the pain we endure is not the sum total of who we are. We have always been so much more.\n\nIn 2017\u2019s whirlwind, seeing my therapist every week to work through these experiences and emotions has been divine. Having been in consistent therapy for over a year, I am able to gauge my growth in ways that make me proud. I trust my own voice and know what wellness and wholeness look like on me. I\u2019ve learned the necessity of being surrounded by healthy people and operating in healthy spaces. I\u2019ve learned to give people room to grow, as I haven\u2019t always been in this space of good mental and emotional health. I recognize that life is hard for all of us\u2014and instead of making it harder, we need more folk who will work to soften the land with compassion and empathy.\n\nIn declaring 2017 \u201cthe Year of the Glow Up,\u201d I set out to prove a point I never needed to make. It was perfectly fine to be undone by the tragedies of life. I am not superhuman; I am affected by what happens to me, and 2017 taught me that lesson more than any other year in my life. I had nowhere to hide and couldn\u2019t fake a glamorous glow even if I wanted. This year, my glow has been all about the truth of my experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve navigated 2017 with depths of heartache some people will never see in a lifetime. Every day, it has been too much and unfair. Yet I\u2019ve come to know grace and humility in intimate and life-sustaining ways. To be on the other side of all of it means there\u2019s a power inside me that I didn\u2019t know was there. I\u2019m grateful for that power and ready to activate it, living into all of the possibilities of my greatness. And that greatness doesn\u2019t mean 12 months of consecutive wins, but the courage to keep living when the losses inevitably come. Without question, I had a glow up this year\u2014one that, when I look back at it now, completely takes my breath away.\n\nMany of us had a hard 2017. But in just a few hours, it will be over. There will be those who tell us that just because the year changes, our circumstances will not. I hope we don\u2019t listen to them. I hope we have enough faith to believe that things can and will be different. Hard times don\u2019t last forever\u2014I\u2019m affirming that for all of us.

Inventors Ceata Lash and Joshua Esnard are both trying to take the struggle out of hair care while black: Lash\u2019s PuffCuff\u2014a hair clip specifically designed to be nondamaging to curly and textured hair\u2014helps to create and hold in place buns and ponytails or simply push hair back off of the face. Meanwhile, Esnard\u2019s creation, the Cut Buddy, provides the perfect guide for the at-home shape-up, working equally well for hairlines and beards.\n\nThese two smart inventions are riding the wave of the natural-hair movement buoyed by the flood of do-it-yourself info on social media platforms. The cultural demand for natural-hair products landed the two of them a feature on Shark Tank and verification as vendors on Amazon.com, the portal through which much of the world\u2019s retail now flows at an estimated $136 billion a year.\n\nCourtesy of ThePuffCuff.com @thecutbuddy via Instagram Courtesy of TheCutBuddy.com @thecutbuddy via Instagram 1 / 4\n\nToday, Esnard, 30, has a reported $700,000 worth of the online-sales revenue stream in partnerships with eBay and Amazon. The three-piece Cut Buddy kit retails at $14.99, yielding a hefty profit margin for its owner. Juggernauts like this are rarely seen in the personal-care arena; for Esnard, the blessing of mentorship from Shark Tank regular and serial entrepreneur Daymond John (founder of FUBU) propelled his business beyond his wildest dreams.\n\nLash founded PuffCuff in 2013 with her husband, and company CEO, Garrett Lash. Despite a three-year head start, her strong but lightweight plastic clamps, priced from $16.49 to $49, have yet to reach the same heights as the Cut Buddy. So far, the PuffCuff has a robust social media following of 66,000 and a YouTube video rapidly approaching 250,000 views, but as she shared in PuffCuff\u2019s official press release, \u201cOne of the biggest pain points about being a first-time entrepreneur is finding entrepreneurial mentors who are willing to help you without asking for money in return.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Esnard\u2019s dreams come true, he\u2019s opted to pay it forward, sharing his experience and exposure with Lash. These two entrepreneurs recently decided to buddy up and hit the refresh button to signal to the press, public and retailers that they are still growing and building\u2014and, most of all, striving for brick-and-mortar distribution.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored that Joshua has agreed to work with myself and PuffCuff,\u201d said Lash.\n\nHere at The Glow Up, we know firsthand that teamwork makes the dream work, so we\u2019re thrilled to shout out this enterprising team.

But what happens when we lose our vigor? What do we do when we can\u2019t quite find the momentum to reach our goals that we had on New Year\u2019s Day?\n\nI can tell you personally that even before the clock struck midnight on Jan. 1, life had already thrown me a personal challenge that completely zapped my zeal and potentially derailed my plans for the first quarter of the new year.\n\nYou see, the thing about planning and setting our own goals is that we have to keep in mind that in the midst of our pursuits, life still happens\u2014and not always according to our plans. So, while we may have control over the steps we take each morning, we don\u2019t have full control over how the day will turn out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how can we stay on course and motivated throughout the year?\n\n\n\nThis week I want to share with you a few strategies that can support you throughout the year, and help you reduce the number of pitfalls resulting from a lack of motivation\u2014or avoid them altogether.\n\nWhen we\u2019re initially plagued by the \u201clack of motivation\u201d bug, I think it\u2019s important to reflect inward and examine where the loss of inspiration might be coming from, especially if there hasn\u2019t been an external factor prompting our uneasiness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we touched on in last month\u2019s self-love practice, we can honor our uneasiness and give ourselves permission to feel what we feel. Yes, I\u2019m saying allow yourself\u2014for a moment\u2014to feel unmotivated. Usually I find that when I feel uninspired, life is attempting to grab my attention elsewhere and teach me something new about myself. This is when my self-love practice goes into high gear because I stop, listen and wait. Oftentimes this is enough, just waiting it out and allowing the inspiration to return to me on its own timing.\n\nBut what if you need just a little jolt to reignite your inspiration? Here are a few daily practices that typically ignite my motivation, support me, and keep me excited and ready for more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarity\n\nThe first key to staying motivated is becoming crystal clear on your vision and intention. Knowing exactly what we want leads us to the steps and choices we need in reaching them. If we\u2019re willy-nilly about our dreams and desires, focusing on and knowing our direction becomes an onerous task.\n\n\n\nDaily Meditation, Prayer and Intention-Setting\n\nBegin your day in stillness and reflection. Spend time discovering what\u2019s happening inside you each day to enhance self-awareness. Set intentions for yourself, and seal it in ink in your journal\u2014because what gets written gets done.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChoose Your Thoughts Wisely\n\nMotivation is not just a feeling. It\u2019s a feeling that results from conscious or unconscious thoughts. Motivation is often a very conscious and deliberate choice. We can use our minds constructively and consciously to create positive thoughts that lead to positive feelings and positive actions. Staying positive best sets us up for the pursuit of our own happiness.\n\nLook for Inspiration\n\nOne of the fundamental practices I use in staying motivated in my spiritual business is my constant pursuit of inspiration. Whether I\u2019m reading an inspirational book, watching videos, attending workshops, participating in online seminars or speaking to others with similar goals, I continually surround myself with people and ideas that stretch my mind and inspire me. When we keep our minds and activities fixated on our goals, it will naturally engender more motivation and enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisualize\n\nThe more focused the attention and clearer details we give to our goals, the more excited and motivated we feel. Notice that when we daydream and fantasize about our dreams, it brings warmth and smiles to our hearts. Find that place as often as possible. Visualize and speak often about your goal. See it, feel it, taste it. Close your eyes and envision your goal as vividly as possible, and consider creating a vision board.\n\nChase Your Dreams\n\nNo matter how big or small the task, choose to show up for yourself and your goals each day. Take actionable steps daily toward your goal. This might appear as sending an email, making a call, creating a to-do list or outline, etc. Thinking alone isn\u2019t enough. We cannot think our way to right action; we must act. As you accomplish smaller goals, your motivation and inspiration will grow toward reaching larger ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEstablish an Accountability Partner\n\nHaving a coach or accountability partner has been paramount in sustaining my motivation. Whether you choose to hire a professional life coach or an executive coach, seek a mentor or enlist the camaraderie and support of a friend. Have someone who holds you accountable each week or month in accomplishing your tasks.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t have to feel discouraged when we naturally feel unmotivated. We can use the moment to teach us and point us in the direction we need to go. Stay encouraged, and enjoy the ride.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWishing you success on the journey!\n\n", "keywords": ["positive", "1000", "motivated", "set", "life", "motivation", "thoughts", "inspiration", "intention", "ill", "week", "feel", "day", "selflove", "goals"], "polarity": 0.17899245430495428, "subjectivity": 0.4731054593554593},

Despite this fact, blackness has flourished. We\u2019ve seen a resurgence of pride and excitement in blackness that is reminiscent of the Black Power movement of the \u201960s. From #BlackGirlMagic to #BlackBoyJoy, Dead Mike from mythical rap group CB4 is outchea looking like a damn prophet as so many of us have woken up this year and recited his famous chorus: \u201cI\u2019m black, y\u2019all, I\u2019m black, y\u2019all, I\u2019m blacker than black, and I\u2019m black, y\u2019all!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s been blackness in 2017.\n\nYou see, it\u2019s not that black folks won\u2019t stop; it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t stop doing blackness like we\u2019re doing it for television. Over the course of 2017, circumstances have allowed for and presented themselves as ideal moments to always bet on black, per se. And collectively, we did not disappoint.\n\nHere is a list of the 10 blackest moments of 2017 (so far\u2014C.P. Time is a real thing, so we have a week left for the thunder and the rain to come down):\n\nLaVar Ball\u2019s appearance on CNN was equal parts \u201cFuck the man\u201d and \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Love him or hate him\u2014and he is easily one of the most polarizing people in America\u2014Ball basically went on television to tell the motherfucking PREZ-O-DEN \u201cFuck you and the horse Roy Moore rode in on\u201d (I\u2019m paraphrasing). And I don\u2019t care where you are or who you is; that\u2019s some black shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA film about the black experience won the Oscars\u2019 most coveted prize; and, of course, white folks tried to take it from them because that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be black in America. Moonlight was a film that spurred so many different types of conversations, from whether or not the film was any good (depends on whom you ask) to what the central theme of the movie even was (sexuality or manhood ... manhood, definitely), but when the dust settled, a movie about blackness was a central conversation piece AND the last film standing, and that\u2019s a hell of a win for African America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, 28 members of the Beta Alpha chapter of Delta Sigma Theta at FAMU decided to celebrate 10 years of sisterhood with a trip to Costa Rica. That trip resulted in a photoshoot seen round the world. Dubbed \u201cMelanin Illustrated,\u201d the women all wore similar-toned bathing suits and had all of us appreciating their beautiful blackness. I guess that\u2019s what Rotary Connection was singing about on \u201cI am the Black Gold of the Sun.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, keeping it real goes wrong, but sometimes keeping it real results in a black man using a motherfucking filing cabinet as a grill. I\u2019ve seen some black shit. Hell, I still carry around a Crown Royal bag to hold prized possessions (I really do this), but file-cabinet grilling? That\u2019s some black ingenuity on par with George Washington Carver\u2019s work with peanuts. Somebody get this man a Negritzer Prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Angela Rye responds to Omarosa Manigault being fired from her job at the White House.\n\nWords won\u2019t do this justice; you just need to watch the clip. This is master-class-level petty. This is what Merriam and Webster had in mind when they added \u201cpetty\u201d to the dictionary. Using a national stage to remind folks you have zero fucks to give? Super-Saiyan-level petty. Angela Rye, we salute you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Donald Glover thanks the Migos for making \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d as part of his Golden Globes acceptance speech for Atlanta.\n\nDonald Glover had a hell of a year. His album Awaken, My Love! (released in December 2016) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. His hit television show, Atlanta, caught the hearts and minds of black America and won Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globes in February. And what did Glover do in his thank-you speech? He thanked motherfucking Migos for making \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d because it\u2019s, like, the best song ever. Migos, who are a black-ass group even down to their familial connections as both uncles and cousins and other super-black shit, saw a huge spike in streams and sales of the single after. That\u2019s paying the blessings forward, which is a black-ass way to give back in our community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDamon Young already did a bang-up job explaining the 20 blackest moments of the Sharon Reed clapback video, so I won\u2019t reinvent the wheel. Finger pistols of death on live television. That\u2019s some black shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Issa Rae lets everyone know she\u2019s rooting for everybody black at the Emmys (2:49 mark in video).\n\nYou know how you can have some folks fucked up? You know who you NOT gon\u2019 have fucked up? Issa Rae. When asked who she was rooting for at the night\u2019s Emmys, she made it very clear that she was rooting for everybody black (probably one of THE truest statements of all time\u2014also applies to the Olympics, elections and nonblack movies with black characters), setting off a viral round of \u201cYaaaassssssssss\u201d and T-shirts and catapulting her right into position as everybody\u2019s favorite black person for a solid at-least-two weeks. Basically, she was the opposite of Omarosa. The ONLY reason this isn\u2019t No. 1 is because, well, blackness seeks its own level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2.

Listen. Sharpe said he likes to celebrate with cigars and yak and put a Black in his mouth ON TELEVISION. Even Joy Taylor knows that Black & Milds aren\u2019t real cigars. But that didn\u2019t stop Sharpe from going on about his love for Hen Dawg and Milds. That, my friends, is blackness seeking its own level. Those are the moments in blackness you don\u2019t see coming, which makes them special. Blackness is not here for you; it\u2019s here for the shenanigans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.

But men and women had very different reactions, to put it lightly.\n\nMany women applauded Jay\u2019s ability to finally take up the mantle of manhood and apologize for his bad behavior; for black women especially, there seemed to be a collective \u201cThank you!\u201d He had violated the trust of Queen Bey, and that was unacceptable. In the aftermath of the release, Candice Benbow\u2019s \u201c4:43\u201d spoke to nearly every black woman I know about what it means for men to finally reckon with honesty and faithfulness\u2014or not to\u2014at the expense of the women they claim to love.\n\nHowever, men weren\u2019t collectively as gracious, and although a 4:44 syllabus created by Anthony Boynton addressed issues of toxic masculinity and manhood, the reception from some men seemed to decry Jay as a \u201csellout\u201d to women. How dare he apologize? Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood. And when it comes to toxic masculinity and its relationship to womanhood, I\u2019m interested to see if Jay will, at some point, walk us through his understanding of the humanity of queer men as well.\n\nBut the presence of Janet Mock gives me hope. Not hope of acceptance\u2014that would just be empty rhetoric and truly a pitch to tokenism of the basest form. No, I hope that her presence is an acknowledgment of the personhood of queer folks. The ongoing murders of trans women\u2014particularly those of color\u2014speak to a deep and entrenched toxic combination of internalized racism and unhealthy masculinity that continues to inhabit our communities.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time for people to recognize that the most marginalized voices in the room\u2014those of trans women of color\u2014should be centered in our conversations when we are talking about getting free. Maybe our human family can stop the feuding over gender-identity labels and start thinking more broadly about what it means to be a man or a woman or genderqueer. That said, I\u2019m not going to label this video as a catalyst for that freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I am going to call it a start.", "keywords": ["jayzs", "queer", "im", "seat", "finally", "family", "video", "black", "woman", "tokenism", "belongs", "trans", "women", "major", "men", "feud", "table", "jay", "statement", "makes"], "polarity": 0.13311459667093473, "subjectivity": 0.527593896713615},

So if when people say the vagina is self-cleaning they mean the vagina as in the elastic, muscular canal that makes up part of the female reproductive system, then yes, that is absolutely self-cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tissue that makes up that canal is also very very delicate and wouldn\u2019t thrive with the use of cleansing washes like Summer\u2019s Eve.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re telling people \u201cthe vagina is self-cleaning\u201d as the reason for not washing everything else, meaning your vulva i.e. the external genital organs, you\u2019re just nasty. You absolutely should wash your ass everyday.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, you should use shampoo every once in a while too. Co-washing your hair is like using lotion as your body wash.

Spike Lee\u2019s Crooklyn about a young girl and her family during a summer in 1973 immediately comes to mind. It was tragic, in the way life can sometimes be, but not sensationalistic; funny, again like life, but not foolish.\n\nSo the movie I want to see made would be a \u201cslice of life\u201d work. The focus would be less on the plot and more about the characters. I\u2019m particularly desperate for a character study of two men. Black men. Father and son. Because I\u2019ve never seen that be the focus of any movie and the idea of it fascinates me. I\u2019m neither a father nor a son but I\u2019m so interested in the dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is that moment like when he realizes his father isn\u2019t a superhero? And fallible?

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes.

That incredibly painful sensation that began several years ago. Thankfully, this time, with not nearly as much vengeance as in previous years.\n\n\n\nYou see, it was almost four years ago on New Year\u2019s Eve that I spent the evening\u2019s dropping of the ball sitting inside a cold, sterile veterinarian hospital on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, listening to doctors tell me that my nearly 14-year-old dog was not going to make it. One short week later, the doctors\u2019 premonition came true, and my earthly angel transitioned into the heavenly realm.\n\nOn Jan. 7, 2014, I walked out of that hospital in New York City with an empty dog carrier and a heart broken into a million pieces. So when this time of year approaches, in spite of my tremendous healing and growth, my body and spirit seem to naturally remember that dark and lonely period of my life when all of my past grievances, hurt and disappointments came pouring out with my unexpected loss.\n\nFor some of us, the holidays mark a very joyous and spirited occasion. But for many, it is also a time of sadness and even despair as many remember their losses and their loved ones who are no longer with them during the festive celebrations. Christmas also tends to magnify our current struggles and challenges. While on one hand we may feel celebratory, on the other, we\u2019re counting down the days until the holidays are over and we\u2019re ushering in the new year, putting our past further behind us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere you do you find yourself this holiday season?\n\nMy greatest lesson in self-love came to me during those darkest moments of grief and loss, when I discovered the power of honoring my feelings\u2014allowing every dark, fearful, lonely, uncertain, empty, crazy and unpredictable emotion to express itself and offering it my sincerest kindness, compassion and patience. I trusted that my healing toward wholeness would eventually come through my commitment to myself and to my feelings.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did, and that\u2019s what I continue to do each Christmas holiday and each day of the year: I give myself permission to feel all of my feelings, without judgment, comparison or the need to appease others. This process has strengthened and empowered me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur feelings belong to us, and each of us has the right to experience them completely. They are the gateway toward our healing. We don\u2019t have to try to repress our negative emotions. We can feel them, hold them, release them and then make a way for love.\n\nSome of the best gifts we receive will come unwrapped this holiday season. This Christmas\u2014or whatever your holiday tradition\u2014can you give yourself the gift of permission? Permission to honor your feelings, your heart, your voice and your desires. They are your birthright. They are your position of power. Whatever you may feel this holiday season, know that it is OK. You can still shine brightly with all the other holiday gifts and baubles under the Christmas tree without being a scrooge.\n\nOur Act of Love No. 4 is to give ourselves the intangible gifts from the holiday season. Maybe that looks like permission to you, or forgiveness toward someone else\u2014or self-forgiveness. Maybe it looks like gratitude or compassion. The truth about empowering our self-expression is that while other tangible gifts will fade and lose their shine and significance, the strength and power we gain from honoring ourselves is what will carry us toward love and wholeness and will buffer us from our challenges with greater ease and grace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis holiday season, I wish you grace and love through the joys and sorrows of Christmas.

They mixed ingredients at their kitchen table, creating products that would enhance the look, feel and health of curly hair, since there were almost none on the market at that time. It was a technique learned from their beloved paternal grandmother, Jessie Mae Branch, described on the company\u2019s website as a \u201ctell it like it is\u201d woman who was known to \u201ctear up hind parts if she had to.\u201d Money was tight, and Miko and Titi did what they had to to grow their business and brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy sister and I pooled our resources, and those were not money resources; they were our God-given talents. My sister was a great communicator and great organizer, and she was a great big sister. I was good at hair and understood the beauty business. The magic came when we got together,\u201d Miko Branch recalls. \u201c[But] we weren\u2019t sophisticated when it came time to source loans. What we did do was sacrifice. We wore each other's clothes, we were roommates, we took in another roommate and put a premium on value and innovation at \u2026 the salon. When we created the product there was nothing like Curly Pudding. We put a price on it and were able to slowly build our business.\u201d\n\nBy 2004 the sisters had created Miss Jessie\u2019s Curly Pudding, named after their grandmother. Women with curly, coily and kinky hair flocked to Brooklyn to buy the product. Branch told the Atlanta Tribune that along with their grandmother, the legendary hair, beauty and business pioneer Madam C.J. Walker inspired the sisters and taught them that success was possible. They started selling their products at Sodafine, a now-defunct women-owned thrift shop in Brooklyn\u2019s Fort Greene neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we were there is we could no longer service people coming to our brownstone because we lived there! People were ringing our bell to get this curl magic in a jar. I was a single mom and my son and I were sleeping on the fourth floor,\u201d Branch says, laughing. \u201cPeople were ringing our bell at ungodly hours and you couldn\u2019t buy the product unless you were a client with an appointment. So my sister and I strolled into a store on DeKalb [Avenue]. We were going to do a 60-40 cut \u2026 we were willing to take 40 because we were desperate \u2026 but these two girls said why don\u2019t we just do it 50-50 \u2026 and we were able to be fair with each other.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year later, the sisters renamed their salon Miss Jessie\u2019s, and it continues to sell a line of products clients rave about, including Curly Meringue and Pillow Soft Curls. They later started selling their product at Ricky\u2019s, a New York-based beauty emporium, and their curly-hair line is available now at nationwide chains such as Target.\n\nTragedy struck in 2014 when Titi Branch lost her battle against depression and took her own life in December. Miko still mourns the loss of her big sister but wants people to know that it is possible, if painful, to endure such a devastating tragedy.\n\n\u201cWhen something devastating like a death takes place, the first reaction is to break down and really embrace that loss. It\u2019s very painful, and it's one of the hardest things I have experienced,\u201d Branch says. \u201cBut because I kept my head, I was able to operate and still be a mom and keep my own sanity. It\u2019s very important to stay calm and stay focused.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiko Branch has battled on, and says the next step for her is taking more time for herself and her family after having hit most of her business goals.\n\n\u201cMy business has surpassed anything I could imagine. [But] with the loss of my sister, I\u2019m putting a value on life and the quality of life,\u201d Branch muses. \u201cThere is more for me to do personally, more happiness to touch on. I\u2019m figuring out ways to extend my life and be a happy and healthy human being.\u201d\n\nAllison Keyes is an award-winning correspondent, host and author.

In her death, my greatest fear had been realized, and adjusting to that \u201cnew normal\u201d wasn\u2019t easy. My mother was my center; I\u2019d lost my center and was a complete mess.\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, I was exactly where I was supposed to be in 2016. I\u2019d placed entirely too many expectations on my healing process because I was trying to fulfill the expectations of others: Your mother raised you to be strong. She prepared you for this. You can do this. In many ways, I felt like I had to have a phenomenal 2017 to counter the horrors of 2016\u2014just to prove everyone right.\n\nThus, \u201cthe Year of the Glow Up.\u201d\n\nBut despite my best efforts, 2017 didn\u2019t glow like I thought it would. On top of still grieving Mama, my doctoral program wasn\u2019t giving me the time and support I needed to process her loss\u2014yet still demanded I meet the rigors of pursuing my degree at maximum speed. Then, while also trying to heal from a devastating heartbreak that ultimately went viral, a date friends pushed me to go on to get over my heartache ended in rape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety, I was hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric facility. Just a few months later, what a police officer referred to as a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d resulted in my being unnecessarily arrested and processed for having an expired registration on a legally registered car. If all of that wasn\u2019t enough, as I recently recuperated from surgery, a friend came to visit me on her way to celebrate the upcoming wedding of that great heartbreak\u2014a man whose bed I\u2019d just left 11 months ago and celebrated my birthday and Christmas with this time last year.\n\nAnd for 2017\u2019s final blow, four members of my family ended up in the hospital at the same time, with my aunt passing away the day after my birthday and my cousin 48 hours later. In the week before Christmas, my family attended two funerals. If 2017 was supposed to be the Year of the Glow Up, it was missing a few bulbs.\n\nA few weeks ago, one of my mentors called me simply to say, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d It took a while to believe her. I haven\u2019t always been gentle with myself these past two years. I\u2019ve made assumptions about how I should\u2019ve reacted or healed from certain traumas, and have been brutal with myself when I didn\u2019t hit those benchmarks. My mentor\u2019s words reminded me that despite it all, I\u2019m still here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are not given instructions on how to navigate life\u2019s treacherous spots, but every day that we rise to meet the sun and face a new day, we are healing and finding our way. There were days when my glow was a flame, times my fierceness was on full display, and I walked in the world with confidence. Then there were days when that glow was only a flicker, my only accomplishments taking a shower, putting on pajamas and getting right back into bed.\n\nIronically, all of that is the beauty of the \u201cglow up.\u201d Light is still light. Even in its smallest quantity, it pierces darkness. The unrealistic expectations we have of ourselves are unnecessary. All we really have to do is show up, give whatever our best is at the time, and trust that the universe will do the rest.\n\n2017 also gave me moments of deep joy in the midst of my trauma and heartache. Whether it was the Fenty Beauty launch, a cautious first date or FaceTime with my girls, I gave myself permission to get lost in laughter, love and happiness. I watched one of my closest friends take on breast cancer with her own brand of magic\u2014and win. Earlier this month, I attended a dinner for black women in digital media and was reminded that the gifts I bring into the world matter. And as we speak, I\u2019m holding my best friend\u2019s daughter, born the day before my mother\u2019s birthday, and celebrating her first Christmas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, I didn\u2019t lack any of the things I needed to remember that life isn\u2019t over. When we are hit hard, I truly believe the universe finds ways to remind us that the pain we endure is not the sum total of who we are. We have always been so much more.\n\nIn 2017\u2019s whirlwind, seeing my therapist every week to work through these experiences and emotions has been divine. Having been in consistent therapy for over a year, I am able to gauge my growth in ways that make me proud. I trust my own voice and know what wellness and wholeness look like on me. I\u2019ve learned the necessity of being surrounded by healthy people and operating in healthy spaces. I\u2019ve learned to give people room to grow, as I haven\u2019t always been in this space of good mental and emotional health. I recognize that life is hard for all of us\u2014and instead of making it harder, we need more folk who will work to soften the land with compassion and empathy.\n\nIn declaring 2017 \u201cthe Year of the Glow Up,\u201d I set out to prove a point I never needed to make. It was perfectly fine to be undone by the tragedies of life. I am not superhuman; I am affected by what happens to me, and 2017 taught me that lesson more than any other year in my life. I had nowhere to hide and couldn\u2019t fake a glamorous glow even if I wanted. This year, my glow has been all about the truth of my experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve navigated 2017 with depths of heartache some people will never see in a lifetime. Every day, it has been too much and unfair. Yet I\u2019ve come to know grace and humility in intimate and life-sustaining ways. To be on the other side of all of it means there\u2019s a power inside me that I didn\u2019t know was there. I\u2019m grateful for that power and ready to activate it, living into all of the possibilities of my greatness. And that greatness doesn\u2019t mean 12 months of consecutive wins, but the courage to keep living when the losses inevitably come. Without question, I had a glow up this year\u2014one that, when I look back at it now, completely takes my breath away.\n\nMany of us had a hard 2017. But in just a few hours, it will be over. There will be those who tell us that just because the year changes, our circumstances will not. I hope we don\u2019t listen to them. I hope we have enough faith to believe that things can and will be different. Hard times don\u2019t last forever\u2014I\u2019m affirming that for all of us.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel.

Stay strong and find motivation.\u201d Two years ago, I applied this same perspective to pole dancing. I transitioned from joking about having two left feet to signing up for a pole dancing course; I left feeling excited and hopeful.\n\n\n\nBefore long, I performed in a pole dancing showcase in the middle of marathon and obstacle-course training, as another demonstration of my athleticism. But despite my sense of pride, rampant stigmas about the sport persist. I\u2019ve experienced everything from being told that it\u2019s too \u201cprovocative\u201d to being personally reminded that I am a parent who needs to \u201cmaintain my integrity.\u201d To debunk a few stereotypes about this highly athletic activity, I spoke with five fierce pole athletes about their experiences as instructors, performers and students.\n\n1. Ashley Fox\n\nAshley Fox, owner and pole sport instructor of Foxy Fitness & Pole in New York City and New Jersey, is a powerhouse who\u2019s earned numerous accolades from competitions across the world. Her extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes several pole dancing competitions, including the 2016 Paragon Championship. She was subsequently first runner-up in the 2017 Pole Olympia Championship. She will be holding workshops at the International Pole Convention and Pole Expo in late 2018.\n\nDespite her gymnastics, dance and cheerleading background, Fox found her athleticism in pole training. \u201cPole is the best because it combines elements from all forms of fitness and dance. The challenge of mastering strength, flexibility and dance really maximizes your physical ability,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore pole, I just felt like my body was regular; now I feel strong and feminine. I see myself as a beauty beast.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Yumiko Harris\n\nFox\u2019s general manager and pole sport instructor Yumiko Harris shared similar sentiments about the intense sport. Harris, a contemporary-dance graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, went through an artistic freeze after being burned-out by college. Before becoming the 2017 Northeast Pole Championship first place winner, she even experienced a stint of depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough a cousin\u2019s encouragement, she signed up for her first pole class. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intrigued by the appeal of bringing on your sexy,\u201d Harris says. Despite her self-proclaimed lackluster first experience, she left feeling invigorated about dancing again.\n\nAfter researching the requirements of becoming a pole dancing instructor, she took a leap of faith, leaving Chicago and pursuing a career as an instructor at Fox\u2019s New York City studio. \u201cPole dancing is empowering to the mind, body and soul because it\u2019s an individual or team sport,\u201d Harris says. \u201cIt creates that community of women becoming stronger together, not through sexuality but strength. We\u2019ve come so far now with pole sport that they\u2019re pushing it into the Olympics.\u201d\n\n3. Veronica Jamison\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIllustrator Veronica Jamison took a similar route, letting her interest lead her to becoming an instructor. Jamison, a pole dance instructor at Pole Haus in Philadelphia, went from taking pole classes once or twice a week to embarking on a teacher-training program just months after enrollment. Despite her recreational dancer background, she sometimes felt out of place being a curvy plus-size woman.\n\n\u201cI have been a curvy woman my entire adult life,\u201d Jamison says. \u201cPole dancing has been instrumental in me getting over my body image issues. It really made me appreciate my body, transitioning from wanting to change it to getting into the mold of being marveled at for what it can do. Before I started pole dancing, I was really self-conscious about my body\u2014the fact that I work in fashion didn\u2019t help. Being around my pole family, seeing others not self-conscious about their bodies or passing judgment, helped me appreciate what I can do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten feedback like, \u2018What is your husband saying?\u2019 And if people have something to say about it, they have their own assumptions about it. It\u2019s not my job to convince them why I do it,\u201d she adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Tina Powell\n\nActress and pole dancer Tina Powell has been teaching for a little over a year at the Choreography House in North Hollywood and Evolve Pole Dance in Los Angeles. She admits that like many, her perception of pole dancing was initially askew:\n\nI came to pole dancing accidentally by winning a free class. I never would\u2019ve tried it otherwise. I am generally an open-minded person and feel women can do as they please with their bodies, as long as no one is harmed. Yet I used to have reservations about stripping and pole dancing. I assumed exotic dancers must have emotional issues [and] low self-esteem and standards if they were \u201cselling sex\u201d and their bodies. Because of these misconceptions, I never saw the draw to pole dancing as a hobby, and I certainly didn\u2019t think of it as a sport. I realize now that pole dancing is not necessarily about sexuality. There are so many different styles of pole, though I prefer the sensual type. But I know when I dance, I\u2019m never thinking about sex or that unsolicited dick pic. Rather, pole dancing is about letting go of self-judgment, and moving with purpose. A huge part of a woman\u2019s power is in her sensuality. That power intimidates many men and makes them feel a need to shame us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Roz Mays\n\nConversely, National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer and 10-year pole dancer Roz \u201cthe Diva\u201d Mays doesn\u2019t have a dancer background. \u201cMy first class was disaster dot com,\u201d she says. \u201cI love to dance and I have a Beyonc\u00e9 complex. I remember coming home thinking it\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and it\u2019s still the hardest sport I\u2019ve done, but I love it.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t have preconceptions about the activity, she took it on as a hobby through a class offered at Crunch Gym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through different periods of my own style where I want to be Black Swan, and other times where I want to dance like Black Chyna,\u201d Mays continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotype that we\u2019re a bunch of hos or wannabe strippers. We\u2019re actually not\u2014and shoutout to strippers, because they work 10 times harder than we do.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Mays is no stranger to hazing from the internet:\n\nPeople think that me doing a sport at my size is promoting obesity. There\u2019s isn\u2019t anything that people can write about me on the internet that\u2019s worse than anything that I said about myself. When people call me fat, ugly or a man, it\u2019s still 10 times nicer than the things that I said. Before poling, I thought I was disgusting beyond belief. There was no relationship between me and my body. After pole, I am starting to heal. Never once in my lifetime have I embraced my body. People make that assumption and it\u2019s not true\u2014I have a better view of myself physically, but I have 30 years of damage, and it\u2019s going to take some years to reverse it. For the first four or five years, I thought I was too big to wear pole shorts. When I did get the guts, it was like the weight of the world lifted off of my shoulders. I remember the first class that I did that six years ago; I cried until my eyes were swimming on my bed. It was a relief cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross the board, all five instructors strongly urged potential students to attend just one class. Neither sweaty palms nor a lack of upper body strength serves as an excuse to avoid trying. Instead, be consistent and present and learn the foundation. Regardless of your shape, size, gender or disability, you should feel comfortable coming to class. If a one-armed pole dancer can eloquently pursue her passion on the pole, you shouldn\u2019t let stereotypes discourage you. \u201cDo your research, wear shorts and let us do the rest,\u201d says Yumiko Harris. Investigate which style works best for you, and allow pole dancing to invigorate your life in the new year.\n\n", "keywords": ["pole", "instructor", "dancer", "class", "gravity", "athletes", "harris", "dance", "defying", "body", "dare", "sport", "feel", "stereotypesand", "try", "dancing", "debunk"], "polarity": 0.14718147641831852, "subjectivity": 0.485269274585064},

That incredibly painful sensation that began several years ago. Thankfully, this time, with not nearly as much vengeance as in previous years.\n\n\n\nYou see, it was almost four years ago on New Year\u2019s Eve that I spent the evening\u2019s dropping of the ball sitting inside a cold, sterile veterinarian hospital on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, listening to doctors tell me that my nearly 14-year-old dog was not going to make it. One short week later, the doctors\u2019 premonition came true, and my earthly angel transitioned into the heavenly realm.\n\nOn Jan. 7, 2014, I walked out of that hospital in New York City with an empty dog carrier and a heart broken into a million pieces. So when this time of year approaches, in spite of my tremendous healing and growth, my body and spirit seem to naturally remember that dark and lonely period of my life when all of my past grievances, hurt and disappointments came pouring out with my unexpected loss.\n\nFor some of us, the holidays mark a very joyous and spirited occasion. But for many, it is also a time of sadness and even despair as many remember their losses and their loved ones who are no longer with them during the festive celebrations. Christmas also tends to magnify our current struggles and challenges. While on one hand we may feel celebratory, on the other, we\u2019re counting down the days until the holidays are over and we\u2019re ushering in the new year, putting our past further behind us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere you do you find yourself this holiday season?\n\nMy greatest lesson in self-love came to me during those darkest moments of grief and loss, when I discovered the power of honoring my feelings\u2014allowing every dark, fearful, lonely, uncertain, empty, crazy and unpredictable emotion to express itself and offering it my sincerest kindness, compassion and patience. I trusted that my healing toward wholeness would eventually come through my commitment to myself and to my feelings.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did, and that\u2019s what I continue to do each Christmas holiday and each day of the year: I give myself permission to feel all of my feelings, without judgment, comparison or the need to appease others. This process has strengthened and empowered me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur feelings belong to us, and each of us has the right to experience them completely. They are the gateway toward our healing. We don\u2019t have to try to repress our negative emotions. We can feel them, hold them, release them and then make a way for love.\n\nSome of the best gifts we receive will come unwrapped this holiday season. This Christmas\u2014or whatever your holiday tradition\u2014can you give yourself the gift of permission? Permission to honor your feelings, your heart, your voice and your desires. They are your birthright. They are your position of power. Whatever you may feel this holiday season, know that it is OK. You can still shine brightly with all the other holiday gifts and baubles under the Christmas tree without being a scrooge.\n\nOur Act of Love No. 4 is to give ourselves the intangible gifts from the holiday season. Maybe that looks like permission to you, or forgiveness toward someone else\u2014or self-forgiveness. Maybe it looks like gratitude or compassion. The truth about empowering our self-expression is that while other tangible gifts will fade and lose their shine and significance, the strength and power we gain from honoring ourselves is what will carry us toward love and wholeness and will buffer us from our challenges with greater ease and grace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis holiday season, I wish you grace and love through the joys and sorrows of Christmas.

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list? Only time will tell, but he belongs on it.", "keywords": ["rank", "hes", "thought", "list", "black", "high", "best", "roots", "gets", "band", "rap", "doesnt", "think", "goat", "lists", "mc"], "polarity": 0.16205021211183182, "subjectivity": 0.480274232809444},

She\u2019s built a successful and evolving brand that started on the strength of one product: her best-selling \u201cLip Whip.\u201d Famed for smudge-free saturation in no fewer than 45 shades (and counting), the day-to-night finish is vegan, nontoxic and 100 percent cruelty-free ... and so tough to budge that it requires its own remover.\n\nAccording to Cashmere Nicole, it was a formula built out of necessity:\n\nI think Beauty Bakerie introduced a lifestyle change; a complete makeover or face-lift to how the makeup-application process works, and how we should approach that overall. Putting on makeup is exhausting\u2014I think we just need to be real. ... And then, you want to pile on the layer of being a parent, or the layers of the 9-to-5, or all of the other different obligations that we have as individuals ... And I think that was a big component to me: How do I make this easier for myself? How can I make it through my day without having to be completely flatlined by the makeup-application process?\n\nIt was an instinct that paid off. In six short years, the CEO has guided the brand from a solo venture to a staff of 30, and from lips to full-face glamour. Her Flour setting powders offer the same all-day dependability as her lip colors, and a line of concealers are on deck for 2018. Meanwhile, her eye shadow palettes fly off the shelves of both her online and San Diego Beauty Bakerie boutiques\u2014especially her \u201cCoffee & Cocoa\u201d palette, created for her teenage daughter and emblazoned with her personal and professional motto: \u201cBetter, not bitter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough successful, the past six years have been bittersweet for Cashmere Nicole. Soon after launching Beauty Bakerie in 2011 at the age of 27, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, a recurring prognosis that would eventually require a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. Now 33, she remains optimistic and forward-thinking:\n\nYou know, I often tell people that I\u2019m living in my afterlife, after just going through maybe 10 years of feeling as though a lot of things weren\u2019t working out the way that I would want them to; just setback after setback. So, I think in that process you become a bit conditioned to say, \u201cI\u2019ve got to expect the worst but hope for the best.\u201d And in hindsight, I don\u2019t particularly like that way of thinking. It worked for me at that time, but after going through a life-changing experience with cancer and looking back now, I would say that it\u2019s just better to focus on the things that are working for you\u2014the things that you know you can do for sure\u2014and do away with things that you can\u2019t change.\n\nAnd she\u2019s definitely changing the makeup game. In her own evolution from a teenage mother putting herself through nursing school to socking away every spare dollar to start Beauty Bakerie, and recently garnering a $3 million seed investment from Unilever Ventures, Cashmere Nicole is redefining what a beauty mogul looks like. And while she\u2019s a self-confessed \u201cserial entrepreneur from the age of 12,\u201d she admits that she\u2019s learning as she grows her business:\n\nI think I am pretty tough, just based on feedback from some of the people around me, but sometimes I even question that. So, I think you have to have a delicate balance of knowing when to be sugar and when to be shit, a little. And I think I\u2019m still learning how to balance both of them; and [that\u2019s] the tough part about being a CEO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith pending expansion into retailers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Beauty Bakerie\u2019s growing international presence on home-shopping giant QVC, and a daughter heading off to college soon, it looks like Nicole\u2019s balancing act is going to get quite a workout. But she\u2019s more than up to the challenge:\n\nYou know, walking out of a doctor\u2019s office and being told you have cancer; you can cry, but what do you do? Go dig a grave for yourself and lay in it? I mean, you have to keep going; and that applies to everything. ... My best advice for staying power is that when the whole world and all of your friends might tell you that the easiest thing is to turn around and go back, you should do the exact opposite. You should keep going forward, because in that walk and in that journey of staying, you do become powerful, and you become stronger. And you will fall, and you will hurt yourself, and you will cry.

That might have looked like spending more time than usual in the gym, prepping healthier meals in the kitchen or making that important business call that\u2019s incessantly been put off.\n\nSo how are you doing thus far? More important, how are you feeling?\n\n\n\nThe journey to self-love can create a potpourri of emotions. We aren\u2019t always taught to love ourselves, so when we actually begin the practice, oftentimes old, stored emotions begin to boil to the surface. In those moments, remember to engage your self-love practice of kindness, patience, compassion and no judgment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, we\u2019re going to continue the holiday tradition of giving by giving ourselves something we rarely, if ever, give to ourselves: compliments.

For our Act of Love No. 3, we\u2019re going to sing ourselves praises. Not to be confused with self-conceit, which stems from self-doubt and insecurity. Self-praise is our opportunity to focus on our strengths and what we like about ourselves.\n\n\n\nThis week, each day, can you give yourself at least one compliment and write it down in a journal? It can include any of your attributes and strengths related to you physically, spiritually, personally, professionally, athletically, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you can come up with more than one each day, go for it! Sing yourself praises! You deserve it. And if you\u2019re really feeling good about yourself, how about a little wink to yourself in the mirror?

After writing about the season finale of Insecure last week, I wanted to move on to other topics for discussion. But then, at last night\u2019s Emmys, Rae, in a moment of candor, found a way to make all her fans proud to be a part of the #IssaHive. When asked who she was rooting for, she responded, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing shocking about this statement to anybody who has grown up black and rooted for damn near anything in their life. It is a mantra for any of us who have watched any competition in which one of the competitors looks like us, sounds like us or is familiar to us.\n\nI remember as a kid watching shows like Family Feud, Double Dare and even American Gladiators, competitions in which there were absolutely zero stakes for me, and if there was a black competitor, I was rooting for them. Back then, I never thought deeply about this sort of fan appreciation. My rationale was simple: Black contestants, even on shows like the ones I mentioned, were rare, and therefore, rooting for them was done more out of a feeling that if I didn\u2019t do it then, I probably wasn\u2019t going to get another chance.\n\n\n\nBut in hindsight, I realized that part of my thinking was programmed by the way I would learn about black history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe way black history is taught to us in school is through the guise of firsts. From a very early age, most of the black people we learn about are put under a lens of exceptionalism. We learn about a black person who overcame a system of oppression and racism to become the first black person to accomplish everything from being the first African-American world heavyweight champion (Jack Johnson) to sitting at the front of a bus (Rosa Parks), and even those stories are sometimes distorted (shoutout to Claudette Colvin), but I digress.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s this sort of conditioning that lends itself to our cheering for our own out of solidarity. As Scoop Jackson once said, anytime you hear about a first black person winning or accomplishing anything of note, it is a reminder that racism exists. Issa Rae\u2019s statement last night exemplified that.\n\n\n\nAlready there are people who took Rae\u2019s words as racist, but in fact, her comment was rooting against racism. When Issa said she was rooting for everybody black, she was rooting for a new history to be made. She was rooting for Lena Waithe (Master of None) to be the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing. She was rooting for Donald Glover (Atlanta) to be the first black person to win for comedy-series directing. She was rooting for Sterling K. Brown (This Is Us) to be the first black actor since 1998 to win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo for the same reasons I grew up rooting for Tiger Woods, Venus and Serena Williams, Barack Obama and any black contestant I saw on Jeopardy, Issa Rae was rooting for Donald Glover, Lena Waithe and Sterling K. Brown. There are so few of us in spaces like the Emmys that we rarely ever get the chance to root for us. So when we see us in those spaces, we may not know the full backstory, but we do know the history, and we\u2019re rooting for it to change.", "keywords": ["raes", "im", "person", "win", "black", "way", "rae", "history", "issa", "rooting", "racism", "learn", "fubu", "everybody"], "polarity": 0.09541889483065953, "subjectivity": 0.4461115355233002},

She\u2019s a woman who would know, given her degree from Harvard in ninth- to 14th-century Arabic literature and diplomacy. For nine years, Akkad has held the position of senior vice president of local and cultural innovation at Est\u00e9e Lauder, overseeing multiethnic innovation for some 25 brands under the Lauder umbrella, including La Mer, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. But Akkad\u2019s journey to the top of the beauty business had an unlikely beginning: It began at age 19, when she went off to do a semester abroad at the American University in Cairo in 1984.\n\nIt\u2019s a gorgeous, sunny afternoon in New York City, and Akkad and I are having lunch at Freds in Barneys New York on Madison Avenue, where fashion folk gather to see and be seen. Over salads and crab cakes (we split the fries), Akkad recounts her student days in Egypt.\n\n\u201cEgypt wasn\u2019t conservative at all at that time; women were in Western dress, and the caf\u00e9 at the American University was the big expat hangout for students and diplomatic hopefuls like myself,\u201d she says, adding a caveat that adds significant intrigue. \u201cEvery spy in the world was crawling the campus and lounging in the caf\u00e9 looking for recruits.\u201d\n\nThe American University Caf\u00e9 was also where Susan spied the love of her life: fellow student and theater major Ahmed Akkad. The two have now been married for over 30 years.\n\nEgypt is also where she began what would become a lifelong love affair with beauty and fragrance. In the age of the pharaohs, men and women alike wore statement eyeliner and fabulous wigs; to this day, fragrance in Egypt remains a daily multilayered ritual where everything from hair to furniture is perfumed like the wearer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrushing aside dreams of a diplomatic career, Susan relocated with her new husband to New York, where they placed their priorities on making a living\u2014no obvious feat, with two very esoteric degrees (his is in comparative literature and theater). While Ahmed launched a fashion line, Susan found a job as assistant to the sportswear editor at American Vogue, which paid $15,000 a year in 1986. In need of more money, she quickly moved on to a (slightly) better-paying job as a public relations assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder. Starting salary? $16,000.\n\nLanding a job in beauty after dreams of a diplomatic career may seem odd, but in the buttoned-up multinational corporate world of luxury beauty, it was once de rigueur to hire the wives of State Department officials in public relations and similar roles in international business. Their experience organizing official dinners, navigating the social and international worlds, and connections to wealthy society made them the organic influencers of that time.\n\nAs an entry-level assistant at Est\u00e9e Lauder, Susan was allowed the chance to watch and learn from all departments. She laughs as she recalls getting dry-cleaning and throwing birthday parties for a boss\u2019s cat as part of her duties. What she learned was what it takes to work every rung of the corporate ladder; but most important, she learned that she loved the beauty biz\u2014especially fragrance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Ahmed\u2019s fashion line took off as a global luxury brand, Susan left the corporate world to work in her husband\u2019s company. In 1995, Ahmed sold the fashion brand to his manufacturers to start interiors, accessories and other businesses. Susan was now unemployed, and through some recommendations from friends, she found her way to Lanc\u00f4me as director of fragrance.\n\nSusan Akkad was soon recruited back to Est\u00e9e Lauder, where she served in various global marketing positions for almost 10 years before being installed in her current post as senior VP of local and cultural innovation, responsible for multiethnic innovation. What exactly does multicultural innovation entail? In this role, Akkad partners with the many brands under Est\u00e9e Lauder to advise on multicultural strategy and the best ways to tailor products and communication to be more meaningful to women of color.\n\nHer post at Lauder affords her a global view of the beauty of black and brown women, who, she tells me, are more confident about their looks than their white counterparts. As a culture, we black women historically have primarily based our self-esteem surrounding our looks on the opinions within our community, rather than on mainstream media standards. Akkad recounts being asked why certain products advertised as corrective were not appealing to black women. To which she would answer, that\u2019s because \u201cwhen you market a product to black women as if there is something wrong with them that needs fixing, black women simply don\u2019t relate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking me straight in the eye, Akkad lightly brushes back one of her naturally ink-black curls and straightens the peaked lapel of her black Junya Watanabe tuxedo suit.

Tip to toe. The reigning Queen of Elephant Skin. Dry winter skin has my hands looking like I\u2019m half eagle; I need a manicure so badly. In short, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nBut true confession? Mani-pedis are one of the areas in my beauty routine where I am consistently thrifty with both my time and money, and where do-it-yourself consistently does my body good.\n\nAnd while I love a great polish, I\u2019ve learned that daily little acts of kindness to oneself are a major part of maintaining great, camera-ready natural nails. So I\u2019ve turned it into a major part of my self-care routine. Let\u2019s dive in:\n\nSweet and Soft\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be out here looking like the walking dead. I do hand-to-hand combat with the cold by making my own sugar, exfoliating scrub. I prefer sugar over salt, after Dr. Shirley Madhere, a New York City holistic plastic surgeon (yes, that\u2019s a real thing), revealed that \u201cordinary sugar contains lactic acid and lipids that are the closest to our skin\u2019s own composition,\u201d and which are also extremely fast acting for fighting dryness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s easy to mix your own scrub at home. I like to mix the following:\n\n1 cup coarse sugar\n\n\u00bd cup coconut oil or olive oil (add an essential oil, like rose or lavender, if you want to get fancy)\n\nMix the ingredients together in a bowl until you get a goopy consistency, being careful to add the oil slowly so that the sugar retains the grainy texture essential to exfoliation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring your shower or bath time, rub your hands thoroughly and gently with the mixture for 60 seconds; don\u2019t forget the webbing in between your fingers and toes, which shows telltale signs of dryness. Let the oils and the sugar sit on your skin for another minute at least to maximize the hydration.\n\nDon\u2019t Make Me Cut You\n\nOn the manicure tip, I lose my mind when my cuticles peel down and stick up like dried-out flower petals around my nail beds. Trim your cuticles too short, or clip them multiple times instead of cutting them off in one motion, and it causes this kind of peeling effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m a fan of pushing back cuticles over cutting, but you\u2019ve got to be conscientious to make it work.\n\nBathing is the optimal situation for cuticle maintenance. Cuticles softened by water make it easy to push them down with your thumbnails. Don\u2019t worry if the cuticles pile up at the base of your nails like mini snowbanks; they\u2019ll dry down flat and neat after absorbing the moisture from the bath.\n\nTo seal the deal, brush on a little cuticle remover and cuticle oil once you\u2019re done with your soak. In fact, the smart money move is using cuticle remover and cuticle oil on the daily. I splurge on Butter London, but Sally Hansen also does wonders to help extend your manicure for up to two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNice and Smooth\n\nWhen it comes to hand lotion, I apply it three times a day. The more you put on, the merrier your melanin gets. That said, we all live a touch screen life on our phones and computers, so lotion that\u2019s deeply hydrating but nongreasy is a must. Zandra Lemon Tea Tree Hand and Body Lotion with liquid jojoba wax is a winner. Another personal fave? Super Goop Forever Young Hand Cream, which is highly emollient, absorbs quickly and has a high SPF (sun protection factor).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet on the Good Foot!\n\nWhat\u2019s going on inside my shoes is scandalous as hell! Friction from running, yoga and spinning class can quickly cause dry skin and callouses to build up. If I don\u2019t stay on top of it, it\u2019s heavy lifting to get my feet looking human again (and not like the hooves on one of those blue characters in the movie Avatar).\n\nBurt\u2019s Bees Foot Cream more than does the job to soothe parched feet. I slather it on my toes when I work out with socks and sneakers on\u2014though obviously not before a barefoot yoga class. It saves me (and my marriage) from wearing foot cream and unsexy socks to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFoot file or a pumice stone? I use both. Pumice stones work best to remove calluses on wet skin; foot files are most effective when skin is dry. I prefer the file because it\u2019s more sanitary; skin sloughs off straight into the wastebasket, with no residue left on the nonporous file, which rises clean. Pumice stones, while convenient in the tub or shower, hold dead skin and debris, which can breed bacteria.\n\nIronically, scrubbing your feet with stones or files can stimulate calluses as well. I told you, it\u2019s a fight\u2014so, four times a year, I go nuclear in the war on ashiness, using the Baby Foot Exfoliant Foot Peel to completely resurface my feet. These cellophane booties are filled with a clear, slimy goodness, derived from bladderwrack mushroom, burdock root and meadowsweet flower, among 14 other herbal ingredients.\n\nGive your feet a quick soak, slip the booties on for an hour\u2014I use mine while I pay bills or catch up on Black-ish\u2014and then lightly towel off the residue. Nothing happens right way, except your feet feel fresher and more moisturized. But three to five days later, get ready for dead skin walking, and do not make any barefoot plans! Sheets of dead skin will shed from your feet in chunks and swaths, and you\u2019ll want to keep your socks and shoes on for two to three days during the shedding process that will bring your feet back to life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith my routine on lock, polish becomes a perk, not a necessity. A little regular attention ensures that my hands and feet are polished enough.

Master of None\u2019s Lena Waithe became the first African-American woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing, Donald Glover became the first African American to win for comedy-series directing, and Sterling K. Brown became the first black actor since 1998 to win the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series Emmy, for his role as Randall Pearson on NBC\u2019s This Is Us.\n\n\n\nWaithe, whose autobiographical series The Chi was picked up by Showtime, won the award for her writing on Master of None\u2019s \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode, in which her character finally comes out to her family.\n\nDuring Waithe\u2019s acceptance speech, she spoke about LGBTQIA issues and urged viewers to \u201cgo out there and conquer the world. It would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it.\u201d\n\nDecked out in an eggplant-colored tuxedo, Glover continued to make history as he took home the award for directing in a comedy series, for his \u201cB.A.N.\u201d episode of Atlanta, but he also won the comedy-lead-actor Emmy for his role on the series as well. During his speech, he joked about Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most-oppressed list,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the reason I\u2019m up here.\u201d\n\nOutside of comedy, Brown, whose popular series This Is Us heads back to TV later in September, thanked his cast as he accepted his award.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wanna thank my cast. Milo, Mandy, Justin, Chrissy, you are the best white TV family that a brother has ever had, better than the white folks who raised Webster,\u201d Brown said before he was cut off by music.\n\n\u201cYou can play, you can play. Nobody got that loud music. Our writers, I love you. You are our life\u2019s blood. Our producers and directors, I love you,\u201d Brown added.\n\nSocial media was furious that Brown didn\u2019t get enough time to shine onstage:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would have been a great speech on air was finished backstage as Brown thanked his family, writers and friends.\n\nI wanted to thank our writers. A show doesn\u2019t get seven acting nominations without some impeccable, beautiful, thoughtful writing. You guys are our life\u2019s blood, so I want to thank you so much. To our producers and directors, in particular, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, and the crazy cool Ken Olin. I thank you for your guidance and friendship. And I wanted to thank Dan Fogelman\u2014he is the Hebrew hammer with which our house was built. He makes me laugh and cry in equal parts and keeps me coming back for more, and in his own little small special way. He\u2019s not trying to make America great again, he\u2019s trying to make it the best that it\u2019s ever been and I love him for taking me on this journey.\n\nI wanted to thank my manager. You\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and it feels like we\u2019re just getting started. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next.

There are dozens of contenders, but none that have ever truly stuck. Basically, the search for the perfect slur for white people has been like the search for a really good fast-food fish sandwich.\n\n\u201cCracker\u201d is perhaps the most famous one, as it\u2019s been around so long that there are popular modifications to it, most notably \u201ccracka\u201d and the sublime \u201ccracka-ass cracka.\u201d But these feel too retrograde, like one of those insults that seemed old even when it was young. It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

Racism is still alive; they just be concealing it, after all. Or more likely, I\u2019m dazed by the fact that Alabama did the unthinkable, entirely thanks to black people, so I\u2019m feeling greedy. Yo no s\u00e9.\n\nBut the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently announced its 2018 inductees, a list that includes Nina Simone, Bon Jovi, the Cars, Dire Straits, Sister Rosetta Thorpe and the Moody Blues. A fine group of performers, some of whom you love and some of whom you probably hate. It\u2019s music and it\u2019s subjective. But their accomplishments are undeniable. In fact, inquiring why it took so long for all of those people to get in would be fair.\n\nAlso nominated but not selected for 2018? One James Todd Smith, better known to the world as LL Cool J. Including 2018, he\u2019s been on the ballot four times. How in the hell has he NOT gotten in?\n\nI realize that we don\u2019t care about Grammys or Oscars or Halls of Fame or any accolades, especially in hip-hop. Or so we say. According to Phife Dawg (RIP) on the song \u201cAward Tour\u201d from 1993\u2019s Midnight Marauders album, \u201cI\u2019ll never let a statue tell me how nice I am ... \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in 2017, Q-Tip felt a way about being snubbed by the Grammys. So even if we as a community pretend we don\u2019t care, validation is validation and acknowledgment is acknowledgment, and we all like it\u2014especially for hip-hop, which has had to fight and claw its way into being respected by the mainstream gatekeepers DESPITE being the predominant musical form of the USA and, really, the world. I mean, everybody loves Tupac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is not devoid of black artists. They ain\u2019t stupid. Artists from Sam Cooke to Gladys Knight & the Pips to Aretha Franklin to Bo Diddley to Jimmy Cliff to Bob Marley to the Jackson 5 to Michael Jackson all grace the annals of the Hall of Fame. And while I\u2019m sure there was a time when black artists struggled for that acknowledgment, we are all up and through there now.\n\nEXCEPT for the world of hip-hop, where, despite the genre\u2019s contributions to the WORLD, the only current inductees are Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, N.W.A and Tupac. A fine list of people who fit the criteria for the Hall of Fame\u2019s inductees: \u201cArtists\u2014a group encompassing performers, composers and/or musicians ... demonstrating unquestionable musical excellence and talent [who] have had a significant impact on the development, evolution and preservation of rock & roll.\u201d Obviously, the use of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is the widest general definition, considering the various acts and individuals included therein.\n\nBut THEREIN lies my own confusion about the exclusion of LL Cool J. As a cultural icon and embodiment of everything the Hall of Fame exists to showcase, LL should have gone in when Run-DMC did, basically. As a solo act, especially. Every other act belongs there, but so does LL. While LL isn\u2019t the best at ANY particular realm of hip-hop, what he DOES have is the longevity tab on lock. We STILL know this man. He\u2019s still relevant\u2014maybe not as a musical artist, but for what you can do with your hip-hop celebrity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even musically, he gave us Mama Said Knock You Out, Mr. Smith and Bigger and Deffer. He has seven No. 1 rap singles. Four top 10 U.S. singles in a time before hip-hop was entirely embraced by the country. He\u2019s got classic songs and, more important, is the REASON so many of those early rappers even decided to pick up microphones. He\u2019s been influential.\n\nIn hip-hop, he\u2019s one of the most well-known stalwarts of the most famed hip-hop label that\u2019s ever existed. He leveraged his hip-hop bona fides into commercials, movies and television. He took hip-hop to the boardrooms and got that corporate money there. He got FUBU into a Gap commercial.\n\nHow influential does an artist need to be to get that recognition, IF we\u2019re recognizing artists for those reasons? I have no idea if LL Cool J cares. I\u2019m sure he would like to be inducted, since it is a great honor and at this point of his career, musically, that\u2019s about all he has left to accomplish. Maybe it\u2019s not that big a deal to him, but since he\u2019s been nominated, NOT being inducted must be a little annoying, especially on this fourth go-round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure that at some point he\u2019ll get in, as will artists like Jay-Z, Biggie, Puffy, Nas, DJ Kool Herc, DJ Premier and others, on sheer influence on hip-hop alone. I also think that Rakim belongs in there because he was YEARS ahead of his time and his influence cannot be measured even if he doesn\u2019t get universal credit for it. But it would be a shame for him not to get in soon, especially considering the other hip-hop acts that are in, as they\u2019re his contemporaries in the art form. Tupac is moving into the \u201990s. I can\u2019t see a world where LL doesn\u2019t make it, and I hope the Hall of Fame doesn\u2019t, either.", "keywords": ["hes", "j", "im", "hiphop", "cool", "snubbing", "hall", "fame", "artists", "roll", "rock", "ll", "world", "does"], "polarity": 0.1269675925925926, "subjectivity": 0.5079282407407406},

While I\u2019m none too fond of female leaders being posited as the fallback plan for a dysfunctional patriarchy, rather than the highly qualified corrective measure, recent research\u2014including a Gallup poll\u2014seems to agree with our 44th president.\n\nAs reported by CNBC Make It., a recently updated 2012 study by leadership-development firm Zenger Folkman revealed that \u201cwomen scored higher than men in 13 out of the 16 leadership competencies Folkman\u2019s research measure for, tying only for their tendency to be innovative.\u201d\n\nAlso notable is that the study also considered women an \u201cuntapped resource,\u201d despite our prevalence in the workforce. Company president and psychometrician Joe Folkman explained that this could likely be an issue of confidence\u2014on the part of not just working women but also the companies that employ them.\n\n\u201cIn organizations where women don\u2019t feel like second-class citizens and they don\u2019t feel abused, they actually feel empowered. They feel like they\u2019re taken seriously and like they have a future there,\u201d Folkman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain: Ya think?\n\nWhile it\u2019s unknown whether the Zenger Folkman leadership research went further, polling the same categories along racial lines, it\u2019s worth considering that black women are currently the highest-educated group in the United States\u2014and are therefore presumably the most qualified for leadership positions. And yet a 2016 study produced by the American Association of University Women (pdf) indicates that black women occupy a mere 8 percent of private-sector jobs, and only 2 percent of leadership roles.\n\nSo while the leadership potential is there, it remains untapped.

I don\u2019t like the stigma that comes with living here. The cost of living is insane. (Can you say thousands in copays alone each year?) And I hate that people I love have to live here, too, by default.\n\n\n\nBut can I tell you what I hate the very most about being a resident of Crazytown?\n\n\n\nLike, the very most?\n\n\n\nI hate taking meds.\n\n\n\nMy plan is to keep it super-ultrareal in this column\u2014to an extent. I\u2019m not going to sit here and write out all the meds I take and what dosage, et cetera.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019m about to get you damn close.\n\nIn the a.m. I have to take five different meds: two to fight depression, one to keep my moods balanced, one for something that I don\u2019t even remember, but when I tried to wean off it, bad things happened. So I\u2019m just taking it for now. And then one that is an overall med to make sure all my meds play nicely together. (I\u2019ll explain that later.)\n\nIn the p.m. it\u2019s mostly the same thing, except add on an antidepressant that also makes sure I get the right amount of sleep (for all of us in Crazytown, there are some things that are NONNEGOTIABLE, OH, HELL NO, YOU MUST; for me, it\u2019s 10 hours of sleep every single night).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI actually should not say I hate taking meds. I\u2019m grateful that they exist. If it weren\u2019t for these magical capsules, I\u2019d be dead.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not an exaggeration. There\u2019s no acceptable unmedicated version of myself. Take away the meds and within a year \u2026 I don\u2019t even want to think about it. But I know what it looks like. And it\u2019s devastating.\n\n\n\nSo shoutout to the lithium reserves in Bolivia. \u2019Nuff respect to the European Big Pharma companies running sketchy trials on folks. Props to Rite Aid and CVS for keeping me laced up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know my meds are necessary. But because of the way some folks talk about medication, sometimes it makes me feel like I\u2019m flawed. Like I\u2019m a loser because I have to depend on these meds I barely understand in order to pass for normal.\n\n\n\nExample: My New Bae (also known as NB) has accepted my regimen from day one. He\u2019s super supportive and I love him for it. But he drives me crazy because he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in medication for himself.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t do over the counter or prescription meds. If he has a toothache and I offer him some ibuprofen, he waves me off, holding his jaw and talking about how he doesn\u2019t need it. If he has a migraine and I offer something like acetaminophen, he says the headache will just go away on its own. Which is usually true. But why suffer?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I press him for reasons, he says we don\u2019t know what\u2019s really in most medications and how the government makes sure we always need them. I get the sense that he also pats himself on the back for being able to power through pain. Or maybe that\u2019s my own insecurities because I can\u2019t power through Crazytown without meds.\n\n\n\nI wonder\u2014if he broke his leg, would he just hobble around on it? If he were diagnosed with cancer, would he have chemo or just take his chances?\n\n\n\nI call it the broken-leg theory. When someone tells me they wouldn\u2019t take meds for mental health, I ask them what they would do with a broken leg. If you would go seek treatment for your leg, why is your mental health any different? I do believe that all treatment options should be considered for everything: prayer, meditation, yoga, organic coconut oil\u2014all of it. But I don\u2019t see anyone rubbing coconut oil on broken legs. So don\u2019t expect me to rub it on my brain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe the FDA (mostly) does what it\u2019s supposed to do. If Aleve is on the shelves in my Walgreens, I\u2019ll take my chances and use it before I sit around with a raging toothache.\n\n\n\nThis is not to say I don\u2019t know how cruel the American government can be as it pertains to medication and health care\u2014especially for people of color. I get that. I do. But I also know that I don\u2019t have a choice but to hope for the best if a dentist is going to rip a tooth out of my head.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve talked to people who think they may need to move to Crazytown, and sometimes they balk when I talk about meds. I have no patience for these folks. It\u2019s not my place to tell you that you need meds. But I do need you to go that way if you\u2019re fully anti-meds. I\u2019m not the holistic chick who can tell you which brand of tea is used for depression.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s green tea and chamomile tea, by the way. But if tea gets you out of a crippling depression, God bless you, and leave me the hell alone because you don\u2019t live in my neighborhood of Crazytown.\n\n\n\nIf I could drink some damn tea? I would.\n\n\n\nBecause \u2026 let\u2019s talk about side effects.\n\n\n\nOne of my meds completely knocks me out 20 minutes after I take it. And I have to get a minimum of eight hours of sleep or I will be a zombie the next day (it used to be a full 12 hours of sleep until I got used to it). It also makes me severely nauseated.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s the med that randomly gives me hand tremors and sometimes blurry or double vision. It also makes me nauseated!\n\n\n\nAnother med is designed to keep depression away. Great! Well, yeah. But if the dosage is off, it can send me to the other side. Did you know you could be too happy? Yeah. And it\u2019s just as dangerous as being too sad. Also, guess what? This med makes me nauseated, too.\n\n\n\nOne med has helped me pack on 20 extra pounds that are hard as hell to get off. And it makes me crave sugary drinks\u2014especially soda. I\u2019m not kidding. I know I can fight it and I can\u2019t blame it (all) on the med. But it makes you super thirsty. And guess what all the sugary drinks cause: adult acne! I have more acne now than I did in 1988. Oh. This med also makes me nauseated.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took me and my doctor a full YEAR to get the cocktail right\u2014balanced moods that make sense and side effects I can live with (somewhat).\n\n\n\nSo I gotta carry this bag o\u2019 goodies with me everywhere I go. And of course I sometimes forget. I\u2019ve missed events because I forgot my meds and had to go back home. Sometimes I have to take them as soon as I leave a concert or a movie and haul ass to get to my bed. I have this huge senior-citizen-size pillbox that takes 30 minutes to arrange every Sunday. I have an OH SHIT, I FORGOT MY MEDS container in my car and my wallet and one in NB\u2019s apartment.\n\n\n\nSo why? Why take this crap? Why not try a holistic approach? Why give into this crap I don\u2019t even understand?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nBecause one time last year, I lay on my back in my apartment staring at the ceiling. In the center of my belly I could feel an emptiness. I kept my hand on my stomach as if that was going to help. But it didn\u2019t. I knew the emptiness wasn\u2019t really in my belly. It was in my mind, in my heart, in my brain. It felt like something was weighing me down. It felt like nothing could get me out of that bed. If you turned the bed upside down, I\u2019d still be stuck to the mattress.\n\nI stared at that ceiling and I thought about my life: my responsibilities, my work, my babies, my health, my apartment, my ex, my parents, my siblings, the weather outside, 10 years from now, 50 years from now, my dog, coffee, brownie sundaes, the beach \u2026 I tried to close my eyes and visualize all those things I loved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling again. I live in a tiny studio apartment, a converted factory with 17-foot-high ceilings.\n\n\n\nThere are huge exposed pipes running across those ceilings. I tried so very hard to think about the babies and the brownies and the beach and the future.\n\n\n\nBut all I could think about was where to get something long enough to swing up 17 feet in the air and somehow loop around that pipe.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI cried because I knew better. I cried because I knew that wasn\u2019t the answer. I cried because I knew there was a better way. And I cried because I wasn\u2019t sure I was strong enough to stop seeing the solution in my ceiling.\n\n\n\nAfter many years of tinkering (about 10 in all), I have a cocktail that works. Yep, with hand tremors and weight gain and too much Mountain Dew and acne and early bedtimes and more.

Of course, seeing Wakanda brought up a lot of questions: What\u2019s the deal with those sand-like 3D display systems they have? How do they make such good holographic images come out of stylish bracelets? How fast do those mag-lev trains go? And, perhaps most importantly, what are Wakandan cars like?\n\n\n\nOh, I guess I should mention there will likely be some kind of spoilers here, so, you know, I\u2019m warning you now. Here be spoilers. Run.\n\nNow, while we saw a number of very impressive Wakandan transportation machines: aircraft (possibly spacecraft as well?), mag-lev trains, what looked like a nice light-rail system, we never actually saw any Wakandan rolling, car-like automobiles. Perhaps their cities are designed to not require them, or perhaps they prefer mass-transit and air travel culturally; I\u2019m not really sure. But that\u2019s not going to stop me from doing some speculation about what a Wakandan car could be.\n\nI\u2019m actually thinking of a very specific kind of Wakandan car: a Wakandan export-market car. I\u2019m taking as a jumping-off point the events at the end of the movie, where Wakanda is finally abandoning their centuries-long self-imposed isolation from the world and will now become part of the global community, an act which will include the desemination of advanced Wakandan technology to the world, at least to some degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandan technology is based on the (again, sadly) fictional element known as Vibranium, of which Wakanda has an incredibly supply of, thanks to a massive meteorite of the stuff buried beneath the country. We see vibranium powering things like Black Panther\u2019s suit, for example, and it\u2019s clearly capable of some incredible things, which is why it\u2019s so incredibly valuable.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Wakandans will try to immediately upgrade the entire planet to the level of technology they enjoy; that would be a colossal undertaking, and not only am I not sure that makes sense for Wakanda, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even possible. What I do think will happen is that Wakanda will produce products for global consumption that, while largely similar to existing global technology, and as such are understandable and will work with current global infrastructure, will incorporate some amount of advanced Wakandan vibranum-based tech to make them better in some dramatic way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what I think the Wakandan car will be like: it\u2019ll be essentially recognizable as a car, in that it will have wheels that can use tires you can buy from any local tire store and you\u2019ll drive it and use it in essentially the same way we use cars now, but it will have a huge vibranium-related advantage. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m imagining this first Wakandan export market car, the Wakanda Motors Ingwe (that\u2019s Xhosa for \u2018panther\u2019 or \u2018puma\u2019) , will be:\n\nIt\u2019ll be a hybrid, fundamentally. But with a very crucial difference. Where the hybrids the rest of the world builds rely on heavy, inefficient chemical storage batteries, the Wakandan car will use the remarkable energy-absorbing and releasing power of vibranium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this power in action in Black Panther\u2019s suit, which has vibranium fibers woven into it. Black Panther gets shot with a bullet, for example, but instead of peeing himself and dying like most of us would, the suit not only stops the bullet, but absorbs the considerable kinetic energy from the bullet, stores it, and later releases it when Black Panther wants to do something like punch a truck through a building.\n\nThe WM Ingwe would use this kinetic energy-storage and release property of vibranium to replace the heavy batteries of a hybrid. By building the cars with an alloy of aluminum and vibranium for the main parts of the frame, and perhaps some of the main body panels, the Wakandan car would have a structure that\u2019s not just light and incredibly strong, but capable of storing vast amounts of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause vibranium has so far only been shown as something that can store and release energy, not generate it, we\u2019d still need to provide some initial source energy into the system. It may be possible to set up some sort of \u2018charging stations\u2019 which input energy into the vibranium frame of the car, allowing for a purely electric vehicle, but I was thinking it might be more useful for these cars to use a small internal combustion engine to act as an initial source of energy; It could be a fairly small motor, one liter or less, maybe something equivalent to one of the small three-cylinder motors being built by Ford, GM, Mitsubishi, BMW, whoever.\n\nMaybe this part will be sourced outside of Wakanda, or maybe some Wakandan researchers will have fun developing a tiny, powerful ICE engine of their own. It doesn\u2019t really matter. My guess is it would be a better PR move if they partnered with local companies to produce this part of the car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Actually, now that I think about it, probably the best move to keep from overly disrupting the global economy would be for them to just license the fundamental technology and provide the needed vibranium to companies all over the world. In that sense, think of the WM Ingwe as a sort of low-volume reference vehicle, with versions of the basic tech produced by established carmakers, under license.)\n\nThe ICE motor would get things started, turning gasoline or diesel into kinetic energy that would start \u2018charging\u2019 the vibranium frame, which would then provide power output to the main electric motor driving the rear axles. Let\u2019s say this is a Wakandan-designed motor, a scaled-down version of what they\u2019re already making for their trains or mining equipment or hover-ship windshield wipers. Based on their technological prowess with this stuff, I imagine this could be a pretty potent motor, certainly comparable to what Teslas use. Let\u2019s say it can produce a peak horsepower of 500, because why not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce in motion, the vibranium frame and body panels are collecting every bit of kinetic energy they encounter\u2014the molecules of air that hit the body of the car will transfer their kinetic energy to the system, the vibrations of the road, the motions of the passengers inside, along with more traditional energy reclamation systems like regenerative braking.\n\nHell, if the car was sitting for a while, and you forgot to put fuel in the ICE motor, you could probably get a good 10 or 20 miles of range by just pounding on the hood with your fists for a few minutes.\n\nVibranium has been shown to be incredibly effective at harvesting ambient kinetic energy; a few minutes of ICE-assisted driving would likely be enough to charge the vibranium up to the point where you could travel for 200 to 300 miles before needing to restart the gas engine\u2014perhaps more if it was windy, or if you, say, got caught in a rainstorm, with each raindrop adding a nice burst of energy to the car as it impacted the vibranium-alloy roof and hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat you\u2019d have, essentially, is a hybrid car without the biggest disadvantage of a hybrid: the heavy, inefficient battery. The vibranium frame and body panels would be both an incredibly strong and safe structure for the car as well as all the energy storage the car needs. You could shave hundreds and hundreds of pounds from cars, eliminate the difficult and environmentally troubling mining of resources like lithium, and never worry about finding a charging station or if your battery pack is going to degrade to uselessness after 10 years.\n\nWith a car like this, the Wakandans could make every Prius (and likely Tesla) on the road obsolete overnight. Wakandan vibranium technology has the potential to make incredibly efficient automobiles without sacrificing range or performance. I can\u2019t wait until we start seeing these things on the market\u2014you\u2019d have to be an idiot to buy anything that didn\u2019t use Wakandan vibranium-based tech.\n\nOh, shit, right.

These are dangerous times for those of us who live in CrazyTown. Let me explain.\n\n\n\nAbout eight years ago, I went to pick up my kid from day care. The clocks had been adjusted the night before, so I knew it would be getting darker, earlier.\n\nI went into her day care center at close to 4 p.m. She was having a meltdown. She needed her diaper changed. I had to go to the office to pay her tuition. It was one of those days where it took me practically an hour to get out of the place.\n\n\n\nIt was cold that day, but the sun had been bright and intense.\n\n\n\nI flung open the door, the baby in my arms, ready to head to the car.\n\n\n\nI was smacked in the face by complete and utter darkness. It was just after 5. And it looked like it was the middle of the night. I couldn\u2019t catch my breath. Something had reached down to my heart and squeezed it tight. Tears came up, and although I didn\u2019t know why, I knew I was about to start bawling.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the part I\u2019ve tried to explain to every therapist I\u2019ve had since that day.\n\nI knew I was about to be severely depressed. Like, starting that day, that exact moment. There was a switch somewhere inside. On = Mostly normal. Off = There\u2019s really no point to any of this.\n\n\n\nMy joint was officially locked and loaded into the off position, and I was severely depressed for the next three months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so began my hate-hate relationship with daylight saving time.\n\n\n\nFall and winter are not my friends. IT SHOULD NOT BE DARK AT 4:30!! Never, no, all wrong.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what I have to do. Your mileage may vary. Let me say that again. Your mileage may vary. Stay out of my DMs with your rants against modern medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Exercise\n\nI hate when people throw this out there as a treatment for depression. Just get up and get your blood flowing! Right. If it were that simple ...\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Exercise does work. Research shows that it can work as well as some of the leading antidepressants. I can\u2019t wait until now to get in the gym. If I haven\u2019t been exercising, it won\u2019t protect me immediately. And I\u2019m less likely to keep it up if I have to exercise at night. Two years ago, I started training for a 5K in the spring. I was still running regularly in the fall, and when it got dark in the afternoon, I barely noticed. I do believe exercise works. But it has to be a part of your daily regimen\u2014even when the sun sets late like it should.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Meds: Tweak Them. Yes, Meds\n\nIf you take antidepressants, you might need to tweak them during this time of year. If you are not on meds but you suspect thatyou might need to be, this could be a good time to talk to your doc. Take a questionnaire with a professional and see what happens. I think I may need a tweak this season. Tuesday\u2019s cold, rainy and dark situation was NOT OK. I\u2019m not gonna make changes because of one icky day. But I\u2019m keeping my eye on how I feel. I don\u2019t believe in under-medicating. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\n\n3. Escape Plan\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to skip town and be somewhere warm and sunny when the clock goes back. I finally did it. I put my pennies together, grabbed N.B. and spent the weekend eating conch salad in a bikini. I literally put my life on pause. Left my laptop at home. (First time in 19 years!!!) Told my kid I\u2019d see her in a few days. Kept the whole trip on a need-to-know basis. I woke up without an alarm clock. I ate what I wanted, when I wanted. (I discovered something I\u2019d never heard of called BurgerFi. Absolutely amazing.) Even though I came home to this cold and sunless nonsense, at least I also have warm memories and a suntan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Assemble the Troops\n\nThis is super important at this time of year. And this is also important to put in place before winter falls. Who is in your circle? Not just your overall family and friends. You need to have an intentionally curated group of folks who get it and get you. My friend Alex is my ground zero friend who knows how to get in touch with everyone else in the circle. If he calls and I say, \u201cHey,\u201d he knows exactly how to translate it.\n\nThen there\u2019s N.B. I\u2019m very grateful that this new person in my life is part of the circle. Even though I also hate it. Sometimes he stands over me and says, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving for work until you take your meds because you\u2019ll forget when I leave.\u201d I hate that. Because he\u2019s right. Of course my doctors are in the circle, and there is an extended circle of women I\u2019m connected to on social media who look out for me during this time of year as well. You get the point. Get your people together and keep them at the ready.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Everything Is Canceled\n\nWe here in CrazyTown must shut down. If you ask me to come to your wedding, bridal shower, gender reveal, whatever, the answer is no. I will get a gift. And stay put. Intermingling outside what is necessary is canceled. Get a mani-pedi instead. Steer clear of toxicity right now. Nudge some friends over that way. Avoid political conversations.\n\nMy dad passed away earlier this year, and it was around this time last year that he was in the hospital. He was a community activist, and when he passed, a local politician in our town sent a truly amazing tribute, recognizing a life of service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy baby sister noticed that this politician won in Tuesday night\u2019s election. So what does my sister do? She finds the message this woman sent and reads it. And rereads it. And reads it again. And is suddenly overwhelmed with grief. She calls me. We talk. And I gently remind her about the Awful Change From Day to Night. And she realizes how the time change also brought her to a dark place.\n\nReading wonderful things about Dad? No, ma\u2019am. This kind of activity is canceled until Valentine\u2019s Day!\n\nPlease cancel all the things until you feel like you\u2019ve gotten a handle on the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow what? Now we buckle down and get to work. Now we pray. (Yes, I believe in prayer. As long as it comes with my meds.) Now we breathe deep and stay in touch with our circle. Now we try to take a walk a few times a week. Even when we don\u2019t want to do it. Now we don\u2019t beat ourselves up if we skip the walk. Now we buy ourselves one thing we love just because.\n\n\n\nFor me, now I skip town. Again.\n\n\n\nI started looking for fares while on the flight home Tuesday. I found a flash sale to go right back to the sunshine. And the flight cost less than my weekly Starbucks budget.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWelp. No Thanksgiving leftovers for me.

I had no idea what to expect, but more important, I had no idea what to wear! I was going to a place where being a geek was highly encouraged\u2014and I couldn\u2019t contain my joy (retroactive shoutout to my dad and his girlfriend for dealing with 18-year-old me in the backseat of their car en route to the venue).\n\n\n\nIn the end, I decided on a Gundam Wing-themed ensemble that consisted of a mecha anime shirt and a rather stylish baseball cap. I\u2019d be the cutest black nerd that ever did nerd, and people could @ me all day about Gundam pilots ...\n\nThen I saw a dude walking down the street toward the convention dressed as Vash the Stampede.\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nSlick red coat. Cartoonishly spiky hair. Boots and a wicked pair of shades. It was as if he\u2019d stepped out of Trigun to take a stroll through Rosemont, Ill. Not to borrow from an all-too-common misconception, but I really did think it was a bit too early to be trick-or-treating. But there were entire groups of costumed people walking down the sidewalk, some dressed in geek apparel, while others wore meatball-headed wigs to portray champions of love and justice. I was equal parts confused and intrigued.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nAfter I got my badge and met up with my, ahem, \u201cfriend\u201d (now partner\u2014sorry, Dad), she explained what I was seeing. Attendees were participating in cosplay, which is when you emulate your favorite fictional characters by playing an elaborate game of dress-up. This ranges from replicating their most iconic outfits to doing variations of them in your own style. It\u2019s not exclusive to nerd culture, either, since pop-culture icons can be seen wandering the convention halls. Oh, and don\u2019t get me started on the costume crossovers. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen the Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders version of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Sephiroth and Cloud. (Google. It. Now.)\n\nPhoto: Steve B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the weekend ended, I immediately went on the hunt for characters I could cosplay. I searched all over the internet for a fat, black, queer female character I could bring to the next convention I went to. I\u2019m sure you let out a sad little laugh as you read that sentence. There aren\u2019t too many characters who fill those requirements today, let alone in 2002. But maybe I could take the \u201cqueer\u201d out, or even the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d if I was brave enough (spoiler: I wasn\u2019t). Eventually, I decided that cosplay wasn\u2019t for me and left the idea in my dorm room.\n\nThis is the story a lot of black cosplayers tell about the first time they decided to give cosplay a shot. Thankfully, many of us eventually say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and cosplay whomever we want. That\u2019s what I did in 2004. I was so into Yu Yu Hakusho that when a friend said they were cosplaying from it, I jumped at the chance to join them\u2014even though there wasn\u2019t a single character who looked like me.\n\nBut see, that\u2019s what cosplay is all about! You should cosplay whatever character you want\u2014and I do, all the time. I\u2019ll even alter a character\u2019s outfit and have my partner make it in a style that I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut damn, it\u2019d be nice to have options, you know? Canonical options that don\u2019t lead to being labeled the black version of a character. When you\u2019re forever on team #RepresentationMatters, you want to be able to look at a character roster and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nThe reality is that black cosplayers don\u2019t have as many candidates as our white counterparts. And yes, I see you typing that list of black characters in the comments, so let me fill you in on a little secret: We all have that list framed in our living rooms. It\u2019s part of the Black Cosplay Care Package (trademark pending), and it still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there\u2019s one black ranger in a team of five\u2014or six, depending on Tommy\u2019s mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we get excited when we see the likes of Black Lightning and Black Panther or hear news about an iconic character being reimagined as a black hero or heroine. We love Iron Man, but as soon as news broke that a black woman was going to wear the suit? We were on it in no time.\n\nImage: Mike McKone (Marvel Comics)\n\nYou know, there\u2019s this common thing new cosplayers do where they ask who they should cosplay based on their looks. My partner hates it because she feels you should look at the character you like, not worry about how accurately you can portray someone. But when you\u2019re a fat black girl, you kinda can\u2019t help searching for yourself\u2014and getting discouraged when you\u2019re not present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will always cosplay whatever character I\u2019m feeling at that moment, but I\u2019ll also always remember the 18-year-old me who felt so excluded from the group she wanted to be a part of. She\u2014and others like her\u2014deserve more options.\n\n", "keywords": ["options", "convention", "nerd", "character", "black", "youre", "cosplay", "nice", "28daysofblackcosplay", "thats", "characters", "wasnt"], "polarity": 0.12145721608408172, "subjectivity": 0.48781837565419656},

I\u2019m in town to attend The Root 100 gala Thursday night, but I\u2019m here early to meet with my agent (and possibly my editor), hang out with some friends and visit the GMG office.\n\nI flew here from San Francisco after speaking at Stanford University on Monday evening. Their African and African American Studies program invited Panama and me out there, and we spent 90 minutes talking about everything from Beyonc\u00e9 and bacon to sugar on grits and the surreality of getting paid for basically being a professional black person.\n\nThis time last week I was in Kentucky sharing an audience with bell hooks. And in the coming weeks I\u2019ll be speaking at Morgan State (my first HBCU) and reading a piece I wrote for \u201c20/20\u201d\u2014a collaboration between the Carnegie Museum of Art and the the Studio Museum in Harlem. (Also, I learned last week that I was named to Ebony magazine\u2019s 2017 Power 100\u2014an honor I greatly appreciate but have some ambivalence about, for obvious reasons.)\n\nAnd this is just November. Each month in the past year has mirrored what\u2019s happening this month. This has been, without a doubt, the best year of my professional life. And it happened\u2014and is happening\u2014during the Trump presidency, and this makes it all feel ... fake.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my lifetime, there has never been an American president and an administration and an America more openly antagonistic toward people who happen to look like me. Of course, racism didn\u2019t end with Barack Obama and didn\u2019t start again with Donald Trump. What exists now has existed as long as America has. But at least they attempted to spray some Febreze on it.\n\nNow there\u2019s not even a courtesy flush. No effort to disguise what\u2019s happening, and no intention of pandering to anyone except those who believe we\u2019re undeserving of full citizenship. And the juxtaposition between what\u2019s happening in America and what\u2019s happening in my American life is so stark that it feels counterfeit.\n\nImposter syndrome describes the feeling of believing that your accomplishments are invalid and that you\u2019ll eventually be revealed to be a fraud. But what about when you believe that your accomplishments are valid as a motherfucker, but you can\u2019t feel great about them because they\u2019re happening at the exact-same fucking time the president has declared war on niggas who look like you? Surreal doesn\u2019t even capture that feeling because surreal still feels real. This feels like I\u2019m watching my own episode of Punk\u2019d\u2014while it\u2019s happening to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis m\u00e9lange of unsettledness and anxiety may be the reason that this has also been the least healthy year I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve seen more doctors this year than I have in the last 10 years combined. My acid reflux has gone from manageable to perpetually annoying. I sleep maybe five hours a day. Five-and-a-half if I\u2019m really tired. I had a random sciatic nerve issue in January that made sitting (sitting!) an act of masochism, a sinus-pressure-causing earache that made me feel like a lit M-80 was sitting in my skull and perpetual congestion. Oh, and I kinda sorta thought I almost died.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m nearing 40. And the older you get, the more weird and random shit starts happening to your body. Also, although my soon-to-be-2-year-old daughter is awesome and amazing and everything that is great about life, she\u2019s basically a bag of salmonella. But it can\u2019t be a coincidence that this is happening during this year of Trump-related existential dread\u2014of feeling even more isolated and unwelcome and surrounded by them. Donald Trump is literally making me sick.\n\nIn turn, this stress has made my work a bit meaner and less forgiving\u2014particularly in regard to race and white people. For instance, a glance through the race-related pieces I wrote in 2015 and early 2016 shows work that was either (half) jokingly admonishing whiteness (i.e., \u201cDear White People: Donald Trump Is Happening Because You\u2019re Scared of Black People, so Don\u2019t Be!\u201d and \u201cDear White People: Here\u2019s 10 Ways to Tell if a Black Person Actually Likes You\u201d) or hard on a particular white person (i.e., \u201cWhy \u2018Well-Meaning\u2019 White People Like WTAE-TV\u2019s Wendy Bell, the White-Privilege Turducken, Are the Worst\u201d) or a particular type of white person (\u201cWhy Conservatives Are So Upset About President Obama\u2019s Photo in Front of a Che Guevara Mural, Explained\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow? It\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Tired of Good White People.\u201d And \u201cI Don\u2019t Give a Damn About Unity.\u201d And \u201cWe Need a Reset Button or Something for White People.\u201d And \u201cI Want Trump Supporters to Lose Badly and Go and Fucking Die.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this shift in language and sentiment would have happened organically. The feelings I\u2019m articulating now aren\u2019t exactly wrong. But Trump has exacerbated this change. He\u2019s been a caveat and qualifier remover. Which, I believe, has been good for my writing. But sometimes it makes me feel fucking yucky. Because, well, I can\u2019t discount the possibility that Trump\u2019s infamously abrasive way of communicating has subconsciously influenced mine.\n\nI\u2019m a different person than I was a year ago. And some of these changes\u2014metaphysical and literal\u2014are directly related to what happened a year ago today.

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["takes", "work", "woolleywilson", "girls", "black", "math", "tech", "need", "leadership", "world", "stem", "jessie", "raise", "women", "shuris", "young"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

On Monday we woke up to one of the most horrific mass shootings in American history. On Tuesday we saw the guy some call the president of the United States visit the hurricane-ravaged American territory Puerto Rico for nothing more than a photo op and to practice his jumper with rolls of paper towels. On Wednesday, Cam Newton, a former NFL MVP, laughed at a reporter because he thought it was funny to hear a \u201cfemale\u201d talk about wide receiver routes. And by Thursday, we found out that said reporter used to be one of those white women who like to use the word \u201cnigga.\u201d\n\nIf you were extra woke, you probably even heard about retired NBA basketball player Kenyon Martin accusing Jeremy Lin of wanting to be black for getting dreadlocks and then Lin executing what is the equivalent of an in-game dunk by telling Martin he appreciates locs the way Martin appreciates Chinese tattoos.\n\n\n\nAdd up all this news, and you know what you get? Enough knowledge to do well on a round of Wait Wait ... Don\u2019t Tell Me! and be the most woke person at a dinner party. But wouldn\u2019t it be better if you were the most awake person at a dinner party?\n\nAt some point in our adult lives, the most common response we get to the \u201cHow are you?\u201d question is some variation of \u201cTired.\u201d And the ironic thing is, people say it like it\u2019s a badge of honor. Folks these days are too proud to be tired and too ashamed to be rested, and it makes no damn sense.\n\nI will admit: When I was younger, I hated naps. I was one of those people raised on hip-hop and thus lived by the motto \u201cSleep is the cousin of death.\u201d But as I got older, it became clear to me that I wasn\u2019t a rapper; I am my mother\u2019s son, and I needed to take heed to the advice she used to give me growing up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack when I was a kid getting all riled up over something like my Nintendo cartridges not working, she would say, \u201cGo take a nap.\u201d Any ill feeling I complained to her about: \u201cGo take a nap.\u201d A little bit of heartbreak or sadness over some girl who didn\u2019t like me back or some kid who made fun of me: \u201cGo take a nap.\u201d When I was a child, that didn\u2019t sound like advice; it sounded like an order; but in hindsight, I realized what my mom was trying to do: She was trying to put me at ease. Sleep may be the cousin of death, but it\u2019s the sibling of peace of mind.\n\n\n\nSo how do we do this nap thing? Fuck if I know, but I\u2019ll at least try to be of some help here.\n\n\n\nNot all of us have jobs that allow us to take naps, but most of us have a break here and there, and in that time, you need to be relentless with this nap thing. This starts with space. One of the reasons we don\u2019t take naps is that we overthink what a nap looks like. We think it needs to be this comfortable, sound sleep, but the truth is that a real nap is always a little uncomfortable. You don\u2019t need to lay down to close your eyes\u2014all you need is to find a place where nobody can see you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, space for a nap is one thing, but time? Time runs us way more than we run time, but we need to live by the words of our spiritual Auntie Maxine Waters and reclaim a little bit of time for ourselves by taking a nap. And when I say \u201ca little bit,\u201d I do mean a little bit. More naps is not the same as more sleep.\n\nNaps are like sex: They don\u2019t need to be long to be good. Got a 30-minute lunch break? Eat for 15 minutes, close your eyes for the other 15. Got a 15-minute break? Give yourself five to 10 minutes to close your eyes. Whatever the length of time is, just remember: Most people do not care where you are at or what you are doing for a small amount of time, so why not use that to your advantage? Take a nap.\n\nAnd if you need further convincing that naps are not only good for you but also not bad for you, allow me to be an example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2011 I was a staff writer at the Huffington Post. One of the coolest things we had there was nap rooms. Yep, that\u2019s right: We had actual rooms built for the sole purpose of taking naps. Arianna Huffington believed strongly in the idea that a quick nap can revive us as much as a cup of coffee or walk around the block.\n\nAs cool as it was to have these nap rooms, I called them trap rooms. I was a young journalist of color working on the Black Voices vertical. I would be damned if I represented myself as anything less than a hardworking reporter. Fuck a nap, I said to myself. I was there to work, and work I did.\n\nBut about six months into the job, I was blindsided by my editor, who said she was letting me go simply because I wasn\u2019t a good fit. I worked hard. I showed up to work every day on time and I never missed deadlines. She simply didn\u2019t think my work aligned with the vision she had for the site. That\u2019s all water under the bridge now, but I still think about those nap rooms and how naive I was to think that if I got caught in one of them, I would be judged unfairly. As it turns out, it wasn\u2019t a nap that got me fired\u2014it was work.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week has been a lot, but in 2017, what week hasn\u2019t been? Every week there\u2019s more news, more things for us to worry about, and it\u2019s all so exhausting. We talk about things like unplugging and self-care, but what do those things mean? A nap, on the other hand, is absolute. It doesn\u2019t have to be every day, it doesn\u2019t have to be every week. You should just be taking more naps than you have been taking, which is probably zero.\n\nIt may not be the cure to all your problems, but nobody has ever woken up from a nap and regretted it. Naps also may not be cool. People will try to tell you that when you\u2019re on your deathbed, you won\u2019t look back and wish you\u2019d taken more naps, but those people will also probably die before you, so don\u2019t listen to them. Listen to yourself, and the next time you\u2019re exhausted or weary with the world or work, find some space and find some time to take a nap.\n\n", "keywords": ["nap", "work", "needs", "naps", "rooms", "need", "week", "dont", "things", "little", "think"], "polarity": 0.07240499013458195, "subjectivity": 0.46510770975056676},

Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays his wife, won the best actress in a comedy series Golden Globe for her role.\n\nThree-fourths of the viewers are nonblack for Secrets and Lies, the ABC crime drama that revolves around the biracial heir (Michael Ealy) to a Charlotte, N.C., equity firm and the murder of his wife.\n\nABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder is the Shonda Rhimes hit drama starring Academy Award winner Viola Davis as a criminal-defense professor who gets entangled in a murder plot. Sixty-nine percent of the show\u2019s viewership is nonblack.\n\nSixty-eight percent of viewership is nonblack for ABC\u2019s Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes \u201cShondaLand\u201d thriller featuring Kerry Washington as a media consultant to the president.\n\nWith 63 percent nonblack viewers, Fox\u2019s Pitch is a dramedy about the first woman, a black woman, to play baseball in the Major Leagues.\n\nInsecure is the HBO original comedy series co-created by Golden Globe-nominated Issa Rae. Inspired by Rae\u2019s popular web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, viewership is 61 percent nonblack.\n\nHalf of viewership for the newcomer Atlanta is nonblack. The show, a Golden Globe-winning comedy-drama on FX created by and starring Donald Glover, centers on two black cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the tone of this study, one is supposed to find this encouraging.\n\n\n\nIndeed, of its findings, Andrew McCaskill, senior vice president, communications and multicultural marketing at Nielsen, says:\n\n\n\nMuch of the American narrative lately has focused on a growing cultural divide. But Nielsen\u2019s data on television programming show something different. Storylines with a strong black character or identity are crossing cultural boundaries to grab diverse audiences and start conversations. That insight is important for culture and content creators, as well as manufacturers and retailers looking to create engaging, high-impact advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRespectfully, presenting data that reveals that black-led television shows have crossover appeal is akin to other earth-shattering news like Popeyes biscuits taste like heaven in your mouth, there\u2019s nothing like being debt-free and dick too bomb.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely revealing about this information. The same goes for the study\u2019s noting that shows with a majority-black audience, like Empire, can manage to still \u201cpropel a show to Emmy-nominated, award-winning mainstream success.\u201d\n\nYes, Taraji P. Henson is a Golden Globe-winning, Emmy-nominated actress thanks to her role as Cookie Lyon on Empire, but you know who long ago met this feat? Jack\u00e9e Harry, who remains the first and only black woman to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She won for her role as the original Instagram model Sandra Clark on 227. 227 was a show about working-class Negroes in Washington, D.C., before the white folks took over and put bike lanes on Georgia Avenue near Howard University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo am I supposed to be thrilled about this news that could easily have been packaged with the hashtags of #TBT or #FBF? Sorry, Nielsen, but I do decline. To be fair, Nielsen does note that television shows such as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son and The Cosby Show had already proved that our shows can be watched by all. Even so, Nielsen offers the addendum: \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual now is the sheer number of such programs that are carrying cross-cultural appeal.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t much \u2019bout al-ge-bra, but I do know if a few black shows can claim crossover appeal, an increased volume ought to yield a similar result. Us black folks are pretty diverse, don\u2019t ya know? I mean, clearly America had Negro fatigue, as evidenced by that new man in the White House, but if The Cosby Show and A Different World could thrive as trifling Ronald Reagan hollered about welfare queens and crack, Issa Rae, Donald Glover, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis can maintain success under Minute Maid Mao\u2019s mismanaged terrorist reign.\n\nSo, now that we know that the truth of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s is true in the 2010s, what will networks do about it? Will they continue to be more inclusive in their background? They could. After all, it would be nice to see more visibility in terms of class, gender and sexual orientation. We may be seeing more of us on television, but it\u2019s still not all of us. Maybe networks will finally embrace a stubborn reality and keep a great thing going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr they could follow their previous pattern of seeing our value and casting it aside anyway. In some respects, you already see that. Go ask Tamron Hall. Go ask anyone black who tried to launch a successful television show in the late 1990s or 2000s.\n\n\n\nI want to be hopeful because hope is all we have. However, while others celebrated this survey, I found it largely inconsequential. Those majority-white executives have always known that black people and black culture can reach all. It is a debate that has long been settled.\n\n\n\nAgain, the question is not can we be appreciated by all, but when will our value finally be acknowledged, accepted and, mostly, continuously invested in? Then we can ask about a proper Girlfriends series finale or full-out reunion because Joan and Toni not reuniting before the conclusion was some bullshit. Consider that a part of the reparations backstage, white people.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "appeal", "know", "nonblack", "shows", "golden", "black", "viewership", "tv", "crossover", "television", "treatment", "sidepiece", "blackled", "nielsen", "series"], "polarity": 0.1290927822177822, "subjectivity": 0.48281041874791863},

Brown (Getty Images)\n\nDear Mr. Barris:\n\nI bring you greetings from Dem Cut Boyz barbershop in Birmingham, Ala. where the honorable Lamont Brinson is my barber. I send this letter after a delegation from my haircuttery elected me to speak on their behalf, and presumably, for all of our people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesterday, during our busiest time of the day, we hosted a discussion about the recent Variety article revealing that the February 27 installment of Black-ish entitled \u201cPlease, Baby, Please\u201d had been shelved and replaced with a re-run. According to the report, the episode was canned because it dealt with the NFL kneeling issue and other political and social issues. We wanted to speak directly to you, Mr. Barris, because you are the creator of the show.\n\nWhen we read that the episode featured Anthony Anderson\u2019s character Dre, telling a bedtime story about his fears and concerns over the state of the country, we all agreed that it was a brilliant idea. We all realize we that America can only accept black truths if the revelations are embedded in dream sequences, superhero movie overtones or set to a beat that causes Caucasians to dance. (And you know you can\u2019t get dudes at a barbershop to agree on anything. In June 2016, while getting my beard trimmed, I argued that Serena Williams is the greatest athlete of all time\u2014male or female\u2014and they were still debating it yesterday.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told a thousand times that Black-ish is one of the only shows ever on network television to capture the sentiment of Black America. The \u201cFreedom\u201d musical episode was one of the highest-rated episodes ever on TV according to the Nielsen ratings. (Jerome Nielsen is one of the barbers here. Every time someone mentions Black-ish, he plays The Roots\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Just a Slave\u201d song on the boom box beside his barber chair.)\n\nAfter an emergency meeting using Roberts Rules of Order (Robert is one of our barbers who a struggles with the bald fade, but he keeps very good order) we passed a motion passed to ask you for one favor:\n\nYou have to leak the episode, bruh.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know that any request punctuated with the word \u201cbruh\u201d is very serious. We even took into account your quote in the article when you said: \u201cGiven our creative differences, neither ABC nor I were happy with the direction of the episode and mutually agreed not to air it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you directed the episode and the show is one of the highest-rated and most awarded comedies on network television, we know that \u201cmutually agreed,\u201d in black parlance, means: \u201cThese white folks made the decision,\u201d We mutually agreed to pick cotton for 400 years. We \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to Jim Crow. We \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to systematic inequality. We are tired of mutual agreements.\n\nWe are not asking you to do anything illegal or even immoral. We would never ask you to violate your contract because we need more seasons of Black-ish.\n\nAs such, here is our offer:\n\nDem Cut Boyz barbershop offers free haircuts for life to Mr. Kenya Barris. During one of your appointments, I predict that you will fall asleep during a hot shave. Somehow, LaTrice Briscoe\u2019s bad-ass son, Deonte, will somehow \u201cfind\u201d the DVD or flash drive with the \u201cPlease, Baby, Please\u201d episode in your pocket. (Trust me, lil\u2019 Deonte is good at finding shit in people\u2019s pockets.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe episode will somehow end up being uploaded to YouTube, Facebook and Black America\u2019s favorite streaming service: World Star Hip Hop. I\u2019m not saying this was planned. I\u2019m just saying...\n\nWe know that ABC is owned by Disney, which makes them very sensitive to public sentiment. We also understand that, as a partner of the NFL, they don\u2019t like criticism of the National Football League. But this is your path to becoming an immortal legend and earning the title bestowed upon some of the all-time greats whose names are prefaced with the honorific: \u201cMy nigga.\u201d\n\nOur plan offers plausible deniability to both you and the network, and the leaked episode going viral could lead to an increase in ratings. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe make this offer with no strings attached and hope you will consider our proposal. If not, we will still watch Black-ish with the same loyal admiration knowing that you were unable to comply because of your \u201cmutual agreement.\u201d\n\nSincerely,\n\nDem Cut Boyz", "keywords": ["kenya", "blackish", "barris", "letter", "mutually", "know", "mr", "im", "cut", "black", "banned", "begging", "agreed", "leak", "open", "network", "episode"], "polarity": 0.18004065040650402, "subjectivity": 0.5725474254742549},

He danced around what sounded to me like depression. Without actually using the D-word, he talked about having a hard time getting out of bed, feeling sad for no reason and just wondering if it was worth going on.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been there. And I was super concerned about him. But I didn\u2019t feel it was my place to slide into his DMs when I didn\u2019t know him. I decided to check on the comments and hope that he got some good advice from his Facebook family.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what folks suggested:\n\n\n\nWhen you feel like you don\u2019t want to get up, get up anyway and you\u2019ll feel better.\n\nTry to at least get up for church and let the blood of Jesus wash away Satan\u2019s hold on you.\n\nCut out all dairy products from your diet. You\u2019ll feel better immediately. (TWO people posted that.)\n\nJoin a sport.\n\nTake St. John\u2019s-wort!\n\n\n\nThis went on for 20 comments. I cried. And then I said curse words to these nameless, faceless people who I knew were just trying to help him.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s what he needs: therapy and meds.\n\n\n\nLet me say it one more time: therapy and meds.\n\n\n\nI know I don\u2019t know him or his life. And I know that the blood of Jesus may indeed be miraculous. I know playing a sport helps with endorphins. But if this man is definitely clinically depressed, he needs two things first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherapy. Meds.\n\n\n\nHow do I know? Well, because this is my life and that\u2019s what I need. Now, many would say, well, that\u2019s just your life. That is true; your mileage may vary. But for the most part, here\u2019s how this works.\n\n\n\nDealing with depression (and all mental-health issues) is like having a broken leg. You need a doctor and a cast right away when you break your leg. We all agree on that, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould a pair of crutches help? Yes.\n\nCan it replace a doctor and a cast? No.\n\nCan you ignore the fact that your leg is broken and get up and walk it off? No.\n\nCan you change your diet and heal your leg? No.\n\nCan you fix your leg alone with no medical attention? No.\n\nShould you wait it out and see if your leg heals on its own?\n\n\n\nYou see where I\u2019m going with this.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen posts like this, and I always feel steam coming out of my ears. But I rarely comment\u2014even when it\u2019s someone I know. I feel like it\u2019s not my business, and more importantly\u2014I wasn\u2019t ready to out myself as someone who deals with mental-health issues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth is (takes a deep breath), I\u2019m a proud resident of Crazytown. And have been for years.\n\n\n\n(Around the world, people are reading and nodding like, oh! Now that makes sense!)\n\n\n\nSo this is the paragraph where I break down my mental-health story\u2014which begins in 1986 and continues into this very moment. It\u2019s super juicy (and often devastatingly sad). But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessary\u2014just yet.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe basics: I was diagnosed with lots of fun labels around 2009. I didn\u2019t figure it out and get it under control (if there is such a thing) until Feb. 22, 2017.\n\n\n\nEight years.\n\n\n\nEight years of (mostly) crappy doctors, awful medications, and family and friends who just didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhenever I tried to talk to people I trusted, I often got suggestions like giving up dairy (I\u2019m still pissed at that friend, although I know he meant well) and working out more or joining the church.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m extremely type A with a healthy dose of OCD. I am the queen of Get Things Done. So what frustrated me most over the years was that living in Crazytown was not something I could research and conquer on my own.\n\n\n\nExample: In 2004 I realized I had somehow moved to DrinkyTown. I needed to stop drinking. I did my homework. Found a local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in my area. Listened to what they had to say. Go to 90 meetings in 90 days? Jeesh. OK. I\u2019ll do it. Get a sponsor? I don\u2019t like these people. But all right, cool. I\u2019ll get one. Read these books and pamphlets? Done. The place kind of felt like a freaking cult. But it was working. Thirteen years later, I\u2019m still here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you realize you live in DrinkyTown, you\u2019ll find a whole community of folks to get you all settled in. And they will invite you over for weak coffee and stale cookies every single day.\n\nBut living in Crazytown doesn\u2019t work that way. You go to a doctor who asks you a bunch of questions, gives you a prescription and you\u2019re on your own. You don\u2019t get a sponsor that you can call every single day and have meetings all over the world you can drop into if things are getting tough.\n\n\n\nYou have to find the right doctors, the right books and the right treatment program\u2014and be ready to switch it all up if you need to. It\u2019s draining. It\u2019s expensive. And if you\u2019re symptomatic\u2014it\u2019s impossible. How the hell are you supposed to figure out how to pull yourself up out of depression if you\u2019re depressed? How do you pull yourself down from mania if you\u2019re manic?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I managed to figure out my own system. I sat down with a new psychiatrist for the billionth time. As soon as we started to talk, I felt like he might be the one. I showed him the meds I was on and he immediately pointed out some issues that had been concerning me, too. Me and new doc vibed. And we\u2019re still going strong. (Much more on that later.)\n\n\n\nI\u2019m very proud of many things in my life. I made the New York Times best-seller list with my very first book. I have had a storied career in journalism over the past 19 years. I took on motherhood (and stepmotherhood) like a freaking boss. I looked at my 20-something drunken-hot-mess self and said, nah, girl. You gotta chill. Let\u2019s work this out. And I did. For everything from Newports to Louisiana crunch cake, I know how to look my vices in the face and shut them down. I know how to look my goals in the face and make them happen.\n\n\n\nBut there is nothing\u2014and I mean nothing\u2014I am more proud of than how I have conquered three decades of mental-health shit. Of course, conquered doesn\u2019t mean cured. Which is why I am on my therapist\u2019s couch every Tuesday at 12:30.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019s here. And I\u2019m going to use this space to talk about how I got to the top of the Rocky steps, running in circles and shaking my fists with a bottle of lithium in each hand. (That lithium, I tell you \u2026 it\u2019s a helluva drug.)\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be writing for the Facebook guy who needed help that day. And for every single person I\u2019ve seen struggling with the same things. I\u2019ll be sharing what\u2019s been working for me. Through all of the super-tough side effects, the frustrating therapy sessions, the expensive copays\u2014all of it.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m living in Crazytown on that proverbial broken leg\u2014with a cast and crutches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I didn\u2019t even have to give up dairy.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "pills", "comingout", "battle", "im", "mentalhealth", "defeat", "youre", "didnt", "therapy", "things", "leg", "right", "feel", "dont", "depression", "necessary"], "polarity": 0.11630348428101236, "subjectivity": 0.5293221135917766},

Jordan. The exploits of the movie\u2019s title hero (Chadwick Boseman) and various members of his team are also throughly, lovingly captured by director and co-writer Ryan Coogler. But something does happen whenever the movie cuts over to Jordan\u2019s Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d Stevens: The scenes snap Coogler, and by extension his audience, out of the usual Marvel Cinematic Universe reverie of affection and amusement, bringing them to sharper attention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be unique to an MCU project, but it\u2019s not that unusual for Coogler\u2019s films, in part because he\u2019s a terrific filmmaker, and maybe also because all three of them\u2014Black Panther, Creed, and Fruitvale Station\u2014feature Jordan. It\u2019s not just a case of the camera loving Jordan, though he does have some of that innate star quality. Coogler seems especially fascinated by the actor\u2019s confidence\u2014his lack of obvious attempts to ingratiate himself\u2014and how that can transform the material he\u2019s given.\n\nAnd Jordan does help transform his material. None of his movies with Coogler are exactly unpredictable in terms of pure plot. This is even true of the groundbreaking Black Panther. On paper, Jordan\u2019s Erik follows an arc familiar to the MCU: He shares a semi-secret history with the film\u2019s costumed protagonist, spends his early scenes isolated from the other main characters as he gathers his resources and prepares to surprise the hero, and is pitted against that hero in a battle in which he functions as a mirror image, even donning his own panther-like supersuit.\n\nYet by handing this Marvel boilerplate over to Jordan, Coogler turns a well-worn structure into an affecting strategy. Erik\u2019s backstory, revealed well into the film, depends on his being left behind by the futuristic but closed-off country of Wakanda, abandoned in Coogler\u2019s hometown of Oakland following the death of his revolutionary father. He\u2019s one of the weightiest MCU villains, but Jordan doesn\u2019t charge straight into operatic intensity or even normal scenery-chewing. While most of the Wakanda characters speak in African-accented English that sounds regal and precise, Erik has a more colloquial American style, in which Jordan finds a wry musicality. His understated greeting of \u201cHey, auntie,\u201d directed at Wakandan royalty Ramonda (Angela Bassett), has a cultural specificity lacking from the MCU\u2019s easier laugh lines, and a human dimension sorely lacking from, say, the Red Skull. Jordan\u2019s performance depends on these small gestures, like when Erik addresses his Wakandan associates from the throne and taps his finger to betray a nervous energy behind his authority. Most supervillain performances play, with an understandable theatricality, to the audience. Jordan\u2019s speech patterns and little gestures are more self-possessed.\n\nPhoto: Black Panther (Marvel Studios/Disney)\n\nCoogler uses his gift for imagery to support Jordan\u2019s actorly choices, like the scene in which Erik approaches the Wakanda border with a crucial dead body in tow. This brief moment has a texture often lacking in comics movies, a kind of magic-hour idyll that nonetheless depicts an angry revolutionary carting around a corpse. Coogler also employs one of his favorite cinematic devices, the following shot, in which the camera pursues its subject. Killmonger isn\u2019t the only one who gets this treatment; Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa has one of his own as he approaches his crowning ceremony. But the most striking version in the movie stays on Killmonger\u2019s back, not Black Panther\u2019s. As Erik assumes the Wakandan throne, the camera begins upside down and makes a full, deliberate 180-degree turn, both a stylish image and a crystallization of the moment when Killmonger transitions from angry outsider to the man in charge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan\u2019s willingness to be still, and explode with emotion when needed, seem to embolden Coogler\u2019s nervier instincts. This was the case before Black Panther, when Coogler made another franchise movie that gave him even more stylistic flexibility. Creed, in which Jordan plays the illegitimate son of Rocky Balboa\u2019s opponent-turned-buddy Apollo Creed, isn\u2019t building an expansion on an expensive, elaborate, ongoing piece of Marvel architecture, but working off of a series bible written mostly (and haphazardly) by Rocky star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone. This allows Coogler and Jordan to reshape the material and make the best Rocky movie since the first one.\n\nCreed doesn\u2019t give Jordan a lot of dialogue upfront. Adonis Creed\u2019s first lines in the movie are spoken by an actor playing him as a kid, and he\u2019s first seen as an adult getting himself psyched up for a fight before the camera follows him up some stairs, mostly in shadow, and into the boxing ring. Other early scenes, all providing the character with degrees of standoffishness, rely on his seething intensity\u2014and accompanying sense of isolation. Even his first conversation with his love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), gets abruptly curtailed as she slams a door in his face.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat, subtle trick Coogler plays to maintain Creed\u2019s underdog status despite what appears to be a more privileged background than Balboa. The fact that Jordan\u2019s ultra-persistent Creed doesn\u2019t replicate the aw-shucks humility of Rocky counts as a bold gambit in a big-studio environment that demands selfless gestures, cardboard villains, children in peril\u2026 anything to score some more precious likability. Creed works so well because Jordan spends so little time asking for approval, which gives his late-movie mid-fight admission to Balboa, that he\u2019s fighting to prove that he\u2019s not a \u201cmistake,\u201d the force of a major body blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Creed\u2019s boxing legacy, the movie succeeds in keeping its characters at ground level, which Coogler emphasizes with more following shots. Some of them have a traditional boxer-into-the-ring iconic grandeur, while others, like Creed\u2019s entrance into Bianca\u2019s apartment, are more intimate, bringing the audience along with the character rather than staring in awe at his majesty. There\u2019s a similar sense of intimacy in the sequence when Coogler follows Jordan and Stallone together from a Philadelphia street, up some stairs, and around the floor of a boxing gym, simply because after a lot of scenes that isolate Jordan, the two stars share the frame for nearly the entire length of the unbroken shot.\n\nAlthough both Creed and Panther have a broader visual vocabulary, it\u2019s their following shots that forge the strongest visual connections between the earliest, least flashy Coogler/Jordan collaboration. Fruitvale Station, a dramatization of the 24 hours leading up to the real-life police shooting of Oscar Grant III, an unarmed Bay Area resident, packs a clear emotional punch, and its relevance sadly hasn\u2019t faded at all since its 2013 release. In the context of Coogler\u2019s career, though, it feels like an extremely promising tryout. Plenty of filmmakers\u2014hopefully most\u2014improve after their first film, but it\u2019s rare to find a director who can follow a Sundance indie with two straight franchise movies and have the franchise movies feel more personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Fruitvale, Coogler and Jordan haven\u2019t come to experiment or dazzle. Stylewise, the movie stays within contemporary American indie aesthetics, with lots of handheld camera and plainspoken realism (sort of Gus Van Sant lite). Jordan talks more, with a slightly Casey Affleck-ish rasp, and spells out more of his character\u2019s feelings. Most of the movie\u2019s stylistic flourishes are accordingly less sustained, part of its slice-of-life approach: Coogler\u2019s camera follows Oscar into his bedroom as he hastily cleans up and grabs some marijuana that he intends to sell; down the greeting card aisle of a store; and with handheld jitteriness as he approaches the canine victim of a hit-and-run.\n\nBut there are also distinctive if still unshowy stretches: one following shot of Oscar as he walks through his daughter\u2019s school, leading seamlessly into a brief scene with his daughter on the school\u2019s backyard playground, and another that travels with him and his friends up the escalator out of the BART system and onto the streets of San Francisco. The camera isn\u2019t constantly at Jordan\u2019s back but it scarcely lets him out of its sight\u2014a queasily effective strategy given Oscar\u2019s tragic end.\n\nThat coiled quality of waiting for a vicious inevitability lies more with the story of Fruitvale than Jordan\u2019s performance; the real-life events take over and can\u2019t provide the emotional release of an extremely fictional crowd-pleaser like Black Panther or Creed. But Jordan does get to show tremendous range of the everyday-life variety: warmth with his daughter, frustration with his limited job options, guilt over lying to his mom about using a cellphone earpiece while he drives, sly charm in a scene where he talks a shop owner into letting a couple of women in to use the bathroom. That this character\u2019s reality extends to a terrifying and violent police stop makes the movie chilling, and Jordan keeps it from feeling too much like a pure exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is in almost every single scene of Fruitvale, most of the scenes in Creed, and comparatively fewer in Black Panther. This progression would make it seem like Coogler is weaning himself off of his muse, if not for the fact that Jordan\u2019s potency only increases as their collaboration goes on. He commands the screen in Fruitvale, emerges as a real movie star in Creed, and by Black Panther does so much with his half hour or so of screen time that his presence looms over the whole movie despite barely appearing in it for the first hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the single most affecting scene of Black Panther, Coogler holds back his star, trusting him to deliver in small doses. During a dream sequence, Erik speaks to his departed father (Sterling K. Brown), and in a single cut, Coogler brings Erik back to the pre-teen age he was when his dad was killed. Their interaction continues without missing a beat, and when he cuts back to the adult Erik, still in the dream, a tear streaming down Jordan\u2019s cheek, the scared, angry kid of seconds earlier is still there in Jordan\u2019s eyes. Inserting a kid actor into the scene could come off like a filmmaking shortcut, a way to wring emotion out of the scene faster. But it works beautifully because Coogler trusts Jordan to create continuity with those shots of his character\u2019s younger self. The scene has a recognizably real-world sense of tragedy with few, if any, equals in the MCU.\n\nThis carries over into the film\u2019s action climax. As they fight for Wakanda\u2019s fate, Erik and T\u2019Challa are forcefully separated by a vibranium-powered subway that temporarily de-powers their supersuits (Star Wars diehards may recall a similar physical setup in a Phantom Menace duel). Coogler uses the strategic halt in action as an opportunity for Erik to expose his pain, his sense that the world has taken everything from him, an outburst not unlike Creed\u2019s moment of ringside catharsis. Excitingly staged fisticuffs pause for sustained heartbreak. Black Panther has some Marvel limitations, but Coogler seems excited to readjust pop touchstones while pushing Jordan to the fore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan and Coogler are both extremely talented, and will doubtlessly do great work apart. (A fourth collaboration between the two, the test-cheating drama Wrong Answer, has already been announced). Their work together so far, though, feels emboldened like the best star/filmmaker collaborations. In this case, Jordan and Coogler have been able to address aspects of being black in America in all of their movies in pretty disparate genres. Other filmmakers have treated Jordan like a more traditional star. In his movies without Coogler, including two other superhero pictures from now-disgraced director Josh Trank (the found-footage Chronicle and the most recent attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four), he\u2019s still charismatic. But his material leans heavily on that charisma, rather than pushing it beyond movie-star likability. Chronicle seems to at least understand his magnetism, but Fantastic Four strands him and the rest of the cast, while his single foray into comedy, That Awkward Moment, burdens him with the movie\u2019s most serious subplot (though he\u2019s not any worse off than the cast members who have to labor under the impression that their antics are amusing).\n\nAs Jordan becomes more famous, presumably other filmmakers will figure out how to use him more effectively and consistently. But right now it\u2019s hard to imagine another director matching the thrill of Coogler and Jordan getting on each other\u2019s wavelength, modulating big stylistic leaps with subtler performance notes (and, when necessary, vice versa), digging beyond the surface pleasures of their talents. Their collective gravity brings even the biggest movies down to earth.", "keywords": ["goes", "jordan", "coogler", "b", "gameraising", "movie", "erik", "black", "panther", "creed", "partnership", "scene", "movies", "ryan", "michael", "jordans"], "polarity": 0.09555645743145742, "subjectivity": 0.4853012265512266},

Brown (Getty Images)\n\nDear Mr. Barris:\n\nI bring you greetings from Dem Cut Boyz barbershop in Birmingham, Ala. where the honorable Lamont Brinson is my barber. I send this letter after a delegation from my haircuttery elected me to speak on their behalf, and presumably, for all of our people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesterday, during our busiest time of the day, we hosted a discussion about the recent Variety article revealing that the February 27 installment of Black-ish entitled \u201cPlease, Baby, Please\u201d had been shelved and replaced with a re-run. According to the report, the episode was canned because it dealt with the NFL kneeling issue and other political and social issues. We wanted to speak directly to you, Mr. Barris, because you are the creator of the show.\n\nWhen we read that the episode featured Anthony Anderson\u2019s character Dre, telling a bedtime story about his fears and concerns over the state of the country, we all agreed that it was a brilliant idea. We all realize we that America can only accept black truths if the revelations are embedded in dream sequences, superhero movie overtones or set to a beat that causes Caucasians to dance. (And you know you can\u2019t get dudes at a barbershop to agree on anything. In June 2016, while getting my beard trimmed, I argued that Serena Williams is the greatest athlete of all time\u2014male or female\u2014and they were still debating it yesterday.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told a thousand times that Black-ish is one of the only shows ever on network television to capture the sentiment of Black America. The \u201cFreedom\u201d musical episode was one of the highest-rated episodes ever on TV according to the Nielsen ratings. (Jerome Nielsen is one of the barbers here. Every time someone mentions Black-ish, he plays The Roots\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Just a Slave\u201d song on the boom box beside his barber chair.)\n\nAfter an emergency meeting using Roberts Rules of Order (Robert is one of our barbers who a struggles with the bald fade, but he keeps very good order) we passed a motion passed to ask you for one favor:\n\nYou have to leak the episode, bruh.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know that any request punctuated with the word \u201cbruh\u201d is very serious. We even took into account your quote in the article when you said: \u201cGiven our creative differences, neither ABC nor I were happy with the direction of the episode and mutually agreed not to air it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though you directed the episode and the show is one of the highest-rated and most awarded comedies on network television, we know that \u201cmutually agreed,\u201d in black parlance, means: \u201cThese white folks made the decision,\u201d We mutually agreed to pick cotton for 400 years. We \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to Jim Crow. We \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to systematic inequality. We are tired of mutual agreements.\n\nWe are not asking you to do anything illegal or even immoral. We would never ask you to violate your contract because we need more seasons of Black-ish.\n\nAs such, here is our offer:\n\nDem Cut Boyz barbershop offers free haircuts for life to Mr. Kenya Barris. During one of your appointments, I predict that you will fall asleep during a hot shave. Somehow, LaTrice Briscoe\u2019s bad-ass son, Deonte, will somehow \u201cfind\u201d the DVD or flash drive with the \u201cPlease, Baby, Please\u201d episode in your pocket. (Trust me, lil\u2019 Deonte is good at finding shit in people\u2019s pockets.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe episode will somehow end up being uploaded to YouTube, Facebook and Black America\u2019s favorite streaming service: World Star Hip Hop. I\u2019m not saying this was planned. I\u2019m just saying...\n\nWe know that ABC is owned by Disney, which makes them very sensitive to public sentiment. We also understand that, as a partner of the NFL, they don\u2019t like criticism of the National Football League. But this is your path to becoming an immortal legend and earning the title bestowed upon some of the all-time greats whose names are prefaced with the honorific: \u201cMy nigga.\u201d\n\nOur plan offers plausible deniability to both you and the network, and the leaked episode going viral could lead to an increase in ratings. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe make this offer with no strings attached and hope you will consider our proposal. If not, we will still watch Black-ish with the same loyal admiration knowing that you were unable to comply because of your \u201cmutual agreement.\u201d\n\nSincerely,\n\nDem Cut Boyz", "keywords": ["kenya", "blackish", "barris", "letter", "mutually", "know", "mr", "im", "cut", "black", "banned", "begging", "agreed", "leak", "open", "network", "episode"], "polarity": 0.18004065040650402, "subjectivity": 0.5725474254742549},

I was unmoved. I cried when my hairdresser found a bald spot the size of a silver dollar in the middle of my scalp while roller-setting my tightly coiled curls a month before. I cried when I discovered another bald spot at the base of my scalp while detangling my hair days later. I cried when I smelled my flesh burning during painful laser treatments to resolve another mysterious scar that had formed on my nose.\n\n\n\nAfter crying for months over losing locks of curls and undergoing what turned out to be unnecessary laser therapy, I searched for tears to cry at the possibility of having skin cancer as the dermatologist traced the edges of the dark growth with her scalpel. I had no tears left. After nonchalantly suggesting that I might have cancer, she stitched me up and sent me on my way.\n\nMy friends and family were concerned about my health. I, on the other hand, had just about given up. I was oddly relieved that a cancer diagnosis would at least be an end to the endless online searches for a name to my mix of symptoms.\n\nAfter the biopsy, my best friend called to check on me. Plainly, I told her that I would not mind if I went to sleep and never woke up. I was numb and did not think about how those words would land. Her voice broke as she asked me if there was anything she could do to help. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said. I shrugged my shoulders, hung up the phone and hoped that the painless end I had imagined would come true.\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\nMy stitches were removed, the results from the biopsy revealed that I did not have cancer and I found a new doctor who accurately diagnosed me with an autoimmune disease: discoid lupus. Discoid lupus is medically described as a skin condition in which sores appear on the face, scalp and arms and can cause alopecia. I describe it as my skin telling me that something\u2019s wrong and I need to chill out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one really knows what causes lupus. There\u2019s no cure for it. Symptoms come and go, and triggers ranging from antibiotics to the common cold can cause a flare. My skin lashes out at me most when I am stressed. A lupus rash rings the alarm when my hours working outweigh the ones I spend living, when I let someone undeserving take up too much of my emotional real estate or when I do not take the time I need to recharge.\n\nThree years after my original diagnosis, I have modern medicine to thank for helping me regrow my hair and control my lupus flares, but I have therapy to thank for helping me prevent my symptoms from returning in the first place. Twice a month, my therapist and I come up with strategies for managing life\u2019s inevitable ups and downs. We do intense work not only to analyze my feelings but also to plot out, step-by-step, how I can live the best version of my life.\n\nOf course, sitting on my therapist\u2019s couch and venting did not cure my lupus, but working with her has helped me use what I once thought was a curse as a signal to make important changes in my life. To avoid lupus relapses, I regularly edit my life by dumping toxic relationships, establishing boundaries at work, and spending time in spaces where I am loved, celebrated and nurtured. When my skin acts out, I take immediate action to figure out what\u2019s going wrong on the inside of my mind to help fix what\u2019s happening on the outside of my body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did not take my mental health seriously until my physical health was affected. I did not know just how strongly my body was tied to my emotional well-being. Truth is, before I noticed any lupus symptoms, alarms were going off all the time; I just did not hear them. Sleepless nights, recurrent headaches, anxious thoughts and panic attacks had become the norm. Through it all, I was maintaining an active social life and excelling at work.\n\nI had no idea that I had anxiety. High-functioning anxiety can be deceptive. For me, it looked like ambition, perfectionism or just everyday busyness. But underneath it all was tightness in my chest, constant worrying and fears that I just could not place. Going to therapy helped me put a name to what I was feeling, giving me the power to confront it, successfully manage it and eventually maximize my joy.\n\nFor years my anxiety hid itself from everyone, including me. Now that it\u2019s out of the shadows, I am, too.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "skin", "going", "colored", "cried", "scalp", "girls", "life", "health", "theyre", "lupus", "therapy", "dont", "symptoms", "struggling", "cancer"], "polarity": 0.032303391053391056, "subjectivity": 0.5345919358419359},

We wanted to speak directly to you, Mr. Barris, because you are the creator of the show.\n\nWhen we read that the episode featured Anthony Anderson\u2019s character Dre, telling a bedtime story about his fears and concerns over the state of the country, we all agreed that it was a brilliant idea.

What type of gift would this modern woman appreciate? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\n\n\n1. A Reading of the Good Book\n\nIf your grandmother cries out to black Jesus on a regular basis and carries around her own leather-bound copy of \u201cthe good book\u201d like Ruby Johnson, she might appreciate an audio version of the Scriptures. Available for download ($68) or on CD ($99), The Bible Experience features Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, Common, T.D. Jakes, Bumper Robinson, Meagan Good, Jasmine Guy, Idris Elba, Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Tia and Tamera Mowry, Yolanda Adams and more of your favorite celebs reading the Scriptures.\n\n\n\n2. Thirst Quencher\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBible thumping aside, Grandma takes a liberty or two here or there and isn\u2019t averse to a hard drink every now and again. Make sure her spirits are lifted wherever she goes with this Personalized Petite Bling Flask from Things Remembered ($30, online only). There\u2019s less whining when there\u2019s more wine.\n\n\n\n3. Kitchen Queen\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Ruby, your grandma isn\u2019t exactly a fan of her daughter-in-law\u2019s cooking. So let Nana strut her stuff and teach the younger ladies (and fellas) how to burn with this Occasion 18-Piece Cookware Set from T-Fal, available at Macy\u2019s ($129.99). She can show \u2019em better than she can tell \u2019em.\n\n\n\n4. Picture Perfect\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your grandma is like Ruby, she might sometimes focus on your faults instead of all your great qualities, but remind her why she loves you so much with this Grandma Wood Malden Picture Frame, available at Hallmark ($15.95). Fill it with that image of you and her that is guaranteed to make her glow with pride.\n\n\n\n5. Dear Diary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s the one who told you, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d but sometimes Nana forgets. So nudge her in the right direction with this Fearless Faith Journal from black-owned Olivia Sophia Stationery & Gifts ($14.99) that will allow her to vent and share her unsolicited, strong opinions without offending anyone.\n\n\n\n6. Crowning Glory\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuby Johnson likes to wear her hair natural, but some days she chooses to wrap it up. Colorful scarves can add some pop to her wardrobe while solving the problem of a bad hair day; and a headband like Nicole Ari Parker\u2019s GymWrap ($19.95) can help maintain a style while minimizing sweat resulting from energetic, heated conversations (or hot flashes).", "keywords": ["blackish", "grandma", "gift", "theres", "jenifer", "woman", "lewis", "style", "reading", "ideas", "feisty", "say", "picture", "good", "johnson", "available", "ruby"], "polarity": 0.28260939510939515, "subjectivity": 0.566032241032241},

I am, however, starting my journey toward becoming a therapist next spring and am developing an ultradope mental-health nonprofit to address the unique mental-wellness needs of black folks. I am but a humble, grits-loving chile who loves some therapy, writes about mental health, and loves to teach and talk about feelings and aha moments and dreams and growth. Being open about my struggles and sharing both the ugly and the excellent helps me purge and process my shit.\n\nI understand my limits as a nonprofessional. I took the Mental Health First Aid course in April and am taking the trainer\u2019s course in December so that I can help other people recognize various mental and emotional issues and disorders and can feel comfortable assisting folks in distress or de-escalating a potential crisis. Until I can crank dat licensure, I shall tell anyone who\u2019ll listen how great a tool therapy can be for helping you get your mind right.\n\nWhen everything first went bad back in the summer of 2014, a hella patient Nice White Lady helped me get up from the mud and get excited about being black and wonderful out here in these streets rather than ending it all with a bedsheet around my neck, as I had once considered down in Panama. It is largely because of those 10 months I spent fidgeting, rambling and weeping on that couch that I am here today to demolish chicken and gummy worms by the pound.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind as you start your fantastic voyage down the yellow brick road to see the Wiz for a new outlook on life:\n\nStarting therapy or counseling is a big deal.\n\nCelebrate this. Congratulations on taking this step toward getting (or keeping) your mental and emotional wellness on track. Per the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 43 million Americans suffer from some type of diagnosable mental illness, with about 10 million of those facing \u201cserious functional impairment due to a mental illness, such as a psychotic or serious mood or anxiety disorder,\u201d so you are far from alone in this fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether because of economic barriers, logistical woes, fear, stigmas or willful ignorance, many of us never get the care we need. Peeling off the flesh-toned Band-Aids and letting your skeletons and weak spots hang out can be terrifying. Being honest with yourself in front of someone else can be terrifying. But like booty play, it may be a tad uncomfortable before the ecstasy happens. [Editor's Note: *dead*] Stick with it. This is major.\n\nAppreciate the journey.\n\nI\u2019m a planner and a professional list-maker. I walked into my first session sweaty-palmed and carrying my journal with carefully curated questions. The last one, underlined and highlighted, was, \u201cGiven what you\u2019ve heard today, how many sessions is this going to take?\u201d I wanted a clear action plan, a manual and a target end date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI quickly learned that there was, sadly, no secret code that my Nice White Lady would perhaps feed me in pieces over the course of X number of sessions that I\u2019d have to decipher, at which point I\u2019d be able to zoom past Olmec\u2019s gates, into the temple, past the dungeon and through the secret room to unlock all the doors hiding the Secret to an Unmessed-Up Life or something, like the happy white kids used to do on Legends of the Hidden Temple. Didn\u2019t work like that.\n\nYou don\u2019t know this person.\n\nDo not worry about being judged by your chosen mental-health professional. You probably will not encounter this person in your daily life. Assuming that you\u2019re working with an impartial professional, you will not have to worry about him or her gossiping about you down at the church house or flinging holy water on you as he or she recoils in horror in line at Piggly Wiggly. None of that happens in therapy. This ain\u2019t Sunday dinner with Meemaw and your judgy and newly devout deacon-ass uncle\u2014the reformed serial baby-maker and legendary hometown coochie bandit. Whole different thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour counselor-psychiatrist-psychologist is there to listen, to guide you to important realizations, to help you develop the skills to cope and make it through the day, work through rough patches or everyday drama, and make sense of your life. This person is not employed to preach at you, talk at you or talk down to you. This is a professional, who is supposed to be unbiased, open-minded and easy to talk to. And although this person is there to work through intimate things with you \u2026\n\nYour therapist is not there to be your best friend or tell you everything you want to hear.\n\nGiven the intimate nature of the client-therapist relationship and the private things you\u2019ll share with your therapist, bonding and developing a warm rapport are natural. Sure, be friendly, cuss like hell and relate over hot comb horror stories. But avoiding a distracting level of personal involvement will help prevent conflicts and confusion about the nature (and limits) of your relationship. Your therapist is providing a service, not working to be the Pam to your Gina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect some awkwardness in the first session(s).\n\nEssentially, you\u2019re sitting down with a stranger and enlisting him or her to help you sort through the contents of your barrel o\u2019 baggage. Figuring out the client-counselor dynamic and building rapport is a journey in itself. Being nervous is fine. During your first session, your therapist will spend some (or the entire) time getting familiar with your specific situation and needs. It\u2019s a getting-to-know-you session, if you will.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to cover every woe in one sitting. You might sit down on the couch and cry for an hour. Or you may take the scenic route to vulnerability and spend a few sessions in silence. You might uncork and ramble for the entire session (I did). Open-mindedness helps. No two experiences will be the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s OK to want a therapist who shares your race, gender, religious situation or sexual orientation.\n\nWhen starting this journey, we all want someone who is professionally and culturally competent who can speak to us and our particular issues with ease. Given the infinite number of intersectional identities and experiences that lead folks to a therapist, it is not uncommon to have a muy eager, well-trained therapist who can\u2019t properly engage with your cultural background, gender identity, socioeconomic level, etc. Or a competent counselor who has some stigmas of his or her own to work through and who may unknowingly pathologize you or discount or misread your struggles because he or she is not sensitive to how racism affects your blackety-black ass.\n\nA therapist who shares your racial or cultural background may easily relate to, for example, mental-health issues related to race, systemic issues, discrimination and so forth. Pero remember: A shared identity does not guarantee competency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherapists and counselors are not infallible.\n\nTherapists are just like the rest of us: They may have their own unconscious biases, anxieties, privileges and cultural baggage to work through. They may seem like superheroes, but they are human. Double-booking, anyone?\n\nSelecting a therapist and building a relationship with one is a bit like dating.\n\nExcept the therapist lets you do all the talking, on purpose. And you pay every time. It could take five minutes or a few sessions for you to know whether this person is a match for you and where you are in life right now. Patience, grasshopper. There is much to consider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe therapist\u2019s style, personality, theories, level of training, experience, etc., must mesh with your personality, needs and expectations (if you have any). Over time, as you feel more comfortable, you dive deeper into that barrel o\u2019 baggage together and attempt to clean that bitch out. Or at least bring some order to the clutter within. It\u2019s a process. It\u2019s a situationship. It\u2019s complicated.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to ditch your therapist.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing personal. Don\u2019t feel bad if, after a few sessions (or one), you realize that this relationship is not a match or doesn\u2019t quiiiite feel right, even if you can\u2019t quite explain it. I waited a little too long with a Latina counselor because I appreciated that she cursed like I did, and I liked the casual vibe. But I ultimately felt as if I were talking to a homegirl in her office on her lunch break, not that I was making progress with my barrel o\u2019 baggage. I knew two sessions in that it wasn\u2019t a match, but I waited six sessions to bow out because I hoped that we would find our groove and I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings or be rude. Never again. #IceCold.", "keywords": ["starting", "therapist", "work", "session", "relationship", "person", "professional", "sessions", "talk", "therapy", "things", "consider", "mental"], "polarity": 0.07438672438672438, "subjectivity": 0.49072553931044505},

Simpson. The national obsession with him began in the late \u201960s, when he was one of the top football players in the country at the University of Southern California. Americans followed his career first as a record-breaking running back with the Buffalo Bills, then as an actor and a spokesman. He was all charisma in those years\u2014an irresistible combination of grace, good looks and controlled power that made him appealing even to white America.\n\nThen there was the crime\u2014and the trial\u2014of the century. The gruesome 1994 double murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman stunned the country, which became enthralled with the case. The ensuing trial launched media careers, spawning hours of coverage and analysis for a seemingly insatiable public. Years after Simpson was acquitted and before he was convicted on a separate robbery charge, he even appeared on his own reality TV show, Juiced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing has been missing through all of this: Simpson\u2019s account of what happened. That will change on Sunday, when Fox airs an interview with Simpson from 2006 called O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?

She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup.

The Hollywood Reporter explains:\n\nWith negotiations for the fifth season ongoing, sources say Ellis Ross feels that if she isn\u2019t brought up to Anderson\u2019s level, she may opt to appear in fewer episodes to make up the disparity by guesting on another show. The tactic has split opinions within Time\u2019s Up, with some worried that it\u2019s more a retreat than a forward-looking solution (fitting in extra work isn\u2019t always feasible, and often an actress wouldn\u2019t earn as much guesting as she would as a network star). A network source says a new deal will significantly increase her compensation and cautioned that Anderson and Ellis Ross\u2019 roles aren\u2019t equal given that he has been attached to Black-ish from the start and is an executive producer. Still, until a few weeks ago, this type of candid conversation would never have taken place outside an actress\u2019 agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, it\u2019s unclear what \u201csignificantly less\u201d means, but another egregious example discussed at the Time\u2019s Up table was the pay difference between actress Michelle Williams and her co-star, Mark Wahlberg, for their recent film All the Money in the World. In that case, Wahlberg was paid nearly 10 times more than Williams, taking home $5 million, compared with Williams\u2019 $625,000.\n\nThat Ross\u2019 pay gap with Anderson was brought up in the same conversation could mean they\u2019re facing a similarly severe pay disparity.\n\nBoth Ross and Anderson have starred on Black-ish since the show started running on ABC in 2014, and have received multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for their work on the series. Of the two, however, Ross is the only one to have taken home an award. In 2016 she became the first black woman in 35 years to win a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy or musical TV series.", "keywords": ["significantly", "blackish", "williams", "equal", "meeting", "reveals", "hollywood", "gap", "tracee", "timesup", "laughs", "pay", "anderson", "ross", "times", "actress", "paid"], "polarity": 0.14481951871657753, "subjectivity": 0.40148172905525853},

I was thrilled to see bisexual visibility on the show, and hope there will be more queer visibility overall\u2014not just for jokes or sensational provocation, but to highlight part of the wide human spectrum young people (should) encounter on a college campus.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u00fcber-adorable Luca, whose #BlackBoyJoy gender-nonconforming style makes me hope that he\u2019s actually Zoey\u2019s future love interest, rather than junior Hotep Aaron. (It doesn\u2019t hurt that I can\u2019t help imagining the writers spending several hours watching Jaden Smith\u2019s \u201cWatch Me\u201d video to get Luca\u2019s styling just right.)\n\nRefreshingly, Zoey\u2019s chill in Grown-ish feels like a great evolution from the one-dimensional mini-millennial she portrayed in early seasons of Black-ish. Back in those initial seasons, Zoey seemed not only extremely self-absorbed but also not the brightest bulb in the box. She\u2019s changed so much that now, when her parents make jokes about being surprised she got into college, it sounds like lazy writing. This Zoey was definitely going to college; she\u2019s the embodiment of #BlackGirlMagic.\n\nTV Promos via YouTube screenshot\n\nThe excitement for this new spinoff reminded me of when I was a young closeted lesbian, sitting in front of the TV absorbed with A Different World. When it premiered in September 1987, I was a sophomore in high school (I know, I\u2019m dating myself royally). At the time, I wanted to be Denise Huxtable and attend an HBCU. As the series progressed, all I wanted was for Jaleesa to be my big sister, Freddie to be my homey and Whitley to be my sorority sister, and to eventually fall in love with and wife up Kimberly Reese.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exploits that happened on the hallowed Hillman campus pushed my friends and me to believe that college was not just a thing we were going to do; it was a thing we had to do. We had to do it for the culture. For us\u2014and in many ways because of the show\u2014we knew that young black people went to college, and they were successful, smart and ambitious. They were everything I (and we) needed them to be at the time. They were mirrors reflecting black excellence. Those of us who grew up in that era sometimes even chose our colleges based on A Different World, and understandably share a nostalgia about the show because it pushed boundaries we hadn\u2019t seen before on television.\n\nSo when I heard that actress Yara Shahidi was starring in a Black-ish spinoff, I instinctively hoped that Grown-ish would be A Different World 2.0. And in many ways, Grown-ish is its spiritual successor; it\u2019s a spinoff from a popular black sitcom that focuses on the hip, stylish, too-cool-for-high-school daughter and her foray into college\u2014minus the HBCU (which is not an insignificant detail).\n\nOf course, like any good black Gen Xer, I spent a month or so binging on ADW as a primer for Grown-ish, and I can say with few exceptions, it still holds up. The most poignant episodes, like \u201cNo Means No\u201d (addressing date rape), \u201cA World Alike\u201d (about divestment from the South African apartheid state), \u201cIf I Should Die Before I Wake\u201d (on HIV/AIDS), \u201cMs. Understanding\u201d (our first glimpse of Hotep Nation) and \u201cCat\u2019s In the Cradle\u201d (the infamous racism episode) still feel especially fresh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact is, for a certain demographic of black folks, ADW is canon. I think to pre-emptively compare it to Grown-ish understandably draws ire. In a list of the most influential black shows, it reliably lands in the top 10, if not top 3. And though I agree with the writer of the controversial article in The Undefeated that by today\u2019s standards, ADW feels \u201csafe,\u201d it wasn\u2019t safe in its day. We have to remember\u2014and respect\u2014that ADW was a show that deeply influenced a generation of black Xers (myself included), and that\u2019s just real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the bigger reality is that we also can\u2019t hold Grown-ish to the standard ADW set for us as Gen Xers\u2014the first two episodes alone are a wake-up call that times have certainly changed. Honestly, we\u2019d be much better off comparing Grown-ish to the Netflix series Dear White People\u2014another show about millennial black folks in a predominantly white college\u2014than ADW. We don\u2019t even watch television the same way we did in the \u201980s and \u201990s; undeniably, millennials and their younger sibs, Generation Edge, have been regularly exposed to topics that felt edgy to us when we first experienced them on ADW.\n\nIt\u2019s also not fair to compare Zoey Johnson to Denise Huxtable, any more than Black-ish really compares to The Cosby Show (outside of the upwardly mobile black family of seven). Yes, Zoey is beautiful and fashion-forward and witty\u2014all the things we want our black girls to be\u2014but we are also watching her fall for a booty-call text as she pops another Adderall. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that her life won\u2019t be tied up in a neat 26-minute bow. The ADW generation are adults now, and as adults, the way we are watching this show will be different.\n\nEven the way Zoey\u2019s #BlackGirlMagic shows up is much different from our ADW faves. While it\u2019s tempting to compare her and her counterparts to the women on ADW, for me and many of my friends, those women embodied #BlackGirlMagic before we possessed that language.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI loved Jaleesa\u2019s strength and fortitude, Kim\u2019s mind and beauty, Whitley\u2019s confidence and pride and Freddie\u2019s youth and \u201cwokeness.\u201d Everything about those women made me think about what it meant to be a black woman. Even as a young lesbian who didn\u2019t necessarily see herself reflected in the show\u2019s completely heteronormative narrative, I knew that if I had half of what these women had, I could make it.\n\nWhat I do find myself hoping is that Zoey will give young black women a mirror for what #BlackGirlJoy may look like. Zoey, thanks to her upwardly mobile but racially obsessed father and her sometimes racially confused mother (I personally hated the tragic mulatto flavor of the episode \u201cBeing Bow-racial\u201d), has so far spent a life less intensely focused on her blackness\u2014she\u2019s been able to just grow up and live life. She is confident and, in her own way, quirky and naive. Zoey embodies an important quality that we want our young black women to have: an openness to the possibility of wonder.\n\nAnd though we should be careful about how we frame our admiration for celebrities, Yara Shahidi herself is a young black woman to admire. She speaks regularly on political issues and is invested in her academic career. She also embodies the #BlackGirlJoy we want for our young black women; we encourage them to be politically savvy, emotionally intelligent, and invested in themselves and their people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Different World will always resonate for those of us who grew up with it. I think that\u2019s why we hope Grown-ish and its young star Yara Shahidi will do the same for our younger cousins, siblings and children. They deserve to have the same thrill and the same hope we had when we watched our faves struggle, live, argue, pledge and find love at Hillman.", "keywords": ["different", "im", "cool", "black", "way", "grownish", "worldand", "world", "women", "adw", "isnt", "zoey", "college", "young"], "polarity": 0.125043446891273, "subjectivity": 0.4972915249002205},

For those not in the know, it\u2019s a spinoff from hit ABC show Black-ish that focuses on Shahidi\u2019s character, Zoey, and her journey from super-sheltered private school student to college freshman in this millennial world. Comparisons to A Different World will undoubtedly exist, but fuck that shit. We\u2019re going to let Grown-ish bounce, rock, skate and roll on its own merits, and so far, I\u2019m in.\n\nThe debut episodes brought me back to my college days\u2014kinda; we\u2019ll get to that later\u2014while also infusing enough blackness to keep me interested and anticipating future episodes. Here is a list of 10 things that were awesome (and black) about the first two episodes of Grown-ish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with the most obvious. By a show of hands, how many of you had any idea that the show itself would be on the Freeform network or had even HEARD of Freeform? Nobody? Good. I\u2019m not alone here. It wasn\u2019t until about 7:55 p.m. that I was like ... wait, why for come Grown-ish isn\u2019t showing up on my DirecTV channel guide on ABC?\n\nThen I looked it up online and saw it was on Freeform, cocked my head to the side and said, \u201cWhat the fuck is Freeform?\u201d These niggas just gon\u2019 make us LOOK for new channels? That\u2019s some black shit. Turns out Freeform is an ABC Family network or something. I was annoyed until Disney\u2019s Beauty and the Beast came on after and all was right with the world. Be our guest and shit.\n\n2. The first two episodes were titled \u201cLate Registration\u201d and \u201cBitch Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d using the tried-and-true method of naming things after black songs. I\u2019m all in on that level of blackness. It\u2019s a subtle way to infuse blackness that uncool white people won\u2019t understand without the help of a Magical Negro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Within the FIRST minute, we get footage from Freaknic (RIP), the freakfest that hit its hedonistic stride in the \u201990s, taking over and shutting down the streets of Atlanta every spring, AND Luke\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Rock.\u201d We just hit meta blackness.\n\n4. B.o.B. and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s song \u201cThe Kids\u201d plays in the first episode. Bobby Ray is a flat-earther, which makes sure to get some Hotep-adjacent nonsense into the episode without making it so blatant. Well-played, Grown-ish. Well-played.\n\n5. I appreciate how Randy\u2019s Donuts\u2014Inglewood, Calif.\u2019s famous landmark shop\u2014has become synonymous with black Los Angeles for all of us outsiders. It\u2019s been in videos, movies and television shows as a marker of \u201cHey, we in the hood now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Grown-ish, sister singing duo Chloe x Halle play Skylar and Jazlyn Forster, two track stars from the hood (running, not hair)\u2014hence the shot of Randy\u2019s Donuts. What makes this especially black? Glad you asked. They\u2019re signed to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Parkwood Entertainment imprint. We got Beyonc\u00e9 and Inglewood in one fell swoop, killing two black birds with one stone.\n\n6. Here\u2019s some extra-black shit of the \u201cFuck it, maybe nobody will notice\u201d variety: In the first episode, Vivek, the Indian kid who aspires toward Drakeness in life, is a label whore. That\u2019s fine; lots of us are. While they\u2019re showing us his label whoring, the show points out that his shoes are Adidas Yeezy 750 Boosts\u2014EXCEPT THEY\u2019RE NOT. They are Adidas, sure, but they\u2019re Pharrell\u2019s NMD Human Race red joints, an ENTIRELY different shoe. Oh, Grown-ish.\n\n7. They hit up a James Baldwin-themed photo exhibit. Two episodes into a show and we go straight for James Baldwin? Siiiiiiign me up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Zoey trying to knock out a paper on the Notorious RBG, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 1 a.m. and then 2 a.m. gave me actual nightmares. I recently told my boy\u2019s son, a soon-to-be high school graduate, that college was the best four years of my life and that I\u2019d go back, even with the work, and do it over. I think I forgot that \u201cdoing the work\u201d actually included writing papers again. I was NOTORIOUS for starting papers at midnight that were due at 8 a.m. and I NEVER LEARNED MY LESSON.\n\nI somehow managed to get a master\u2019s degree like this, culminating in a 50-page \u201cpaper,\u201d including a literature review, bibliography and fully cited sources, on how the government\u2019s HOPE VI housing program was a really good bad idea that displaced tons of black Americans in hopes of spurring gentrification because \u201cthe man\u201d\u2014that I wrote in 36 hours. What makes this a black-ass thing? I just mentioned gentrification. That\u2019s all I got.\n\n9. The character Luca\u2019s entire wardrobe looks inspired by the one and only Ghostface Killah, down to the rings, chains and the robelike clothing he sports in the second episode. He\u2019s who I should have been in college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I learned more about drugs in the second episode than I ever did in 38 years of life. Also, this is not true.

Simpson. The national obsession with him began in the late \u201960s, when he was one of the top football players in the country at the University of Southern California. Americans followed his career first as a record-breaking running back with the Buffalo Bills, then as an actor and a spokesman. He was all charisma in those years\u2014an irresistible combination of grace, good looks and controlled power that made him appealing even to white America.\n\nThen there was the crime\u2014and the trial\u2014of the century. The gruesome 1994 double murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman stunned the country, which became enthralled with the case. The ensuing trial launched media careers, spawning hours of coverage and analysis for a seemingly insatiable public. Years after Simpson was acquitted and before he was convicted on a separate robbery charge, he even appeared on his own reality TV show, Juiced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing has been missing through all of this: Simpson\u2019s account of what happened. That will change on Sunday, when Fox airs an interview with Simpson from 2006 called O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession? The interview, conducted by publisher Judith Regan, was tied to the promotion of the book If I Did It, in which Simpson, who continues to maintain his innocence, speculates on how he would have killed Brown and Goldman. The rights to it were acquired by the Goldman\u2019s family.\n\nSoledad O\u2019Brien, who hosts the Fox special, told The Root that the interview is unlike anything she\u2019s ever seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is one of the\u2014if not the most\u2014bizarre interviews I have ever been a part of in the last 30 years that I\u2019ve been in journalism,\u201d the veteran reporter said.\n\nSimpson speaks \u201cvery bluntly\u2014hypothetically\u2014but very clearly\u201d about what happened that night, O\u2019Brien continued. But what makes the interview particularly striking is Simpson\u2019s manic quality\u2014one that Terry Wrong, a producer of the special, mentioned in his interview with Variety.\n\n\u201cWatching his demeanor as he switches between being calm and laughing and then serious is really compelling and odd,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that despite hundreds of hours covering Simpson and the trial, she had never heard Simpson describe his relationship with Brown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d certainly never heard him on the stand; we never heard him describe his whereabouts on the day of the murders, either. Even that, in and of itself, gives you so much insight into their relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a completely different perspective because you are hearing from O.J. Simpson himself, and that has not happened before.\u201d\n\nWoven into the Simpson interview will be analysis and commentary from a panel of experts, including Simpson prosecutor Christopher Darden, a domestic violence expert, a criminal profiler and a longtime friend of Brown\u2019s. O\u2019Brien said that watching Darden\u2019s reaction to the interview was particularly hard.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo watch Chris Darden was like watching somebody get punched in the gut,\u201d she said. Another panelist, Brown\u2019s friend, cried while watching most of Simpson\u2019s interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2006 the I Did It book\u2014and its corresponding promotional tour\u2014were met with sharp backlash from the victims\u2019 families. They have since changed their minds, with both the Brown and Goldman families granting Fox permission to air the footage.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed\u2014and why should America listen to O.J. now?\n\nO\u2019Brien speculates that the families \u201cwanted the world to hear O.J. Simpson in his own words.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe never took the stand,\u201d she added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really have anything that he had said, and they felt that it was important to have him on the record.\u201d\n\nSimpson is now a free man\u2014out on parole after spending nine years in a Nevada state prison for a botched robbery in a Las Vegas hotel. He\u2019s still lodged very firmly within the public consciousness, thanks in no small part to the FX series The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which offered a dramatized look at the trial, and the Oscar-winning documentary O.J.: Made in America, both released in the last few years.\n\nO\u2019Brien knows that, over 20 years after the murders, most people have made up their minds about whether Simpson was guilty. But Simpson\u2019s story\u2014his ascent, his fall; the murders, the trial; and the long, winding aftermath\u2014remains so much bigger than the man himself, and explains why the fascination with him endures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are so many questions and also so many issues that are not about O.J. Simpson. The trial was about race. The trial was about celebrity. The trial was about policing. The trial was about discrimination. The trial was about the riots that had taken place years before,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trial was about justice, [and] who deserves justice. It was about so many things in addition to being about O.J.

While I was too young and too far away at the time to be directly affected by the Atlanta Child Murders\u2014a name given to the rash of murders of black children from many of Atlanta\u2019s impoverished communities from 1979 to 1981\u2014the era, subsequent search for, and eventual prosecution and conviction of Williams marked a very dark spot on the city.\n\nThe case involved disenfranchised black communities, the Ku Klux Klan, potential race wars, the Mayor\u2019s Office, the Atlanta Police Department, the FBI, the Chattahoochee River, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., James Baldwin and even a 1985 CBS miniseries called The Atlanta Child Murders, which included stars like James Earl Jones and Ruby Dee, as well as Morgan Freeman, which just proves that where there is blackness, there is Morgan Freeman.\n\nEven some of Atlanta\u2019s hip-hop acts have woven the tales into their rhymes, with lines like, \u201c ... the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne ... ,\u201d courtesy of Andr\u00e9 3000 on Goodie Mob\u2019s standout \u201cThought Process\u201d from their debut album, Soul Food, and again on their follow-up album, Still Standing\u2019s \u201cGutta Butta,\u201d this time courtesy of Khujo Goodie, where he states, \u201c ... and they know where to dump that ass, in the Cha-ttahootchee River with the rest of the kids ... ,\u201d a nod to the fact that several of the bodies of missing children, as well as those of two adult men, which ultimately brought down Wayne Williams, were found in the river.\n\nThe case of Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders has been the subject of books, essays and documentaries. Aside from the aforementioned miniseries, Soledad O\u2019Brien also did a deep dive into the case for CNN.\n\nAs a case, it\u2019s fascinating because so many actually believe that Williams is innocent, including family members of some of the murdered children, who think that Williams was used to cover up the true murderer, who might have been a white person or persons who could have torn the city apart at the seams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he was (or is) innocent, Williams did himself no favors, having failed several polygraphs and fabricating information given to the police. Also, circumstantial DNA evidence makes him responsible for at least the two adult cases, and he was tied to many of the child cases, though not all.\n\nNow, courtesy of HowStuffWorks and Tenderfoot TV, comes the podcast Atlanta Monster, hosted by Payne Lindsey. The podcast is a several-weeks-long podcast that takes the deep-dive, investigative journalistic approach to looking at the case. The podcast rehashes familiar information, but with new looks and interviews with people connected to the case and from locals in Atlanta who were children at that time.\n\nIt\u2019s two episodes in, and to call it riveting would be underselling it tremendously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also triggering. The entire story is about the deaths of almost 30 children; black children from some of Atlanta\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities. There were mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters separated from their kids and siblings. Grandmothers who sent their grandchildren to the store and never saw them again.\n\nAs a parent, I find the thought of losing a child nightmarish. Like this? Lord. I cannot imagine being a parent who had to watch the news, only to find out that another child was found dead, knowing that one\u2019s own child was missing, and sitting with evaporating hope and prayer each day. That must be one of the most harrowing experiences ever.\n\nWhile it is a case that was closed more than 30 years ago and is largely unspoken of\u2014especially in Atlanta\u2014the idea of vulnerable children being at the heart of it can make the story hard to listen to.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many adults in Atlanta who were children at the time of the child murders, after Williams was caught, he was akin to a bogeyman. I\u2019ve heard him referenced as, \u201cBe careful or Wayne Williams will get you.\u201d While the podcast is two episodes in, I can tell it will go there, considering that locals from Atlanta\u2019s west side are enlisted to recount the history.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing about this podcast so far that\u2019s interesting to listen to: Most documentaries I\u2019ve seen talk to family and law enforcement, but this includes actual Atlantans who grew up during the time, and not just politicians, but regular folks living in the city. We get to hear how it felt during that time.\n\nI\u2019m not the biggest podcast person, but this is one worth listening to because it revisits a case that captured national attention, and gripped a city, particularly the black citizens, while the white citizens were largely ambivalent. And then, once a person was convicted, the city pretended that it never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept it did happen; the city of Atlanta lost a significant number of its youths because nobody took the case seriously for almost a year because we were talking about black children. In episode 2, it\u2019s mentioned that during the terror, a fake call came in to authorities, threatening to kill a white child, and how that heightened some tensions. It\u2019s like A Time to Kill all over again.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a podcast to check out, this might be your bag, baby. Even though we know how it ends\u2014at least those of us familiar with the case\u2014the new information and rehashing of a case that affected so many families so like many of ours is worth the listen to hear how a community dealt with the loss of its youths. And how it\u2019s tried to move on.", "keywords": ["monster", "wayne", "williams", "case", "listening", "child", "black", "atlanta", "murders", "children", "city", "podcast"], "polarity": 0.10534324194324195, "subjectivity": 0.4692494986494988},

Sleight\n\nIf a white filmmaker had made this small, contemplative superhero origin story, it would have been enough to convince studio executives to give him a chance to make a big-budget genre film. Instead, many have still heard of neither the film nor J.D. Dillard, the black writer and director. Sleight takes seriously the question of what would happen if a superhero were to come out of a South Central, Calif., milieu. This is one of the most original superhero films of 2017.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Strong Island\n\nThis is a beautiful, devastating film about the 1992 murder of the filmmaker\u2019s brother that occurred on New York\u2019s Long Island and how, because the victim was black and the perpetrator white, justice remains elusive. Yet while Yance Ford explores the crime, he is more interested in what grief did to his family because they were forced to move forward without resolution. This is required viewing.\n\n\n\n3. Mudbound\n\nDirected by Dee Rees of Pariah fame and co-written by her and Virgil Williams, this Netflix original film examines how racism and war forever change two families\u2014one white, the other black\u2014struggling to survive in early-20th-century America. Mary J. Blige gives a powerful performance as the matriarch of the Jackson family. I expect her to receive an Oscar nomination for her role.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Girls Trip\n\nThe comedy of the year follows a group of black women as they reconnect in New Orleans during the Essence Festival. If you haven\u2019t seen this, shame on you\u2014but be warned: You\u2019ll never look at grapefruit the same again.\n\n\n\n1. Get Out\n\nThis is the movie of 2017. While it has been analyzed and discussed ad nauseam, the fact that Jordan Peele called this a documentary, not a fictional tale, is one of the most insightful comments he could have made about the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, the best television:\n\n5. Black-ish\n\nIn the same way that we take LeBron James for granted, we also take for granted this show\u2019s consistent greatness. It tells the hard truths about being black in America without losing sight of the joy that being black can bring. The fact that it does this on network TV and has not yet been canceled is a testament to the writing and acting on the show.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Underground\n\nAlthough it was canceled, this was one of the most original shows of the year. There were many narrative questions left unanswered, but that does not take away from the fact that this season was brilliant.\n\n\n\n3. Greenleaf\n\nThis season of Greenleaf was an honest examination of homophobia, class, family and pettiness within the black church. It doesn\u2019t hide the revered institution\u2019s imperfections; nor is it cynical about the good that can be found between those four walls. This and Queen Sugar are proof that Oprah has become the 21st century\u2019s patron saint of black visual art.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Queen Sugar\n\nIt was hard to put this at No. 2 because of the beauty and honesty of the show, which, in no small part, is because black women are deeply involved in the writing, direction and running of the show. Yet while the direction and writing of this show are top-notch, the performances of the actors in the series that is in the No. 1 spot, plus the sheer ubiquitous nature of that show\u2019s cultural conversation, are what place it just above this one.\n\n\n\n1. Insecure\n\nPart of why Issa Rae\u2019s HBO original series became a social media phenomenon is that each character in the show is so well-written, you can see why they make the poor decisions they do while still being angry with them for making those choices. The only thing I would change is the male lead\u2019s name. He is out here messing it up for everyone named Lawrence.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, I am Team Lawrence, but I ain\u2019t team that dude.", "keywords": ["white", "cut", "original", "superhero", "2017", "film", "shows", "family", "gotta", "black", "tv", "movies", "series", "writing", "shes", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.11444075587334017, "subjectivity": 0.450336227442969},

Her smile is so bright it lights up the darkest theater, cabaret, movie or television screen. Jenifer Lewis\u2014of Black-ish; Broadway\u2019s Eubie!; the films Beaches, Poetic Justice and What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It, among scores of others\u2014is fearless. That\u2019s a good thing because she is a bona fide, old-school star.\n\n\n\n\u201cI made my career my own. You know I gave up a few times, but I didn\u2019t quit. \u2026 It took a little out of my ass, but I stayed with it,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had the right to write this book because I did come through the fire, because I did sustain and because I continue to love it!\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 memoir, The Mother of Black Hollywood, is a rollicking, hilarious, emotional and visceral examination of a career most entertainers can only dream of. She knew this would be her life at the tender age of 5. That\u2019s when she did her first solo at the First Baptist Church in her hometown, Kinloch, Mo. Of course, she got a standing ovation. Lewis writes that she gave them her best imitation of gospel artist Dorothy Love Coates, and in that moment, her destiny as a singer was sealed.\n\n\u201cThere was never a doubt after that solo\u2014I never looked back. It was like a tsunami of love coming over the pews! I mean, it wasn\u2019t even a shouting kind of church,\u201d Lewis recalls, \u201cbut they were up, crying and screaming. I performed, and it was like I was born with it!\u201d\n\nLewis was so obviously born with it that she got her first Broadway role 11 days after graduating from college. The show was Eubie! It was June 5, 1979, and she was at the Ambassador Theatre standing onstage with the show\u2019s stars, Gregory and Maurice Hines. That catapulted her straight into the iconic black Broadway community\u2014which included the likes of Nell Carter, Hinton Battle, Vivian Reed and Andr\u00e9 DeShields.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were special! We were the gladiators of our time\u2014you know we had trained. You don\u2019t skip onto Broadway because you are pretty,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand it\u2019s Olympiad shit and no joke. Even at that young age, you had to stay in shape, stretch, take dance classes, take acting classes. I studied, I trained in the classics, Shakespeare, Brecht, and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I drank it all and was thirsty for more.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmore\u201d took Lewis through over 300 appearances onstage and in cabaret, film and television, drama and comedy. She has played everything from an unforgettable lead to a scene-stealing supporting character. But she admits that she had a little trouble transitioning from stage to screen because a woman whose voice was trained to hit the back row of a theater was a little loud for a camera.\n\n\u201cIn researching a character, you have to gather everything from your own life. If you don\u2019t know who you are, you can\u2019t put those pieces of the puzzle together. I had to do some serious work for that. \u2026 You know the camera doesn\u2019t lie. When you are in front of a camera, you have to believe what you say before you say it. It\u2019s either real or it\u2019s not,\u201d Lewis explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman who\u2019s been seen in everything from the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to the cult favorite Jackie\u2019s Back clearly got through it. Lewis has played the role of mother to everyone from Whitney Houston and Tupac Shakur to Taraji P. Henson and many others. Plus, the level of work she has put in to cement her status as a legend is a constant thread in her life. Lewis was never going to be a one-trick pony\u2014one of those folks who can only sing or only dance. She does it all.\n\n\u201cSee, my idols were Sammy [Davis] and Pearl Bailey\u2014these are the people I study. These were entertainers who were complete. They knew you had to do it all. They were funny. They had great presence. Charisma. They could sing and dance and act, so I knew I had to try and be even better than them,\u201d Lewis says.\n\nBut Lewis was nearly stymied by a problem that many African Americans ignore. The woman with a voracious sexual appetite and legendary temper was also crying herself to sleep. It turned out that Lewis had bipolar disorder. It has taken her years of therapy and medication to battle the illness. She has some advice to others experiencing such symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou just have to get sick and tired of being sick, and when you\u2019ve done that and you have the courage and the strength to say that\u2019s enough of that, then you make some changes,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not living with the disease or some disorder, somebody you know might be. So just reach out a helping hand and take them to get some help. But I always caution you: If they aren\u2019t going, they aren\u2019t going. So keep it moving so your arms will be strong for the next one.\u201d\n\nAs for the sexual harassment scandals rocking Hollywood and Capitol Hill, this woman who once talked her way out of being raped notes that such behavior has been going on since the dawn of time. But it is time, she says, for it to stop.\n\n\u201cThings are changing. Women are sick of being abused and used, beaten and discarded. We\u2019ve got a lunatic in the White House that says \u2018Grab \u2019em by the pussy.\u2019 Come on, now,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cYou can only fuck with a person so much. That\u2019s why they\u2019re coming forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe thinks the publicity will change the culture because young women will read about this, and when someone tries to attack them, they\u2019ll fight back because now they\u2019ll know for sure what\u2019s going on.\n\nIn a letter to readers at the end of her book, Lewis tells people that she wrote the memoir because she owes. She writes: \u201cBecause I survive, I owe. Because I live with bipolar disorder and thrive, I owe. \u2026 I owe it to the world to share what I have learned on my journey.\u201d\n\nLewis is a force of nature\u2014but she\u2019s a human being\n\n\u201cI never give 100 percent. I give 2,000. That\u2019s just how I roll,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cI\u2019m an alpha female. You know I\u2019m in the moment. If it\u2019s not serving the moment, leave me the fuck alone. You know when you turn 60 and realize you\u2019ve got about 30 summers left \u2026 that consists of joy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can hear Lewis\u2019 voice when the animated series Big Hero 6: The Series launches on Disney XD and the Disney Channel on Monday.

Simpson. The national obsession with him began in the late \u201960s, when he was one of the top football players in the country at the University of Southern California. Americans followed his career first as a record-breaking running back with the Buffalo Bills, then as an actor and a spokesman. He was all charisma in those years\u2014an irresistible combination of grace, good looks and controlled power that made him appealing even to white America.\n\nThen there was the crime\u2014and the trial\u2014of the century. The gruesome 1994 double murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman stunned the country, which became enthralled with the case. The ensuing trial launched media careers, spawning hours of coverage and analysis for a seemingly insatiable public. Years after Simpson was acquitted and before he was convicted on a separate robbery charge, he even appeared on his own reality TV show, Juiced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing has been missing through all of this: Simpson\u2019s account of what happened. That will change on Sunday, when Fox airs an interview with Simpson from 2006 called O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession? The interview, conducted by publisher Judith Regan, was tied to the promotion of the book If I Did It, in which Simpson, who continues to maintain his innocence, speculates on how he would have killed Brown and Goldman. The rights to it were acquired by the Goldman\u2019s family.\n\nSoledad O\u2019Brien, who hosts the Fox special, told The Root that the interview is unlike anything she\u2019s ever seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is one of the\u2014if not the most\u2014bizarre interviews I have ever been a part of in the last 30 years that I\u2019ve been in journalism,\u201d the veteran reporter said.\n\nSimpson speaks \u201cvery bluntly\u2014hypothetically\u2014but very clearly\u201d about what happened that night, O\u2019Brien continued. But what makes the interview particularly striking is Simpson\u2019s manic quality\u2014one that Terry Wrong, a producer of the special, mentioned in his interview with Variety.\n\n\u201cWatching his demeanor as he switches between being calm and laughing and then serious is really compelling and odd,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that despite hundreds of hours covering Simpson and the trial, she had never heard Simpson describe his relationship with Brown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d certainly never heard him on the stand; we never heard him describe his whereabouts on the day of the murders, either. Even that, in and of itself, gives you so much insight into their relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a completely different perspective because you are hearing from O.J. Simpson himself, and that has not happened before.\u201d\n\nWoven into the Simpson interview will be analysis and commentary from a panel of experts, including Simpson prosecutor Christopher Darden, a domestic violence expert, a criminal profiler and a longtime friend of Brown\u2019s. O\u2019Brien said that watching Darden\u2019s reaction to the interview was particularly hard.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo watch Chris Darden was like watching somebody get punched in the gut,\u201d she said. Another panelist, Brown\u2019s friend, cried while watching most of Simpson\u2019s interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2006 the I Did It book\u2014and its corresponding promotional tour\u2014were met with sharp backlash from the victims\u2019 families. They have since changed their minds, with both the Brown and Goldman families granting Fox permission to air the footage.\n\nWhat\u2019s changed\u2014and why should America listen to O.J. now?\n\nO\u2019Brien speculates that the families \u201cwanted the world to hear O.J. Simpson in his own words.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe never took the stand,\u201d she added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t really have anything that he had said, and they felt that it was important to have him on the record.\u201d\n\nSimpson is now a free man\u2014out on parole after spending nine years in a Nevada state prison for a botched robbery in a Las Vegas hotel. He\u2019s still lodged very firmly within the public consciousness, thanks in no small part to the FX series The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which offered a dramatized look at the trial, and the Oscar-winning documentary O.J.: Made in America, both released in the last few years.\n\nO\u2019Brien knows that, over 20 years after the murders, most people have made up their minds about whether Simpson was guilty. But Simpson\u2019s story\u2014his ascent, his fall; the murders, the trial; and the long, winding aftermath\u2014remains so much bigger than the man himself, and explains why the fascination with him endures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are so many questions and also so many issues that are not about O.J. Simpson. The trial was about race. The trial was about celebrity. The trial was about policing. The trial was about discrimination. The trial was about the riots that had taken place years before,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trial was about justice, [and] who deserves justice. It was about so many things in addition to being about O.J. Simpson that I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why it just never gets old, because there\u2019s still so much to parse through.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["discusses", "hours", "lost", "ojs", "trial", "confession", "simpson", "heard", "bizarre", "watching", "soledad", "simpsons", "oj", "obrien", "interview", "murders"], "polarity": 0.07712159863945578, "subjectivity": 0.43376700680272096},

Kenya Barris and crew decided that they wanted the crown for blackest prime-time television episode of all time (appropriately titled \u201cJuneteenth\u201d) and basically created a live-action version of a super-black episode of Family Guy complete with musical numbers, the Roots and the cartoon \u201cI Am a Slave\u201d (remixing Schoolhouse Rock\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Just a Bill\u201d)\u2014which you really have to see to fully appreciate the blackness. In fact, the episode was so black that it featured Aloe Blacc.\n\nTHEN, because they wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t have their blackness fucked up, they had a Hamilton-esque musical number titled \u201cWe Built This\u201d dedicated to the fact that slaves built every fuckin\u2019 thing in America.

Blacc then sets up the scene for the most heartwarming part of a most creative episode, a video done by the Roots on how Juneteenth began, a send-up of Schoolhouse Rock\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Just a Bill\u201d:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the episode featuring more musical numbers set during slavery and lines like, \u201cWe celebrate the Fourth of July, but not the day all Americans were free,\u201d Kenya Barris and his Black-ish writing team prove that they are some of the most deft comedic writers on the scene today, with the ability to handle thorny, black-ass topics while managing to be honest and funny AF.\n\nIn its last three seasons, Black-ish has taken on the subjects of \u201cblack names\u201d (the Johnsons\u2019 new baby is named Devonte\u2014yes, like dude from Jodeci); HBCUs vs. predominantly white institutions; and biracial identity, all with depth and humor.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarris told EW that he was really \u201cproud\u201d of the episode and that it forced him to examine his own scorn for \u201cblack holidays\u201d: \u201cYeah, the episode talks about how talking about slavery makes white people uncomfortable, I get that. At the same time, it\u2019s not indicting of anything contemporary. It really is more indicting, if anything, of black culture and being afraid of making other people uncomfortable, and thus disregarding our own past.\u201d\n\nI may be prone to hyperbole sometimes, but I say that this just may be one of the best TV episodes of all time.

This casting decision raises important questions about black entertainment, mental health and the blind eye we turn to violence against women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us were introduced to the fresh-faced Brown in 2005, when the then-15-year-old Tappahannock, Va., native and musical newcomer released the club hit \u201cRun it!\u201d Since then, Brown\u2019s career has been riddled with a series of arrests, court appearances and public incidents that raise questions about the 27-year-old\u2019s ability to take responsibility for himself and his actions.\n\nBrown\u2019s singing career has been essentially overshadowed by his violence against women.\n\nIn 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and served five years of probation after viciously attacking singer Rihanna. Yet he didn\u2019t learn much from the experience. After the two \u201cmade amends,\u201d Brown still didn\u2019t seem to view the altercation as much more serious than a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this month, Brown was served a restraining order after reportedly physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Her descriptions of the events that transpired between them include her claims of him \u201cpunching her in the stomach and pushing her down stairs.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t mistakes. They are evidence of long-standing issues with violence against women that the superstar has somehow managed to maintain while nurturing his on-again, off-again singing career.\n\nSome have suggested that Brown\u2019s issues with violence against women stem from substance abuse. To this effect, a Billboard expos\u00e9 published earlier this month claims that Brown has a crippling addiction to serious drugs like lean (a mixture of \u201cpromethazine/codeine syrup and a soft drink\u201d), coke and Molly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have said that Brown\u2019s aggression can be attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II, both of which he was diagnosed with in 2014. But the fact is, many people live with and manage mental-health conditions like PTSD and bipolar disorder every single day without physically harming anyone else. Studies actually show that bipolar disorder is not linked to violence. Rather, it is substance abuse that fuels the fits of rage against others.\n\nSo, yes, this is complicated.\n\nOn the one hand, Brown continues to show that he does not intend to take responsibility for his actions or his repeated injuries of his romantic partners. On the other hand, he is clearly self-medicating, which likely causes his violent behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsn\u2019t it time we started asking his team some questions, though? Why do they continue to watch Brown as he ruins his own life and the lives of others around him? At what point do they have that come-to-Jesus meeting and check him on his behavior? These are the types of preventive (and loving) actions that his family and friends should be taking. But it seems as if they are just along for the ride (a point made by Crissle and Kid Fury on a recent episode of The Read).\n\nMost importantly, Brown joins a long line of black men\u2014like R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Dr. Dre and many others\u2014whose artistic expression is often valued over their personal behavior. There are fans who would rather wear Beats by Dre than interrogate the irony of the brand\u2019s iconic name. They purchase tickets to awards shows and concerts where R. Kelly will perform, knowing full well that their money goes toward silencing the young black women and girls on Chicago\u2019s South Side who were reportedly sexually exploited by this man. These fans even say things like, \u201cBill Cosby has done so much for this community\u201d as Cosby himself admits to having drugged and sexually assaulted scores of women for decades.\n\n\n\nSimply put, there is no question that Brown has deep-seated issues with women and substance abuse. The two should not be seen as mutually exclusive. And what we shouldn\u2019t be doing is turning a blind eye to one in favor of the other, especially if it is only because we like his music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Black-ish team must know this.\n\nAlthough the producers and showrunners haven\u2019t yet spoken out regarding the casting decision, one could interpret the choice as an effort to support the artist through his rehabilitation efforts. But as late as 2014, the singer was kicked out of a Malibu, Calif., rehab center for allegedly breaking several of its policies\u2014namely, getting \u201ctoo close\u201d to women. Later that year, Rolling Stone reported on the prospects of a BET-backed Brown reality show that would chronicle his life following his arrest and stint in rehab. While the show never saw the light of day, it seems as though some networks are still willing to support Brown\u2019s behaviors even as he fails to change.\n\nTo empower Brown with a guest-starring opportunity on such a prominent black show\u2014which, mind you, employs black female activists who have repeatedly spoken out on issues that women of color face in entertainment\u2014seems counterintuitive and disrespectful to viewers who hold the show in high esteem. No matter what the intention, this casting choice reeks of enabling. It provides a blank check for a clearly ill person to continue to inflict harm on himself and those around him. Meanwhile, it sends the message that virtually any behavior is easily forgiven when ratings are at stake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of me wonders what the women on the show thought of this casting. I would expect Jenifer Lewis, Tracee Ellis Ross and Yara Shahidi to at least raise an eyebrow.\n\n\n\nWhile delivering a gorgeous acceptance speech at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards after winning for best actress in a TV comedy or musical series\u2014becoming the first black woman to win the award since 1983\u2014Ross said, \u201cIt is an honor to be on this show ... to continue expanding the way we are seen and known, and to show the magic and the beauty and the sameness of a story and stories that are outside where the industry usually looks.\u201d\n\nRoss hits on an important point here: Black-ish is such a powerful show mainly because it subverts the traditional storytelling and casting choices in Hollywood. It puts a quirky black family at the center of a universe and looks beyond the typical white veneer that has come to define so much of entertainment today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Brown\u2019s role on the show, Black-ish\u2019s producers run the risk of undermining these critical and hard-fought strides. While they are deliberately working against racial stereotypes through their full and vibrant depictions of black families, they still have an opportunity to tackle the nuances and complexities of gender and intimate-partner violence, especially where it concerns black women.\n\nBut casting Brown is a step backward. It proves that misogynoir and violence against women have still not registered with many leaders of industry as deal breakers for their faves. It is up to viewers to take to task the casting directors and the responsible parties behind this choice.\n\n\n\nWhat Brown needs is more (and better) people, not more casting credits. Until these record labels, networks and shows grapple with the equal importance of what these artists do both on and off the set, we must continue to hold them accountable.\n\n", "keywords": ["blackish", "appearance", "browns", "singer", "violence", "black", "continue", "casting", "guest", "substance", "women", "issues", "chris", "brown"], "polarity": 0.06144487200042756, "subjectivity": 0.49647560258671347},

About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah.

When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood.

I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then.

I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

It begins with acknowledgment that black people play a pivotal role in shaping various sectors of popular culture in the U.S. In its findings, \u201c73 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 67 percent of Hispanics believe that African Americans influence mainstream culture.\u201d Congratulations to all who can clock the obvious without complication.\n\n\n\nNow, as the report shifts to its specific focus, Nielsen notes, \u201cSeveral programs with a predominantly black cast or a main storyline focusing on a black character are drawing substantial non-black viewership.\u201d\n\nExamining 2016-2017 television, the study finds:\n\nWith 89 percent nonblack viewership, This Is Us, NBC\u2019s Golden Globe-nominated ensemble dramedy, includes Sterling K. Brown as a black businessman raised by white parents and tackles topics such as drug addiction, racism, homosexuality, alcoholism, adoption, obesity and cancer.\n\nABC\u2019s hit sitcom Black-ish follows a father and husband (Anthony Anderson) who\u2019s trying to create a sense of black cultural identity for his affluent family of four and has 79 percent nonblack viewership. Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays his wife, won the best actress in a comedy series Golden Globe for her role.\n\nThree-fourths of the viewers are nonblack for Secrets and Lies, the ABC crime drama that revolves around the biracial heir (Michael Ealy) to a Charlotte, N.C., equity firm and the murder of his wife.\n\nABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder is the Shonda Rhimes hit drama starring Academy Award winner Viola Davis as a criminal-defense professor who gets entangled in a murder plot. Sixty-nine percent of the show\u2019s viewership is nonblack.\n\nSixty-eight percent of viewership is nonblack for ABC\u2019s Scandal, a Shonda Rhimes \u201cShondaLand\u201d thriller featuring Kerry Washington as a media consultant to the president.\n\nWith 63 percent nonblack viewers, Fox\u2019s Pitch is a dramedy about the first woman, a black woman, to play baseball in the Major Leagues.\n\nInsecure is the HBO original comedy series co-created by Golden Globe-nominated Issa Rae. Inspired by Rae\u2019s popular web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, viewership is 61 percent nonblack.\n\nHalf of viewership for the newcomer Atlanta is nonblack. The show, a Golden Globe-winning comedy-drama on FX created by and starring Donald Glover, centers on two black cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the tone of this study, one is supposed to find this encouraging.\n\n\n\nIndeed, of its findings, Andrew McCaskill, senior vice president, communications and multicultural marketing at Nielsen, says:\n\n\n\nMuch of the American narrative lately has focused on a growing cultural divide. But Nielsen\u2019s data on television programming show something different. Storylines with a strong black character or identity are crossing cultural boundaries to grab diverse audiences and start conversations. That insight is important for culture and content creators, as well as manufacturers and retailers looking to create engaging, high-impact advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRespectfully, presenting data that reveals that black-led television shows have crossover appeal is akin to other earth-shattering news like Popeyes biscuits taste like heaven in your mouth, there\u2019s nothing like being debt-free and dick too bomb.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing remotely revealing about this information. The same goes for the study\u2019s noting that shows with a majority-black audience, like Empire, can manage to still \u201cpropel a show to Emmy-nominated, award-winning mainstream success.\u201d\n\nYes, Taraji P. Henson is a Golden Globe-winning, Emmy-nominated actress thanks to her role as Cookie Lyon on Empire, but you know who long ago met this feat? Jack\u00e9e Harry, who remains the first and only black woman to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She won for her role as the original Instagram model Sandra Clark on 227. 227 was a show about working-class Negroes in Washington, D.C., before the white folks took over and put bike lanes on Georgia Avenue near Howard University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo am I supposed to be thrilled about this news that could easily have been packaged with the hashtags of #TBT or #FBF? Sorry, Nielsen, but I do decline. To be fair, Nielsen does note that television shows such as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son and The Cosby Show had already proved that our shows can be watched by all. Even so, Nielsen offers the addendum: \u201cWhat\u2019s unusual now is the sheer number of such programs that are carrying cross-cultural appeal.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t much \u2019bout al-ge-bra, but I do know if a few black shows can claim crossover appeal, an increased volume ought to yield a similar result. Us black folks are pretty diverse, don\u2019t ya know? I mean, clearly America had Negro fatigue, as evidenced by that new man in the White House, but if The Cosby Show and A Different World could thrive as trifling Ronald Reagan hollered about welfare queens and crack, Issa Rae, Donald Glover, Kerry Washington and Viola Davis can maintain success under Minute Maid Mao\u2019s mismanaged terrorist reign.\n\nSo, now that we know that the truth of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s is true in the 2010s, what will networks do about it? Will they continue to be more inclusive in their background? They could. After all, it would be nice to see more visibility in terms of class, gender and sexual orientation. We may be seeing more of us on television, but it\u2019s still not all of us. Maybe networks will finally embrace a stubborn reality and keep a great thing going.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr they could follow their previous pattern of seeing our value and casting it aside anyway. In some respects, you already see that. Go ask Tamron Hall. Go ask anyone black who tried to launch a successful television show in the late 1990s or 2000s.\n\n\n\nI want to be hopeful because hope is all we have. However, while others celebrated this survey, I found it largely inconsequential. Those majority-white executives have always known that black people and black culture can reach all. It is a debate that has long been settled.\n\n\n\nAgain, the question is not can we be appreciated by all, but when will our value finally be acknowledged, accepted and, mostly, continuously invested in? Then we can ask about a proper Girlfriends series finale or full-out reunion because Joan and Toni not reuniting before the conclusion was some bullshit. Consider that a part of the reparations backstage, white people.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "appeal", "know", "nonblack", "shows", "golden", "black", "viewership", "tv", "crossover", "television", "treatment", "sidepiece", "blackled", "nielsen", "series"], "polarity": 0.1290927822177822, "subjectivity": 0.48281041874791863},

Club look at the latest streaming TV arrivals, each making the case for a favored episode. The reasons for their picks might differ, but they can all agree that each episode is a must-watch. In this installment: Black-ish, all episodes of which are now streaming on Hulu. (New episodes air Wednesdays at 9:31 p.m. Eastern on ABC.)\n\nKenya Barris\u2019 Black-ish is now in its third season, where it\u2019s been racking up accolades for its incisive humor and multigenerational relevance\u2014Tracee Ellis Ross recently picked up a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Johnson family matriarch Rainbow, and she, co-star Anthony Anderson (playing Bow\u2019s husband, Dre), and the show itself were all Emmy nominees in 2016. Despite being a family series, Black-ish tackles plenty of weighty subject matter, including racism and cultural bias. But it does so with the perfect blend of comedy and frustration\u2014you\u2019re never going to get a lecture from Black-ish, but you will learn something. We realize it\u2019s become alarmingly easy to fall behind on even some of our favorite shows, even with the aid of DVRs, streaming queues, and second screens. But Hulu recently stepped up on behalf of Black-ish fans and cord cutters everywhere, acquiring the exclusive rights for subscription video on demand. We\u2019ve done our part by putting together a list of five episodes to help you find your way (back).\n\nAshley\u2019s pick: \u201cPops\u2019 Pops\u2019 Pops\u201d (season one, episode 24)\n\nBlack-ish isn\u2019t interested in exploring what blackness is like only today but also the history of that experience. No episode merges Black-ish\u2019s comedic take on modern and historical blackness better than \u201cPops\u2019 Pops\u2019 Pops.\u201d As youngest Johnson kids Jack (Miles Brown) and Diane (Marsai Martin) work on a family tree for school, they realize they can only go back so far before running into question marks. While their classmates can pinpoint their ancestry back to the Mayflower, the Johnson family doesn\u2019t have the same luxury. So, they have to rely on Pops\u2019 (Laurence Fishburne) over-the-top family folklore to fill in the blanks. \u201cPops\u2019 Pops\u2019 Pops\u201d transports all of Black-ish\u2019s characters to the Harlem Renaissance\u2014even Dre\u2019s office is given an old-timey makeover. Although Pops\u2019 story becomes more and more outlandish, the episode\u2019s focus on family keeps things grounded. Even cameos from Mary J. Blige and P. Diddy fit right into Black-ish\u2019s fantastical take on black history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Ashley Ray-Harris]\n\nPilot\u2019s pick: \u201cTHE Word\u201d (season two, episode one)\n\nThe second season premiere, \u201cTHE Word,\u201d immediately dispelled any notions that the quality of the first season was a fluke. Black-ish came roaring back with its trademark edge and humor: beginning with Jack rapping Kanye West\u2019s \u201cGold Digger\u201d and eschewing the radio edit, thus plunging the episode into an intelligent and often funny conversation about the N-word. The reason why \u201cTHE Word\u201d works so well\u2014besides the utter adorableness of Jack\u2014is because Black-ish commits to showing all sides of the debates. This commitment is a staple of Black-ish; often we see how Bow and Dre disagree on something, or Dre and Pops (and so on), and equal weight is given to each of their sides. \u201cTHE Word\u201d reiterates this commitment by putting multiple opinions on the table: It tackles the N-word from nearly every perspective, from Bow\u2019s shock and anger to the argument that it\u2019s basically a birthright\u2014Dre humorously compares it to Jewish children who get to go to Israel\u2014to the idea that we\u2019re reclaiming a negative word and turning it into a positive to even eldest daughter Zoey\u2019s (Yara Shahidi) nonchalance at her white friends casually dropping N-bombs. But \u201cTHE Word\u201d also showcases another important aspect of Black-ish by refusing to give the viewers a clear-cut take on what\u2019s right or wrong. It provides us with a blueprint for conversation; we have to build an answer ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Pilot Viruet]\n\nErik\u2019s pick: \u201cCharlie In Charge\u201d (season two, episode seven)\n\nRunning gags and solid recurring characters are the embroidery of any good sitcom. Black-ish combined the two into a doozy of an adornment in season one\u2019s \u201cMartin Luther Skiing Day,\u201d which introduced the smoldering hostility between Dre\u2019s co-worker Charlie Telphy (Deon Cole) and Diane. He calls her \u201cGirl Twin,\u201d she addresses him by his full first name, and their nonsensical conflict gives Black-ish some of its biggest out-of-left-field laughs. Several of those come from \u201cCharlie In Charge,\u201d the season-two installment in which a misdial from a heavily medicated Dre puts Charlie in the position of supervising Junior (Marcus Scribner), Jack, and Diane\u2019s days, nights, wrongs, and rights. Diane seethes while her brothers do some Nancy Meyers-inspired wing-manning (as they say, it\u2019s\u2026 complicated) between Charlie and his old flame, Dominique (Amber Rose), but she demonstrates her true cunning by refraining from outright sabotaging the evening. \u201cCharlie In Charge\u201d is evidence that Black-ish\u2019s spoils extend beyond the Johnsons\u2014even if one of the Johnsons wouldn\u2019t approve of Charlie being spoken of in such glowing terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Erik Adams]\n\nAllison\u2019s pick: \u201cThe Johnson Show\u201d (season two, episode 21)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Johnson Show\u201d isn\u2019t where you turn if you\u2019re looking for the most groundbreaking episode of Black-ish\u2014for that, see \u201cHope\u201d or \u201cLEMONS\u201d or \u201cPops\u2019 Pops\u2019 Pops\u201d\u2014but it crystallizes what makes this series so special in 21 perfect minutes. The formula: Take a plot designed to push Dre and Bow to their limits, throw in a big wrench, and lace it with the kind of honesty and relevance you don\u2019t often find in sitcom-land. The plot in question is a simple one, with Bow and Dre both feeling the pressure to live the perfect life with their perfect family. In Dre\u2019s case, he\u2019s afraid that rumored layoffs at work will turn him into just another black guy without a job, while Bow throws an auction for the school but can\u2019t ask for help, lest the other moms smell weakness. The wrench comes in the form of Jenifer Lewis\u2019 Ruby, who convinces her grandkids that stealing gift cards is fine, since no one ever actually uses them. It\u2019s a great, unsurprisingly funny plot, but what elevates \u201cThe Johnson Show\u201d from solid to pretty much perfect is The Cosby Show. Episode writer Corey Nickerson uses Dre and Bow\u2019s Huxtable aspirations to draw out questions about representation, double standards, and the need to be \u201cthree times as good.\u201d If it sounds like subtle, thoughtful stuff, it is, but Black-ish has a gift for tackling big questions without straying into the territory of the very special episode. It might be relevant and timely, but when something\u2019s this delicious, you sometimes might not notice that you\u2019ve also eaten your vegetables.\n\n[Allison Shoemaker]\n\nDanette\u2019s pick: \u201cDaddy Dre-Care\u201d (season two, episode 23)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack-ish often transcends its family sitcom format while remaining firmly rooted in the genre. Kenya Barris and his writers touch on many of the tropes we\u2019re used to seeing in sitcoms, like the bumbling father who ends up doing more harm than good. But Black-ish is also revolutionary for having a far more equitable partnership at its core than most TV families. After all, there are now whole sitcoms of those guys getting their comeuppance for leaving the parenting to Mom. This late season two episode sees Dre thrust into the parenting spotlight\u2014he must look after his flu-ridden children and his ailing mother and wife. Black-ish could easily milk the situation for all of its \u201cBUT I WANT MOM\u201d humor, which it does early on. (Bow is a mother and a doctor\u2014who wouldn\u2019t want her looking after them?) But even though I could watch a marathon of episodes of Ruby and Bow watching a Bette Midler marathon, it\u2019s when \u201cDaddy Dre-Care\u201d shifts gears and shows off Dre\u2019s own nurturing side\u2014which is very much in his own style\u2014that we get much more than laughs. Dre reaffirms to everyone (including himself) that he\u2019s a great dad, and just in time, too, since this is the episode where Bow\u2019s pregnancy is revealed.\n\n[Danette Chavez]", "keywords": ["blackish", "pops", "catch", "dre", "word", "bow", "family", "charlie", "season", "episodes", "episode", "johnson"], "polarity": 0.21502721088435378, "subjectivity": 0.5381224489795917},

It feels as if, after Family Matters and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air went off the air, the idea of black family comedies went right out the door with them. Though many have tried (My Wife and Kids, Reed Between the Lines), the quality and thought-provoking content featuring black families has been subpar.\n\n\n\nUntil Black-ish.\n\n\n\nFrom conversations about religion and faith to conversations involving the dynamics of the black family, this season of Black-ish is LIT.\n\n\n\nI will admit that when Black-ish premiered, I was skeptical of the series and its title. However, after reading the premise of the show, I was pleasantly surprised and happy that we finally had a modern show about a black family, excelling and thriving in their day-to-day lives, dealing with real day-to-day black issues. I was also pleased to see that the writers took a page from The Cosby Show to show not only black love in a positive light but also the struggles that black parents have raising pro-black children.\n\n\n\nIn past seasons, the show has elevated topics around issues pertaining to the n-word and the struggles that black families have dealing with discrimination in white suburbia. The show even went so far as to discuss the importance of talking with our children about movements like Black Lives Matter and what black children need to know about protecting themselves against police brutality.\n\nBut season 3 is (in my opinion) the best season thus far. It feels as if the writers have begun to authentically incorporate current events into the series themes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, on the episode \u201cLemons,\u201d Dre (Anthony Anderson) gave one of the most profound speeches in black television history. The episode highlighted the frustration that many black people have with 2016\u2019s election results, and the pain that many black people have been dealing with. As Anderson\u2019s Dre says:\n\n\n\nBlack people wake up every day believing that our lives are going to change, even though everything around us says it\u2019s not. Truth be told, you ask most black people and they tell you no matter who won the election, they don\u2019t expect the hood to get better. But they still voted because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. ... I\u2019m used to things not going my way. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re not and it\u2019s blowing your mind, so excuse me if I get a little offended because I didn\u2019t see all of this outrage when everything was happening to all of my people since we were stuffed on boats in chains. I love this country as much, if not more, than you do. And don\u2019t you ever forget that.\n\n\n\nThis week\u2019s episode offered a more comedic take on how black families talk about self-help. Though the episode centered mostly on Rainbow\u2019s (Tracee Ellis Ross) need to see a therapist regularly, the show pointed to a more covert conversation about the way black men, specifically black fathers, deal with their daily frustrations and anger issues. This episode was extremely timely considering the levels of stress that black men carry both inside and outside the home and the lack of conversations we have around helping black men maintain their wellness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack-ish is the show that black people have been wanting and needing for a very long time, and this is reflected in all the awards the show and its cast members have received. It\u2019s so refreshing to see black love portrayed in a truthful and honest way while the 21st-century black family is seen as aware of what\u2019s going on around it, something that other shows never dared to do. As someone who loves black sitcoms, I am so happy to see a TV show that paints the black family in a not-so-perfect fashion while staying true to the idea that an American family can, in fact, be black.", "keywords": ["blackish", "winning", "went", "family", "black", "way", "season", "lives", "men", "episode", "issues", "love"], "polarity": 0.08409899172557395, "subjectivity": 0.49835137436403243},

Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts? Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

What type of gift would this modern woman appreciate? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\n\n\n1. A Reading of the Good Book\n\nIf your grandmother cries out to black Jesus on a regular basis and carries around her own leather-bound copy of \u201cthe good book\u201d like Ruby Johnson, she might appreciate an audio version of the Scriptures.

Thirst Quencher\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBible thumping aside, Grandma takes a liberty or two here or there and isn\u2019t averse to a hard drink every now and again. Make sure her spirits are lifted wherever she goes with this Personalized Petite Bling Flask from Things Remembered ($30, online only).

But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: the couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said \u2018yes,\u2019 because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th birthday party for his new fianc\u00e9e, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward...[I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond and pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown and black girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters, and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation, his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown, with a deep-v neckline and blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, The bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit. The color also played well off of the rose gold of Iman\u2019s engagement and wedding rings, which is her favorite metal and the only one she wears\u2014even the chairs in the reception ballroom were rose gold!\n\nWith friends Chrissy Teigen, Tiffany Haddish and Gabrielle Union in attendance\u2014and yes, that\u2019s Odell Beckham in the wedding party; Iman and Shepard met at one of his parties\u2014this truly looked like the wedding of the year.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: the couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said \u2018yes,\u2019 because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th birthday party for his new fianc\u00e9e, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward...[I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond and pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown and black girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters, and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation, his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown, with a deep-v neckline and blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, The bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit. The color also played well off of the rose gold of Iman\u2019s engagement and wedding rings, which is her favorite metal and the only one she wears\u2014even the chairs in the reception ballroom were rose gold!\n\nWith friends Chrissy Teigen, Tiffany Haddish and Gabrielle Union in attendance\u2014and yes, that\u2019s Odell Beckham in the wedding party; Iman and Shepard met at one of his parties\u2014this truly looked like the wedding of the year.

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That. Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts?

I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm.

When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: the couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said \u2018yes,\u2019 because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th birthday party for his new fianc\u00e9e, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward...[I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond and pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown and black girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters, and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation, his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown, with a deep-v neckline and blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, The bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit. The color also played well off of the rose gold of Iman\u2019s engagement and wedding rings, which is her favorite metal and the only one she wears\u2014even the chairs in the reception ballroom were rose gold!\n\nWith friends Chrissy Teigen, Tiffany Haddish and Gabrielle Union in attendance\u2014and yes, that\u2019s Odell Beckham in the wedding party; Iman and Shepard met at one of his parties\u2014this truly looked like the wedding of the year.

But it has to be super hard when your mom keeps bashing the team you play for.\n\nSuch is life for New York Giants cornerback Eli Apple. Apple's mother, Annie Apple, is an outspoken survivor of domestic violence, so, rightfully, she was incensed after learning that the Giants not only knew about kicker Josh Brown's history of domestic violence but also elected to keep him on the team.\n\nAnnie Apple took to Twitter to voice her disbelief regarding the organization's actions and had some pointed words for Giants owner John Mara. In a follow-up piece for Sports Illustrated, Annie Apple noted that the Giants' London game was hard to watch knowing that the team hadn't parted ways with Brown. The team has since let the kicker go.\n\n\"I flew to London last Wednesday to watch a game that by Sunday no longer mattered to me. We went overseas to watch Black Eli back on the field as the Giants faced the Rams. But I never made it to Wembley,\" Annie Apple wrote. \"At that moment I just couldn't cheer for a team I felt had turned its back on what was right to protect an image. It was difficult because I love my son and I've always been in his corner at every game, but for me, this was bigger than a game.\"\n\nShe didn't stop there; she also said the organization was \"leaning heavily\" on her son to silence her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But I was livid with the Giants, not just because of John Mara's comments, but I was disappointed in the organization because I felt they were leaning heavily on a 21-year-old kid in an effort to control what his mother says. That's not fair,\" Apple wrote. \"Did I rob a liquor store in the middle of the night rocking a NY Giants Apple jersey? No. I merely shared my disappointment and sadness in the team's callous response to domestic violence because I am a survivor and it impacted me in a deep way.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Eli Apple was forced to answer questions about his mom's claims that the organization was trying to use him to shut his mom up.\n\n\"She was a little bit upset, and I didn't have a chance to really talk to her, and I guess throughout that whole thing that's just how she felt, but I never had a chance to talk to her or anything, so maybe that's just an assumption of hers that she just felt in her gut,\" he said, the New York Daily News reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But it's definitely false. Nobody's leaning on me or anything telling me things to tell her. It's not like that at all. I think the Giants are a class organization, and I'm just happy to be here,\" he said.\n\nClearly Annie Apple is right in her position, but I do feel for her son. Here's hoping that there is an amicable way that mother and son can bridge this gap, but if Eli Apple's mom is anything like my mom (judging by her writings, she is exactly like my mom), then good luck.\n\nRead more at Sports Illustrated and the New York Daily News.", "keywords": ["stop", "son", "bashing", "organization", "annie", "felt", "mom", "giants", "eli", "team", "apple", "wont", "awkward", "rookies", "york", "nfl"], "polarity": -0.028593779408996805, "subjectivity": 0.4306535855448899},

At the top!\n\nHow did you become so iconic?\n\nIt\u2019s the combination of my look and DeRay\u2019s advocacy. We are always on the front lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s true. You do advocate for a lot of marginalized groups.\n\nNah, I meant the advocacy work we\u2019ve done for Deray.\n\nWe are on the front lines, so the cameras always catch us in our electric blue splendor. You gotta be up front if you want the good Instagram shots. He makes me look like I\u2019m in style and I make him seem mysterious and aloof because no one can figure out what my deal is. Am I bulletproof? Am I one of many vests? Is there a deeper meaning?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer is: There is no cache of vests in the closet\u2014just me. I\u2019m on my way to becoming a civil rights icon, like Malcolm X\u2019s skinny tie or Harriet Tubman\u2019s bonnet. And as far as the bulletproof thing goes, let\u2019s hope we never have to find out.\n\nI see. So why are you two so inseparable?\n\nFirst, you have to realize how useful I am. Have you ever seen DeRay? I mean ...we\u2019re cool and all, but he\u2019s like 112 pounds, soaking wet. You can\u2019t be at the protest looking like a mark. That\u2019s how you get \u201cgot.\u201d I give my nigga heft, you know what I\u2019m saying?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, the law of the streets is that you never mess with anyone wearing a puffy vest over a suit jacket because you don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to. Could be a hipster who stopped by Panera Bread on his way home from the office, or it could be a nigga with a strap. You never know.\n\nOne of the most underrated things about me is how much I have helped advance DeRay\u2019s career. A few years ago he was just some dude who was in Ferguson chanting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d along with thousands of others. Now he\u2019s one of the most recognizable faces in the movement. That\u2019s because of me.\n\nBecause of you?\n\nOf course it is. I\u2019m DeRay\u2019s brand, and there\u2019s nothing people love more than branding. I\u2019m arguably the most recognizable piece of clothing in the country. I\u2019m willing to bet that he\u2019s more recognizable than anyone in the movement. That\u2019s because of me. Have you ever heard about Deray\u2019s fresh, minty breath?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople say it smells pretty good.\n\nThat\u2019s because I always have a fresh pack of tic-tacs in my inside pocket, that\u2019s why! And my ample cushioning muffles the rattling sound. I also keep his business cards right here\u2014top left. Chapstick? Right waist pocket. Can\u2019t have the homey out in these streets looking like Malik Yoba in the mouth.\n\nAnd yes, I know I\u2019m hated on a lot, but I keep the game on lock. Like my grandmother used to tell me: \u201cThey say \u2018clothes don\u2019t make the man\u2019 ... until they\u2019re sitting face-to-scrotum next to a naked guy on the F train.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGod rest her soul.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. How did she die?\n\nShe didn\u2019t. She was a bedazzled, acid-washed My Little Pony jean jacket. Just went out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just happy to play a part in Deray\u2019s success, even though we\u2019re going through this contract dispute right now.\n\nA contract dispute?\n\nYeah, man. I can\u2019t believe it, but he\u2019s really changed. He won\u2019t even acknowledge how big a role I\u2019ve played in his success. He signed a book deal and didn\u2019t offer me a percentage. Deray would be nothing without me. Nothing!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome on now. Nothing?\n\nI said what I said. I\u2019ve been buttoned up for too long. (Get it?) It\u2019s my turn now! When you think of Deray what do you think of? That\u2019s right. You think of me!\n\nActually, I think of Black Lives Matter.\n\nFair point. But Deray didn\u2019t help create Black Lives Matter. He didn\u2019t help organize a single chapter. Have you ever said: \u201cBlack Lives Matter?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, I have.\n\nSo why don\u2019t you have a book deal?\n\nWell, actually...\n\nBecause you don\u2019t have me!\n\nI\u2019m the reason he got to sit on the couch with Katy Perry. I\u2019m the reason he could quit his job to become a full-time activist! I\u2019m the reason he could ... well, I don\u2019t have any more example of any progress he\u2019s caused, which is exactly my point!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe ain\u2019t Martin Luther King. He ain\u2019t even Martin Lawrence! (Although they do kinda look alike.) He\u2019s the nigga in the blue vest! I\u2019m the king now!\n\nCome on, man. Don\u2019t ruin a friendship over money.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about acknowledgment. What about me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou think I don\u2019t have life goals? You think I don\u2019t want to settle down with a nice trenchcoat one day and have a family of my own? Maybe buy myself some sleeves? A hood?\n\nI called you over here to make this announcement publicly:\n\nUnless DeRay and I can come to some agreement, This is my last protest season with Mr. McKesson. If we can\u2019t work something out, I\u2019ll be a free agent this summer and available for hire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if you\u2019re upset about white supremacy, and don\u2019t want to wear a hoodie with a logo all up in your Instagram video, all up on your Facebook newsfeed taking all your likes, holla at ya boy. I can work weddings, bar mitzvahs, funerals, tv shows, red carpet appearances and anywhere white people need the conscious black person du jour to validate their wokeness.\n\nHit me up on twitter at @DeraysBlueVest.\n\nSo do you think your relationship with DeRay is salvageable?\n\nI hope so. He\u2019s still my best friend. We go together like Superman and his cape. Like P. Diddy and white suits. Like T\u2019Challa and his chain. But if D.M. doesn\u2019t come with the vibranium coins...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poweer of the blue vest will be strrrript aweh.\n\nOk. I got it.

The proposal is authored by a representative who has long been a vocal defender of the Confederate flag and another Republican lawmaker who said that the victims of the Charleston, S.C., church massacre \u201cwaited to be shot.\u201d There is only one problem with the plan:\n\nSouth Carolina didn\u2019t have any black Confederate soldiers.\n\nOn Dec. 13, state Reps. Bill Chumley (R-Spartanburg) and Mike Burns (R-Greenville) filed a proposed piece of legislation to recognize African Americans who fought for the Confederate States of America in the bloodiest conflict in the nation\u2019s history. The lawmakers are seeking to form a commission that would eventually build a monument dedicated to black Confederate soldiers, according to The State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut experts say there is no evidence that black soldiers fought alongside Southern whites in the War Between the States. \u201cIn all my years of research, I can say I have seen no documentation of black South Carolina soldiers fighting for the Confederacy,\u201d said historian Walter Edgar, author of South Carolina: A History. Edgar also served for 32 years as director of the University of South Carolina\u2019s Institute for Southern Studies. \u201cIn fact, when secession came, the state turned down free [blacks] who wanted to volunteer because they didn\u2019t want armed persons of color,\u201d Edgar added.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Archives and History has no records of black soldiers receiving combat pay during the Confederacy, according to The State. Documents show that blacks served as cooks, buglers and body servants, but not as combat soldiers. Confederate law banned blacks from owning firearms until 1865, the very end of the Civil War, when blacks fought in states like Virginia and Texas but not South Carolina. South Carolina\u2019s laws even prohibited mixed-race citizens from serving in combat duty and showed a complete rejection of any nonwhite armed participation in the Confederacy\u2019s cause.\n\nChumley and Burns basically responded to those facts with a Caucasian version of, \u201cYeah, but still ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Chumley, when asked about the lack of evidence. \u201cIf they served in the Confederate Army, they deserve to be recognized.\u201d The politicians also filed a companion bill that would form a commission to construct a plan to teach the state\u2019s public school students about African Americans\u2019 participation in the Civil War.\n\nBoth lawmakers voted against the removal of the symbol of white supremacy from the Statehouse following Dylann Roof\u2019s 2015 mass murder at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Burns famously wrote an op-ed dripping with white supremacist tears for USA Today on why removing the Confederate flag was a mistake. And during the debate on the flag removal, Chumley said that the nine victims \u201cwaited their turn to be shot.\u201d\n\nI have come up with a solution to the controversy that should make everyone happy. If South Carolina wants to build a monument to people who never existed, just make the monument invisible, too. In fact, I\u2019ve already built it. Maybe you can\u2019t see it, but trust me\u2014just like the black soldiers of the Confederacy\u2014it\u2019s there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee?

Paris Fashion Week ended with natural hair trending strongly on the runways, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s show was no exception. Along with showcasing natural hair, designer Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re returned to the house of Louis Vuitton this season after a long absence from the runways and showed his own variation of the primary colors in patchwork patterns that appeared in designer collections on almost every Fall/Winter 2018-2019 catwalk. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s interpretation showed up on corset belts that are a sexy and simple-to-wear update for a fall wardrobe.\n\nBlack against primary or neon colors is also a directional color theme for fall. Vuitton illustrated a prevailing mood in fashion that sexy has its place, but only if it also somehow says power. For instance, notice a flounce of details on one side of the shirt tucked into a high-waisted belt, so as not to be over-the-top (no pun intended) sexy. And elements of menswear like tweed were feminized with beaded trims and ruffles, creating a capelet effect as a pretty version of padded power shoulders.\n\nOpera-length gloves for both day and night were another fixture in the accessories category this season. Whether in satin, leather or neoprene, they quickly elevate an outfit to fashionista status with the snap of the wrist.\n\nMeanwhile, athleisure is fading away from the fashion footrace, with sneakers being outpaced by chunky-but-elegant heels. Take note, fashion lovers: Bold straps also pick up the patchwork theme on shoes and boots. At Vuitton, other microtrends that added up to a big new look for fall were stripes, lariats and shoulder-duster earrings with statement pearls on delicate chains.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images 1 / 10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can check out the full Louis Vuitton presentation below and let The Glow Up know which looks you love.

They all have originated from Murfreesboro, Tenn. My great-great-grandfather was named Jesse Tillage and was born in 1850, and on all documents he is listed as mulatto and born in Virginia.\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised that after I took the Ancestry.com DNA test, I\u2019ve had several relative matches to non-African Americans from that area. I reached out to the relative that had the highest probability and was pleasantly surprised at how excited she was that I reached out. She is a 75-year-old retired professor and historian, and both her grandparents were direct descendants of two Tilledge/Tillage brothers. In fact, there has been a published book that details the families from the original husband and wife that settled in Gloucester Point, Va., in 1705. I\u2019m excited about the reconnection with the white Tillages, and I\u2019m planning a visit with them.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m still on the trail of Jesse Tillage. I\u2019d like to know the best way to narrow which Tillage slave owner was the direct relative. I\u2019ve concluded that many of the Tillages who are listed as mulatto have to be close relatives. One was Coleman Tillage: I traced him back to who I think his father was (Coleman R. Tillage, a slave owner recorded in the 1850 Slave Schedule) and found out when the younger Coleman enlisted in the 37th Colored Infantry during the Civil War. \u2014Keith Tillage\n\nYour journey to discover your roots has been a remarkable one, based on what you describe. As Professor Gates noted in a previous column, the average African American has roughly one-quarter European ancestry, according to the range of estimates by major DNA testing companies. However, because of the dislocation caused by the slave trade and the long-standing American taboo of acknowledging blood ties across the color line, most black people in this country do not know the identity of their white relatives (much less who their kin are on the African continent). Some are understandably content to let those blood ties remain unknown because they were often created through the rape and coercion of enslaved African-American women. Others, like you and academic leader Ruth Simmons, are willing to confront the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimmons, who is president of Prairie View A&M University and past president of Brown University, was reconnected with a descendant of her first white ancestor, a Texas man who enslaved her great-grandfather, in a 2012 episode of Professor Gates\u2019 PBS television show Finding Your Roots. The distant cousins, black and white, approached the meeting with openness while acknowledging that older members of their respective families would have frowned upon it. The Boston Globe quotes her:\n\n\u201cWe can accept the fact that slavery resulted in this kind of mixture\u2014often involuntary on the part of slaves\u2014and that we have a whole country filled with people who are attached to each other in these invisible ways.\u201d But, she added, \u201cwithout the knowledge of it influencing how they see their lives and how they see the country, that\u2019s the sad part of it.\u201d\n\nLike Simmons, you have a unique opportunity to work with your white kin to uncover your common history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting With Jesse and Working Backward\n\nThe 1920 U. S. census recorded Jesse Tillage and his wife, Mollie, residing in Rutherford County, Tenn., with a grandson, Robert Tillage. Jesse was born about 1855 in Tennessee. The household was directly next to the household of a Robert Tillage, who was likely their son, born in Tennessee about 1898. In 1880, Jesse Tillage was living in Rutherford County, Tenn., with his wife, Mary. According to the record, they were both mulatto, and Jesse was born about 1850 in Tennessee. Both of his parents were born in Virginia.\n\nJesse Tillage died on July 2, 1920, in Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tenn. His death record incorrectly states that he was born in 1864, but this could have been an error by the informant. His gravestone in Evergreen Graveyard (the burial location given on the death record) records his birth as 1849, which is much closer to what we know about him. What is interesting about the death record is that his mother was given as Sallie Mason, who was born in Virginia, and his father was unknown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis wife, Mollie, died Dec. 20, 1934, in Murfreesboro and is buried in the same cemetery. Her death record indicates that her parents were Harry Mentor and Nancy Varnes, both of Bedford County. It is always good to note information on records for relatives, since they may contain more clues to help you work backward.\n\nSeeking the Connection to a Black Civil War Soldier\n\nCould Jesse have been associated with the slave owner Coleman R. Tillage? As you noted, Coleman R., who died in 1855, owned slaves in 1850 at James City, Va., though they were all female. Unfortunately, many of the records from James City, Va., were housed in Richmond and were destroyed in 1865 when Richmond burned. Because of this, you might not be able to locate his probate file, though you could contact the county clerk to see if the office has any records or substitute records that may be able to help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, you may be able to piece together some of Coleman\u2019s personal estate through tax records that survived. Personal property tax lists may give you an indication of how many slaves he owned each year, which may help you account for the birth of your Jesse. These are available on microfilm through a Family History Library or at the Virginia State Library.\n\nYou mentioned another Coleman Tillage who was African American and served in the Civil War. Based on his service record, Coleman Tillage served in Company E of the 37th United States Colored Infantry (via Fold3; subscription required), which was organized in Norfolk, Va., in 1864. To learn more about the 37th USCI and other units of black Civil War soldiers, download a copy of William Dobak\u2019s Freedom by the Sword: The U.S. Colored Troops, 1862-1867 (pdf).\n\nHe was 22 years old when he enlisted on Dec. 15, 1863, placing his birth about 1841. He survived the war and mustered out of services at the expiration of his term on Dec. 14, 1866, at Charleston, S.C. This Coleman Tillage filed for a pension on Dec. 27, 1884, and died Sept. 9, 1915, at Fuguay Springs, N.C.\u2014Application No. 528.838, Certificate No. 1086.878. You could order a copy of the pension file to see if his application contains any more details about his service, his family or his life during slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may also find some more clues in the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau records. A Martha Tillage and her child were recorded as receiving rations in the Norfolk, Va., area with a notation \u201cHus (Coleman 3rd NC).\u201d The book is not clear on the dates, though the beginning of his includes lists of rations received in 1862. Likewise, a Mary Tillage at Glasgow, Va., was 9 years old and destitute, receiving rations in 1865, placing her birth about 1856.\n\nThere is also an undated letter inquiring about what happened to Coleman Tillage, who hadn\u2019t been heard from since right before the fall of the Confederate capital of Richmond in 1865. The inquiry was initiated by Coleman\u2019s mother, Mary Tillidge, and was put forward by J.H. Remington, inquiring whether he was alive or dead at the last muster of Company E, 37th U.S.C. Troops. This letter is certainly related to the Coleman Tillage who served in the United States Colored Troops, and the ration records are likely for a wife and child or another close relative. These were the only records we located in the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau papers with the surname Tillage.\n\nWhile it is possible that this soldier, Coleman Tillage, was associated with the slave owner named Coleman R. Tillage, nothing we found on either man helps us in determining how your Jesse Tillage relates to them. We know your Jesse Tillage settled in Murfreesboro, Rutherford, which is quite a distance from James City, Va. With the clue that Jesse\u2019s mother was named Sallie Mason, we searched for other Masons in Rutherford County who could be relatives. It is possible that Jesse was sold to a slave owner in Rutherford prior to the end of slavery, but he carried the Tillage name with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes Jesse\u2019s Mother Provide the Link?\n\nThe only Sallie Mason we located in Rutherford County was white and did not seem to be a likely fit for Jesse\u2019s mother because we could trace her forward with her own family. However, with the Mason surname in mind, we thought it interesting that Jesse Tillage was residing very near a John Mason in 1910 who was just three years younger than \u201cJessie\u201d and was also recorded as mulatto in the census. This John Mason was in District 9 of Rutherford in 1880. It seems a high probability that this is the same John Mason who was residing in Rutherford in 1870 in the household of Richard Mason, who was born about 1830. In 1880 the census recorded that Richard Mason was born in Virginia about 1829, which we noted because we know that the parents of your Jesse Tillage were born in Virginia.\n\nWe then looked for slave owners in Rutherford County who had a slave that might match your Jesse Tillage\u2019s description. We noted a slave owner in 1860 named Jos. Mason in District 3, Rutherford, Tenn., who owned a male slave born about 1849 who could be a match for your Jesse Tillage. There was also a slave owner name W.N. Mason in District 2, Rutherford, Tenn., who owned 20 slaves in 1860, one of which was a 13-year-old boy described as mulatto who may also be a match. You will likely want to see if you can locate any probate, tax or land records for these men, since they may reveal more about their slaves. You may also want to see if they have any relation to the Tillage family in Virginia, which may suggest that they transferred slaves to each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince you know from your DNA results that you relate to the white Tillage family, it seems likely that your Jesse Tillage was a descendant of one of the white slave-owning Tillage families. This may be why he kept the name. It is not impossible that he settled in Rutherford County, Tenn., following emancipation.\n\nHowever, since this is quite a distance from where the white Tillage family resided in Virginia, and you know that Jesse\u2019s mother\u2019s surname was Mason, you may want to investigate the possibility that he was taken to Tennessee prior to emancipation as part of a slave sale or inheritance. You could start by asking your newfound white Tillage cousin if she knows of any connection in her background to a family with the surname Mason, or an association with Rutherford County.\n\nGood luck with your reunion and your continued search for answers!\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and founding director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.

Full stop.\n\nHe's not paid to beat women. He's paid to kick a football. The former has not affected the latter. The New York Giants still employ Brown even though they know Brown is a woman-beater. It isn't a secret because Brown admitted to being an abuser after a 2015 arrest. Brown's former wife, Molly, the subject of Brown's aggression, turned over 165 pages of documents to the King County (Wash.) Sheriff's Office after Brown's arrest. Those documents were recently sent to several news outlets and include journal entries by Brown admitting to abusing his former wife.\n\n\"I became an abuser and hurt Molly physically, emotionally and verbally,\" Brown wrote, the New York Times reports. \"I viewed myself as God basically and she was my slave. I carried an overwhelming sense of entitlement because I put money higher than God and I used it as a power tool.\"\n\nThe documents also indicate that Brown violated a restraining order and detail three 911 calls Molly Brown made during their relationship. Brown's former wife also says that she was abused at least 20 times during their marriage.\n\nAfter Brown's May 2015 arrest involving the incident with his wife, the NFL conducted a 10-month investigation. The league now says it didn't have those documents when it concluded its investigation. The NFL's verdict on Brown's incident: a one-game suspension. One. Game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about the brotherhood of the NFL, which might only be comparable to the blue wall of silence; this also is about the racial dynamics of what constitutes news and suspension in the league. This is about how punishments are doled out and who's being hurt.\n\nWhile the focus these days seems to be on the dozen or so players who have knelt, locked arms or raised a fist during the national anthem in protest of the police violence against unarmed men, women and children, the NFL has habitually allowed violent offenders to remain in its league\u2014and tolerated and assisted them in doing so.\n\nMake no mistake about it; the NFL doesn't care about women. Don't let anything it does try to tell you differently. Despite all the pink, NFL-issued, breast-cancer-awareness garb and the great public relations push it made to show off the first female NFL referee\u2014in 2015!\u2014or the bulls\u2014t public service announcement it created around domestic violence, it\u2019s clear the NFL has never, ever cared about women and that some of the men it employs abuse them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Giants knew that Brown was an abuser, and Giants co-owner John Mara admitted such during an interview Thursday on WFAN in New York after the documents were released.\n\nMara noted how, during the Pro Bowl in Hawaii in January, Brown's children and his then-wife, Molly, had to be moved by NFL security when a drunken Brown showed up and began pounding on her door.\n\n\"He admitted to us that he\u2019s abused his wife in the past. I think what\u2019s a little unclear is the extent of that,\" Mara said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, sir. I think what's a little \"unclear\" is why the talk out of New York this week has been about Odell Beckham Jr.'s celebration taking the focus off the team, and not that inside the locker room is an admitted abuser who once believed himself to be God and his wife a slave. Didn't have all the documents? Doesn't matter. The documents merely confirmed what Giants owners already knew: that Brown was and has been a woman-beater.\n\nMara even added: \"We\u2019re obviously disturbed by some of the things we read. There\u2019s no excuse ever for any type of domestic violence.\" Except there is, since you all knew that Brown was a confessed abuser and did nothing to stop it.\n\nI'm curious as to what the acceptable level of domestic abuse is in the NFL. Since the Giants owner knew that Brown was a woman-beater but just didn't know to what extent, I'm unclear as to what is the NFL's level of acceptable abuse, because the post keeps moving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeems like anything short of a videotaped assault is fair game. Defensive end Greg Hardy reportedly beat and threatened to kill his then girlfriend and continued playing in the NFL until the Dallas Cowboys figured out that he probably has some screws loose. Wide receiver Brandon Marshall has been arrested and charged four times in domestic incidents including a charge of misdemeanor battery against a girlfriend, yet he's still catching passes for the New York Jets. Linebacker Daryl Washington pleaded guilty to assaulting an ex-girlfriend in 2013, and he's still playing with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nSo, now that the news has broken, the NFL and the Giants have to take this on. The Giants announced that they would be leaving Brown in the U.S. while they travel to London to face the Los Angeles Rams. The Giants issued some ho-hum statement about how they were going to look into the new developments, but they probably won't do anything, and the league won't, either.\n\nBaltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith, who watched his mother be abused, took to Twitter to note, \"It's a shame that the NFL acts like it cares.\" He also added:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut let's keep the focus on Colin Kaepernick's silent protest during an anthem that was never written with us in mind. Let's keep acting as if the NFL doesn't have a domestic-abuse problem. Let's keep silent about what the NFL really doesn't want to discuss.\n\nStephen A. Crockett Jr. is a senior editor at The Root.

So tell me about yourself.\n\nYou know, I have the same story as everyone. I was born in the hood to a single mother who worked two jobs\u2014she was a reversible fleece. My father was the red leather jacket in the \u201cBeat it Video\u201d and never really came around much after he went on tour with Michael Jackson in \u201882. But before he transitioned, taught me that I could make a difference in this world.\n\nDid he pass away?\n\nNo, he went out of style, and they turned him into a couple of red leather bar seats.

He keeps me relevant, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how did you two meet?\n\nOh, man, D.M. and I go back a long way. We\u2019ve been rocking with each other long before Ferguson.

I\u2019m on my way to becoming a civil rights icon, like Malcolm X\u2019s skinny tie or Harriet Tubman\u2019s bonnet. And as far as the bulletproof thing goes, let\u2019s hope we never have to find out.\n\nI see. So why are you two so inseparable?\n\nFirst, you have to realize how useful I am. Have you ever seen DeRay? I mean ...we\u2019re cool and all, but he\u2019s like 112 pounds, soaking wet. You can\u2019t be at the protest looking like a mark. That\u2019s how you get \u201cgot.\u201d I give my nigga heft, you know what I\u2019m saying?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, the law of the streets is that you never mess with anyone wearing a puffy vest over a suit jacket because you don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to. Could be a hipster who stopped by Panera Bread on his way home from the office, or it could be a nigga with a strap. You never know.\n\nOne of the most underrated things about me is how much I have helped advance DeRay\u2019s career. A few years ago he was just some dude who was in Ferguson chanting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d along with thousands of others. Now he\u2019s one of the most recognizable faces in the movement. That\u2019s because of me.\n\nBecause of you?\n\nOf course it is. I\u2019m DeRay\u2019s brand, and there\u2019s nothing people love more than branding. I\u2019m arguably the most recognizable piece of clothing in the country. I\u2019m willing to bet that he\u2019s more recognizable than anyone in the movement. That\u2019s because of me. Have you ever heard about Deray\u2019s fresh, minty breath?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople say it smells pretty good.\n\nThat\u2019s because I always have a fresh pack of tic-tacs in my inside pocket, that\u2019s why!

I can\u2019t believe it, but he\u2019s really changed. He won\u2019t even acknowledge how big a role I\u2019ve played in his success. He signed a book deal and didn\u2019t offer me a percentage. Deray would be nothing without me. Nothing!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome on now. Nothing?\n\nI said what I said. I\u2019ve been buttoned up for too long. (Get it?) It\u2019s my turn now! When you think of Deray what do you think of? That\u2019s right. You think of me!\n\nActually, I think of Black Lives Matter.\n\nFair point. But Deray didn\u2019t help create Black Lives Matter. He didn\u2019t help organize a single chapter.

Paris Fashion Week ended with natural hair trending strongly on the runways, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s show was no exception. Along with showcasing natural hair, designer Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re returned to the house of Louis Vuitton this season after a long absence from the runways and showed his own variation of the primary colors in patchwork patterns that appeared in designer collections on almost every Fall/Winter 2018-2019 catwalk. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s interpretation showed up on corset belts that are a sexy and simple-to-wear update for a fall wardrobe.\n\nBlack against primary or neon colors is also a directional color theme for fall. Vuitton illustrated a prevailing mood in fashion that sexy has its place, but only if it also somehow says power. For instance, notice a flounce of details on one side of the shirt tucked into a high-waisted belt, so as not to be over-the-top (no pun intended) sexy. And elements of menswear like tweed were feminized with beaded trims and ruffles, creating a capelet effect as a pretty version of padded power shoulders.\n\nOpera-length gloves for both day and night were another fixture in the accessories category this season. Whether in satin, leather or neoprene, they quickly elevate an outfit to fashionista status with the snap of the wrist.\n\nMeanwhile, athleisure is fading away from the fashion footrace, with sneakers being outpaced by chunky-but-elegant heels. Take note, fashion lovers: Bold straps also pick up the patchwork theme on shoes and boots. At Vuitton, other microtrends that added up to a big new look for fall were stripes, lariats and shoulder-duster earrings with statement pearls on delicate chains.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images 1 / 10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can check out the full Louis Vuitton presentation below and let The Glow Up know which looks you love.

I hate it when my mortgage company sends me an email letting me know my payment is due on the first of each month. It\u2019s set to autopay, but I ALWAYS consider disabling that option and paying it on, like, the 14th JUST because they\u2019re yapping about me paying a bill that I ALREADY planned to pay. Put a pin in this\u2014we\u2019ll come back to it.\n\nCurrently, Roy Moore of the state of Alabama is running for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He is also a man accused of sexual misconduct who had a thing for young girls when he was in his 30s. Chances are that he still\u2014allegedly\u2014does now, but with his much higher profile, he\u2019s had to put a clamp on those (alleged) perversions.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it\u2019s a pretty easy case to get a guy out of there. In a vacuum, explaining to anybody that hey, this guy who is running for office tends to go after teenage girls and here is the evidence or, at the very least, the very damning indications should be enough to make most folks think twice about electing that person into office. Again, it should be. But we live in 2017; Donald Trump is our president and the White House has effectively endorsed a man with a super-questionable past for elected office. I can\u2019t even call it white-people shit.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem that\u2019s happening on the ground in Alabama (and back to that pin): Southerners HATE being told what to do by elitist Northerners, and the media is constantly falling into the Northern-elite bucket. I recently spent Thanksgiving in Huntsville, Ala., the city that\u2019s home to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center and Redstone Arsenal military installation. It\u2019s a city full of engineers and individuals involved in the technology industry. Stereotypically, it\u2019s the more educated part of the state.\n\nYet and still, I saw signs for Roy Moore all over the place and heard his ads on radio stations constantly. And I\u2019ll be willing to bet that while many folks won\u2019t be voting for him for obvious reasons, a significant number will JUST because they do not like being told that they\u2019re wrong to support their candidate AND because it\u2019s the media telling them so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is why I think that on Dec. 12, Alabama will elect Roy Moore to the U.S. Senate DESPITE the mounting allegations of his penchant for young girls. And I don\u2019t even think only Republicans will vote for him. I think there will be some Democrats, caught up in preserving their RIGHT to vote for who they want, that will also cast their vote for him.\n\nIt\u2019s that whole \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d bullshit that so many in the South like to hold on to as the justification for attempting to secede from the Union and causing the Civil War. It wasn\u2019t about slavery; heavens no. It was about the preservation of the state\u2019s right to govern itself. You see it in the same selfish grip on racist symbols of the South.\n\nFor many of us Southerners, both white and black, we\u2019ve passed by so many of those statues and symbols and never paid them any mind. But as soon as people did start paying attention and musing, \u201cHey, these symbols reflect a dark past and we shouldn\u2019t have the government endorsing and sponsoring these things,\u201d all hell broke loose and people on both sides of the political aisle started giving a fuck about symbols nobody but a few cared about for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNobody goes daily to pay homage to statues of Confederate generals, but once they started coming down, you\u2019d think every (mostly white) Southerner woke up and drove to a statue of Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis and specifically tipped his hat to it.\n\nBut that\u2019s Southern pride. And Roy Moore and his impending election to the U.S. Senate will be another in a line of Southerners cutting off their own noses to spite their faces. So what, folks who drive Priuses (Northerners) are calling his campaign what it is: an (alleged) sexual deviant who got caught with his proverbial pants down after lauding the ideals of morality and the conservative Christian way over the state of Alabama, a state with enough issues as is.\n\nMy colleague Jason Johnson posited that Alabama will elect Moore because they want to keep Republicans in power. And while there is some facet of that at play, I think the larger issue is one that speaks more to the culture war that exists in the heads of many down South: that Northerners think they\u2019re better than us and think they know our politics better than we do. Fuck \u2019em.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe South has long been judged by the rest of the country over a great many things, and a lot of it is rightly terrible. The South has prided itself on its problematic history and stood tall against anybody trying to tell it that its history is fucked up. White Southerners are the worst about pride and heritage.\n\nMany would rather see the worst kind of white man rise to office than concede to anybody else that perhaps they\u2019ve shit the bed one too many times. That\u2019s what\u2019s at play here. The Northern media is shitting all over Roy Moore (rightly), and many down South don\u2019t like it one bit. The Washington establishment (as so many of his ads refer to it) is trying to force its ideologies on Alabama. And they won\u2019t be going for that. Not in Alabama the beautiful.\n\nI hope that I\u2019m wrong. I hope that on Dec. 13, anybody other than Roy Moore is the new senator from Alabama. But I will not be surprised one bit if he\u2019s the choice and if it\u2019s not even that close. But I read the news and I see how many people think it\u2019s idiotic that he\u2019s even still in the race and, well, I\u2019m sure that most in the state feel like it\u2019s their monkey and their circus, and they\u2019ll decide what to do with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how a state like Alabama elects a man like Roy Moore to national public office: Outsiders and Northerners tell them not to do it.", "keywords": ["white", "office", "think", "state", "folks", "seat", "win", "moore", "thats", "symbols", "alabamas", "roy", "alabama", "senate", "south", "told", "dont", "southern"], "polarity": 0.06340372854658567, "subjectivity": 0.4891621923050494},

Riley was right there.\n\n\n\nOf course, Barack was looking at wife Michelle, the woman he loves. Meanwhile, Riley was gazing out at a room full of women he loves, including longtime former boss Oprah Winfrey. The year was 2005, and Riley was producing the Legends Ball at Oprah\u2019s custom-built private Santa Barbara, Calif., estate, appropriately named \u201cthe Promised Land.\u201d\n\nThis, and many equally fabulous and intimate moments like it, reflect the impact of women\u2014especially black women\u2014on Riley\u2019s life. After 30 years in television, as a producer for both Oprah\u2019s and Wendy Williams\u2019 talk shows, he is now the author of the new book That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me. Riley says that our former president\u2019s words echo the feeling he has held for black women since he was \u201cin the womb.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s book is a tale of growing up different. His father was in the Air Force, moving his family to far-flung locales like Tokyo before eventually settling in Valdosta, Ga., in the 1970s. Growing up an oft-uprooted military brat and trying to fit in was not easy, especially as a gay child in a place and time that was not so accepting.\n\nThankfully, Riley had a mother who understood how to nourish her son\u2019s soul with outings to the opera and symphony. But while mother and son shared many conversations about culture, \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was still the unspoken word at home. Instead, Riley found companionship and validation in the songs and stage talents of women he admired. Listening to divas uplifted him and led him to find a path to both himself and the #BlackGirlMagic heaven he dreamed of finding. He would be their angel.\n\nWomen in the arts and entertainment were the muses from my childhood who made me feel better when I was an unsure little boy who didn\u2019t quite know how to live in his truth. These women could tear my heart out with a melody or a soliloquy in a movie, appealing to the outcast I sometimes felt like in my search for acceptance.\n\nThe black gay man\u2019s search for acceptance is a timely conversation, as evidenced by last week\u2019s controversy after Patti LaBelle revealed to Bravo TV\u2019s Andy Cohen that Luther Vandross\u2019 decision to remain closeted all of his life was so as not to disappoint his mother. It\u2019s a subject that touches Riley deeply. Although his own mother understood that her son might be gay, there was a deafening silence on the matter between the two of them. To spare her feelings, Riley chose not to come out until after his mother\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in this current political climate is a reversal of empathy,\u201d Riley says. It\u2019s the reason that he feels the timing is right for this memoir, despite print being on a sharp decline, with even celebrity-centric books struggling to make it into the hands of readers hungry for content about black life.\n\nDorpie Books, the publisher of That\u2019s What Friends Are For, is a black-owned and -operated imprint and a new model of publishing that puts the power in the hands of the audience, allowing them to crowdfund the projects they want to read. It addresses a dire need for publishers to print and promote books by authors of color\u2014one recently expressed by celebrity and new author Gabrielle Union.\n\nThis coming-of-age story features both jewels of personal wisdom and gems from the entertainment world. Riley\u2019s memories illuminate the kindness and humanity of stars from Lena Horne to Beyonc\u00e9, while bringing to light the questions and struggles of many in the LGBTQ community with tenderness and humor. In this excerpt, Riley recounts:\n\nBy high school, I had the jaded notion that there was a hard road ahead that maybe I couldn\u2019t handle, reconciling my insides to what was going on outside. I wondered if I would ever come out as a gay man. Would I continue to go the course that society wanted me to? Could I marry a woman? These were big questions I had to start asking myself while peers were taking next steps into their intimate relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually Riley did fall in love\u2014with the friendship he perceived between Patti Labelle and Dionne Warwick while watching Sisters in the Name of Love, the 1986 AIDS fundraising concert they hosted on HBO with fellow diva Gladys Knight. What he saw between them on-screen became his real-life standard for what friends should be to one another and the good that friendship can bring into the world.\n\nIt was a crush that would become a career. \u201cBefore I knew it, there I was in the TV business, either interviewing my favorite celebrity women or producing their projects,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pages of That\u2019s What Friends Are For read like a producer\u2019s personal diary of Hollywood glitterati, filled with behind-the-scenes photos and very personal anecdotes about the strong women, from activists to athletes, who helped light his journey to both personal and professional success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley\u2019s prose sparkles when he describes the \u201cenergy that comes off of Beyonc\u00e9 or Janet Jackson when I touch their hand to greet them,\u201d and he recounts so many priceless moments, like Queen Bey singing him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on a trip to Manila, Philippines; or the interview he landed with the Boss Miss Ross and Motown founder Berry Gordy at the opening night of Broadway\u2019s Motown the Musical. And then there are the poignant ones, like when he shared tears with Warwick over the tragic loss of her little cousin, singer Whitney Houston.\n\nAt the core of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me lies a highly personal mission: \u201cIf just one gay kid can find a spot of inspiration in this text, along with others who can give support to the LGBTQ community, my efforts will have been worth it.\u201d Because after all, that\u2019s what friends are for.\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Preorders of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me are available now through Dec. 22 at Dorpie Books ($35):\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["meet", "legendary", "friends", "patrick", "inspire", "personal", "black", "thats", "gay", "mother", "riley", "women", "books", "bffs"], "polarity": 0.17496914121914128, "subjectivity": 0.4576360126360127},

On Sunday at Vanity Fair\u2019s Oscar party, McKesson\u2019s post-meme Patagonia Blue Vest was spotted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t expect everyone to be a Blue Vest expert\u2014I understand others cultivate more fruitful obsessions to fill the slow days of their lives. I started following McKesson in 2015 wanting to know not only his political movements after the Ferguson protests, but also his personal commitment to a single Blue Vest.\n\n\n\nEventually, when McKesson declared he was going to run for mayor of Baltimore, I was met with more questions than answers: How many versions of the Blue Vest did he own? If there is only one, what is McKesson\u2019s cleaning routine? Does he simply use a washer and dryer? Laundromat? Toothbrush, perhaps? All of these thoughts eventually led back to a simper question: How often does the Blue Vest get washed?\n\n\n\nThree years ago McKesson sent a simple tweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne washing, one patch. Okay, okay.\n\nA late 2015 update I uncovered puts McKesson\u2019s vest at one wash and two patch updates, in total. This particular visit saw the addition of an orange stripe that is clearly in reference to a traffic cone. I\u2019ll be referring to this particular orange strip of fabric as Caution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2016, the Baltimore Sun reported that McKesson had washed Blue Vest only two times since his rise to fame. That puts my count at two washes, two patches.\n\nThis July 2017 tweet now puts my reporting of Blue Vest at two washes and three patches. McKesson even joked about Blue Vest needing a wash. How must Blue Vest & Caution feel, knowing their owner would rather put them in hands of strangers with needles, than give them a loving cleaning?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA December 2017 tweet confirms that Blue Vest & Caution got a new zipper, no wash.\n\nCould it be that I was wrong and McKesson has in fact been treating his favorite partners in resistance with the proper tender loving care? As it turns out, yes. McKesson has been doing it right all along. Here is Patagonia\u2019s stance on product cleanliness (emphasis my own):\n\nWash your gear only when it\u2019s absolutely necessary, you\u2019ll conserve water, minimize wear and tear on your garments in the process). Even your most-used outerwear should only need a full wash occasionally. If it\u2019s caked with dirt (and we hope it will be), consider using a rag or sponge to spot clean rather than putting it through a machine cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatagonia, an outdoorsy brand that\u2019s incredibly woke to the suffering of planet Earth, is pro-dirt. Even layers of dirt. It\u2019s disheartening to know that Blue Vest & Caution are certainly more familiar with the sound of industrial sewing machines than clean running water, but maybe they like it that way. My thoughts and prayers remain with them as they seemingly await another year till bathing.\n\n\n\nJezebel has reached out to McKesson for comment and will update if we hear back.

Shoulders, one of the most important details of this fashion season, were treated with feathers, luscious gobs of fake fur or appliqu\u00e9d felt leaves cascading down the sleeves that fluttered gently as models padded over the faux leaves that also carpeted the runway.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images 1 / 9\n\nGold boots, lurex stockings, supersized two-tone scarves in an autumn blaze of burnt orange and carmine red, and fingerless fuchsia or gold opera gloves added a shock of color against black, a very strong trend we\u2019ve been seeing on the runways for fall.\n\nChanel Fall-Winter 2018 Paris runway show (FF Channel via YouTube)\n\nIn contrast, Alexander McQueen is a label that pushes the boundaries of fashion with a darkly romantic vision that makes both women and fashion more beautiful, and this season was no exception. Designer Sarah Burton showed primary brights against black butterfly prints, sharp tuxedos lined in brilliant hues like red, and deconstructed leather jackets that made the tried-and-true wardrobe staple into a truly modern, investment-worthy addition.\n\nAlexander McQueen Fall/Winter 2018-2019 Paris runway show (ChannelFF via YouTube)\n\nMilitary jackets were transformed into eveningwear as they were cleverly extended into expertly cut tailcoats. And long before there were \u201cwaist trainers,\u201d McQueen has made corsets like no other designer, this time sculpted out of leather. But it was the shoulders that were the focus (The Glow Up has said it in nearly every fashion review this season, and it holds true again for this collection), with pleated silk shoulders blown up like clouds of cotton candy, crafted with the kind of couture skills capable of transforming pure whimsy into complete sophistication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually lovely was the diverse runway-model lineup, an array of skin tones from ebony to ivory, and the surprise sole addition of a plus-size model, one of the few full-figured women on the catwalk this season.

They say they\u2019ve accrued even more support from their fellow revisionist idiots colleagues in the Statehouse, according to WHNS-TV.\n\nRep. Josiah Magnuson told the news outlet that he supports the bill to erect the new monument and may even consider co-sponsoring it.\n\n\u201cI believe that our history brings us together when it\u2019s presented properly,\u201d said Magnuson, who is currently supporting a bill that whitewashes the Confederacy behind enslaved black soldiers.\n\n\u201cI believe that our heritage of defending our state can tell us where we need to go in the future,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuh. Josiah, if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say it sounds like you\u2019re advocating secession. Flashback Friday, indeed.\n\nThe problem, of course, with memorializing black Confederate soldiers is that they were literally forced into supporting the Confederate cause ... because slavery.\n\nBut since it\u2019s 2017 and we need history professors to explain the most basic of concepts to us, let\u2019s hear from a South Carolinian history professor who spoke to WHNS (because none of these grits-for-brains lawmakers seem to be listening).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about serving the Confederacy, I think it\u2019s important to make a distinction between those who shouldered arms, which is almost nobody, because it was illegal, and those maybe around the battle sites who were acting as laborers or teamsters, or serving as assistants or servants,\u201d Dr. Stephen O\u2019Neill, who teaches history at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., told Fox.\n\n\n\nThis, of course, has been well-covered by Civil War historians. African-American-studies professor John Stauffer pointed out in his explainer for The Root in 2015 that some enslaved black soldiers were forced to fight\u2014at risk of death.\n\n\u201cConfederates impressed slaves as laborers and at times forced them to fight. In effect, they put guns to their heads, forcing them to fire on Yankees,\u201d Stauffer wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Civil War historian Kevin Levin told Newsweek, the focus on black Confederates isn\u2019t new and is part of a clear attempt to whitewash the Confederacy\u2019s defense of slavery. Levin called the proposed South Carolina monuments \u201cpart of a larger attempt to reinterpret the Confederacy to separate it from slavery and white supremacy.\u201d\n\nOr, as O\u2019Neill told Fox, the proposed monument implies that black Americans were \u201csatisfied enough with the institution of slavery\u201d or were fighting for their \u201chomeland\u201d\u2014two dangerous lies that these South Carolina lawmakers think could heal their state.\n\nAmong them is Rep. Mike Burns, who told WHNS that he hopes that his bullshit, ahistorical monument could serve as an example in the clashes over Confederate monuments nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt could be a good thing for our state and be a model for other states who are suffering through these same issues,\u201d Burns said.\n\nRead more at WHNS-TV.", "keywords": ["sc", "state", "monument", "soldiers", "senators", "war", "black", "history", "slavery", "facts", "south", "told", "confederacy", "confederates", "damned", "experts"], "polarity": 0.0020265151515151485, "subjectivity": 0.4343939393939394},

Since the age of 13, her love of beauty, business entrepreneurship, wanderlust and a hustle that just won\u2019t quit have made her one to watch. The Glow Up girl caught up with the avid traveler and founder of Superstar Nail Lacquer to find out what inspires her, how she\u2019s nailing the beauty game (and several other burgeoning businesses) and where this entrepreneurial prodigy is headed next:\n\nAriana Pierce: When I was a young girl, my mom would get me a lot of books and Mary Kate and Ashley videos that had to do with travel: Passport to Paris, Holiday in the Sun and When in Rome, to name a few. I decided then that it would be a part of my career one day; I just had to figure out how.\n\nThe Glow Up: Traveling while black can be an interesting experience.\n\nAP: For me, traveling to South America, many times, they assume my friends and I are from a Spanish-speaking country or the Caribbean and will go out of their way to make sure we have a great experience. Of course, there are times when you have those people who are just rude. Don\u2019t let them ruin your fun\u2014you\u2019re there to enjoy life and take in the beauty of the world and culture around you.\n\nArianaPierce.com ArianaPierce.com SuperStarNailLacquer.com ArianaPierce.com 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What beauty essential would you never travel without?\n\nAP: I for sure take a bottle of Superstar Nail Lacquer with me, my diffuser and a small bottle of Thieves Oil. It\u2019s an essential oil that keeps my skin clear, and it helps to keep my immune system up.\n\nTGU: Favorite city for beauty treatments?\n\nAP: My favorite cities in the United States for beauty treatments are New York City and Los Angeles. Whenever I\u2019m there, I love visiting the spas, as people in these cities are very into self-care and leading healthy lifestyles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t been to South Korea, the capital of skin care.\n\nTGU: Favorite city for fashion?\n\nAP: My favorite city for fashion in the United States is New York. I love how edgy and diverse the fashion is. It\u2019s all about creativity and owning your look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: How did your passions for beauty and travel become a business?\n\nAP: I started [conceptualizing] my business at 13. I wanted to help women everywhere feel beautiful, stylish and safe. Fast-forward to 17 years old: Freshman year at Michigan State, I wanted to launch myself in the beauty and cosmetic industries, so that\u2019s when I started. Being new to college and starting a business, I was always working.\n\nPhoto: Ariana Pierce (ArianaPierce.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Career highs and lows?\n\nAP: Lows of my career happened more so in my teens and 20s. I remember being in a room with people three times my age and feeling a bit out of place. Not only did age play a factor, but being a black woman in the cosmetic industry was something that was very new at that time.\n\nWhen I launched my online store at SuperstarNailLacquer.com, I did not post photos of me on my site so that people would not judge my product by a skin color, but by quality. I would get major calls from other brands wanting to collaborate with Superstar on some pretty amazing projects. It was disappointing to find that once these brands met with me in person, the deal went south for what they called \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter so many times of experiencing disappointing outcomes, I decided that I would not let this stop me, so I began to study my industry, educating myself so I would know more than many of those I was meeting with. Over time, my business gained such success online; big brands couldn\u2019t ignore me any longer. One thing I learned from this is that no matter how others treat you, there is no room for excuses. If you put your mind, will and heart into your business, you can be successful.\n\n[My] career high was being featured on Forbes\u2019 Business of Influence series. Forbes is one of those things that had always been on my dream list.\n\nTGU: How do you manage to have a successful brand and a life at the same time?\n\n\n\nAP: It\u2019s all about scheduling time to do what you want and at the same time have a successful business. During the week, I make sure to grind it out in my business. I\u2019m flexible with my days, but I try [to] take Saturday and Sunday to spend with my family and friends. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been able to keep going without burning out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What are your business goals?\n\nAP: Continue to grow Superstar Nail Lacquer and sell it, but stay on as creative director while I focus more on my other brands, and also coaching young people to level-up in their businesses. I\u2019ve created courses to help people grow their brands online [and] start profitable blogs so they can live their dream life now\u2014not later.

And yes, I've seen ODB and his homeboys doing choreographed dance moves. I've seen photos of him and friends shirtless, standing close to one another.\n\nAnd yes, I've even seen the one of him in the rainbow underwear.\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. is not gay.\n\nOr maybe he is.\n\nWhich brings me to two points: Black men are still archaic when it comes to anything remotely outside the male-centered construction of masculinity, and we really need to grow up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the staunch and limited definition of black maleness as defined by most black men, there are only two categories in which men's behaviors live: straight and gay. You're either one or the other, and there is little room for debate.\n\nUndefined sexuality doesn't live in the barbershop conversation of black masculinity. So because Beckham's antics, his shirtless dancing and hot tub shenanigans can't be identified on the straight scale, he must be gay. Don't believe me? His friend and former Louisiana State University teammate Kavahra Holmes, who danced with Beckham in one of his viral online posts, had to speak about his sexuality because the internet just wouldn't chill.\n\n\"It's crazy how we been brothers for so long and if anybody really knows us know anywhere we go they see us being clowns and dancing but of course it's made as 'we gay,\u2019\u201d Holmes wrote on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Strictly brotherhood and just cuz we dancing having fun don't make us gay.. I dance with our [sic] without him and vice versa so the 'gay' comments really funny .. We laughing \u2026 But we gone keep dancing lol,\" he continued.\n\nKeep dancing, indeed.\n\nClearly, Odell Beckham Jr. and friends are not concerned about how their sexuality is perceived, and, in fact, I'm convinced that ODB is trolling us. He knows that his sexuality is a topic of discussion, and he keeps doing things that have us talking. His carefree expression of black maleness is a beautiful exploration of boundary-pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I find it hilarious that one of the top five players in one of the most brutal sports doesn't care what you think about who he is. He's Dennis Rodman minus the drugs and other off-the-court slipups. He's Omar Little from The Wire minus the boyfriend, trench coat and sawed-off shotgun. He doesn't care what you think of him and his carefreeness. He's expanding the idea of masculinity and brushing up against all who believe football players should be beer-can-crushing barbarians. And, clearly, he likes it this way. At this point, I really think that Odell Beckham Jr. sits at home thinking about how he can grow the idea of masculinity when not dominating the league's best corners.\n\nLet's not forget: Odell Beckham Jr. is a product of a fitted generation\u2014a generation whose jeans are slim and shirts are small; their dances are loose and their hair is dyed; and they aren't as obsessed about sexuality as generations before them. This generation not only has given us Frank Ocean, Lil B, Jaden Smith and Young Thug but also has fully embraced their non-gender conformity. They have embraced their uniqueness, and the generation before them\u2014the ones whose parents screamed on them for wearing their clothes so big and baggy\u2014can't stop judging the uniqueness of the generation after them.\n\nWho cares if Odell Beckham Jr. likes dancing with his shirtless friends? Or if he and his teammates kick it in the hot tub (no time machine)? Not me. Times are changing; masculinity is begging to have the definition expanded a bit to include individual expression. And this isn't the first time. NBA players did it in the \u201970s with their flamboyant dress. Hell, Russell Westbrook and Cam Newton continue to push the boundaries of men's fashion. Former NFL player and college standout Michael Sam did it after he came out as a proud gay man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can't continue holding black men to the simplest, most barbaric, most archaic form of what being a man entails. If so, we will always be limited. We will always be expressionless, grunting sloths, and aren't we more than that? Odell Beckham Jr. does whatever he wants, and that includes dogging your favorite team's defense. Maybe the focus really needs to be on how to stop the fun he's having on the field (looking at you, my beloved Washington Redskin and Beckham nemesis Josh Norman), rather than worrying about the fun he's having off of it.\n\nStephen A.

Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah.

When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood.

I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago.

A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866.

I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about?

My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously.

He defended Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and claimed that a lack of compromise caused the war.\n\n\u201cI would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man,\u201d Kelly told host Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cAnd men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew widespread criticism from historians, pundits, and congressional and religious leaders. Among them was Hilary Shelton, head of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the NAACP, who called Kelly\u2019s historical revision \u201cdangerously simplistic,\u201d according to McClatchy DC Bureau.

Off-White designer Virgil Abloh knows how to draw a crowd, but his Fall/Winter 2018 runway presentation almost closed down before it opened.\n\n\n\nAn uninvited and impromptu throng of sneakerheads gathered outside the venue in hopes of scoring a pair of Off-White x Nike, which Footwear News reported will be the first time Nike has made Jordans in women\u2019s sizes. The press line turned into a mosh pit, toppling the velvet ropes as celebs and members of the fashion press reportedly tussled with fans seeking to push their way into the show.\n\nMy friend and Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post writer Robin Givhan was accidentally clocked in the head by an overzealous fan en route to her front-row seat. Once the press finally settled inside, fans were left standing outside or scattered elsewhere, no doubt on a search for the shoes, slated to go on sale March 3.\n\nPhoto: Vittorio Zunio (Celotto/Getty Images)\n\nHow did Abloh whip up this latest footwear fan-frenzy? With nylon mesh sneakers distinguished by a red zip tie\u2014yes, that kind of thick, tough plastic doohickey used in consumer packaged goods to hold electrical cords and sometimes as police restraints. No matter the value, it\u2019s the meaning\u2014or, rather, the thought\u2014that counts in fashion, especially in Abloh\u2019s world.

There were capes, cropped bustiers, sculpted shorts and corsets reminiscent of King Louis XIV\u2019s courtiers worn over white button-down shirts and accented with electric-blue Musketeer-inspired boots, all tailor-made for editorial shoots.\n\nTaken apart piece by piece, the corsets would work to wake up any outfit, while the boots are likely only for the brave and directional in terms of footwear\u2014likely not without a yacht in the South of France and the budget to match.\n\nPhoto: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Fashion designer Virgil Abloh walks the runway during the Off-White show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2018/2019 on March 1, 2018, in Paris.

About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah.

A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood.

I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah.

I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: the couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said \u2018yes,\u2019 because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th birthday party for his new fianc\u00e9e, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward...[I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond and pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown and black girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters, and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation, his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown, with a deep-v neckline and blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, The bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit.

The suit was filed in New York County Supreme Court in Manhattan.\n\nAs the New York Daily News reports, Pirro\u2019s commentary stems from her coverage of a separate lawsuit filed against Mckesson and Black Lives Matter by an anonymous Baton Rouge police officer. Mckesson and BLM were in Baton Rouge to protest the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling. The cop claimed that he was hit in the face with a rock by one of the protesters\u2014an assault, he said, that was directed by Mckesson.\n\nBut on Sept. 28, a federal judge threw out the suit because the officer couldn\u2019t provide any evidence that Mckesson incited the violence. The Louisiana judge also ruled that Black Lives Matter, as a social movement, could not be sued.\n\n\n\nThe lack of evidence didn\u2019t seem to matter to Pirro, a former Westchester County, N.Y., district attorney. She stuck to the anonymous officer\u2019s side of the story, naming McKesson as the organizer of the protest and telling Fox & Friends viewers that he was \u201cactually directing people, was directing the violence.\u201d\n\nBear in mind\u2014this was after the judge had ruled that there was no proof Mckesson did any of these things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a police officer who was injured; he was injured at the direction of DeRay Mckesson,\u201d Pirro said on the \u201cnews\u201d program. \u201cDeRay Mckesson walks away with $100,000, for an organization that is amorphous. We got a problem in this country.\u201d\n\nFox & Friends is the most watched cable propaganda news show in its time slot and, according to AdWeek, is having its most watched year in program history.\n\nMckesson called this out in the suit.\n\n\u201cPirro made these false statements of fact on the highest-viewed morning cable show in the country, Fox & Friends, which reaches over 1.7 million viewers,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says that Pirro\u2019s widely viewed comments have endangered his safety. Although Pirro claimed via Twitter that her statements were based on the Baton Rouge cop\u2019s lawsuit, Mckesson pointed out that she had described them as though they were facts, not as though they were merely the officer\u2019s side of the story.\n\n\u201cThese statements of fact are false,\u201d reads Mckesson\u2019s suit, \u201cand were either known to be false by Defendant Pirro or were made with reckless disregard for whether they were true.\u201d\n\nLibel and defamation cases against media outlets are notoriously difficult to win because malicious intent needs to be proved (while getting facts wrong because of negligence can ruin an outlet\u2019s reputation, the First Amendment protects the media\u2019s right to get it wrong from time to time).

Neon-bright splashes of color were worked into black ruched bodices on black cocktail dresses, threading strands of color like embedded computer cables; creating a kind of body map that was a fun trip for the eye.

Off-White designer Virgil Abloh knows how to draw a crowd, but his Fall/Winter 2018 runway presentation almost closed down before it opened.\n\n\n\nAn uninvited and impromptu throng of sneakerheads gathered outside the venue in hopes of scoring a pair of Off-White x Nike, which Footwear News reported will be the first time Nike has made Jordans in women\u2019s sizes. The press line turned into a mosh pit, toppling the velvet ropes as celebs and members of the fashion press reportedly tussled with fans seeking to push their way into the show.\n\nMy friend and Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post writer Robin Givhan was accidentally clocked in the head by an overzealous fan en route to her front-row seat. Once the press finally settled inside, fans were left standing outside or scattered elsewhere, no doubt on a search for the shoes, slated to go on sale March 3.\n\nPhoto: Vittorio Zunio (Celotto/Getty Images)\n\nHow did Abloh whip up this latest footwear fan-frenzy? With nylon mesh sneakers distinguished by a red zip tie\u2014yes, that kind of thick, tough plastic doohickey used in consumer packaged goods to hold electrical cords and sometimes as police restraints. No matter the value, it\u2019s the meaning\u2014or, rather, the thought\u2014that counts in fashion, especially in Abloh\u2019s world. Believers will pay upward of $1,600 for sneakers just to have a piece of his mind on their closet shelves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbloh also gets the best of the best when it comes to models: Gigi and Bella Hadid, Joan Smalls, Dilone, Liya Kebede, Alek Wek and some gorgeous new faces lit up the runway in a collection that seemed to be part equestrian and part late-\u201980s nightlife. There were capes, cropped bustiers, sculpted shorts and corsets reminiscent of King Louis XIV\u2019s courtiers worn over white button-down shirts and accented with electric-blue Musketeer-inspired boots, all tailor-made for editorial shoots.\n\nTaken apart piece by piece, the corsets would work to wake up any outfit, while the boots are likely only for the brave and directional in terms of footwear\u2014likely not without a yacht in the South of France and the budget to match.\n\nPhoto: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Photo: Francois Durand (Getty Images) Fashion designer Virgil Abloh walks the runway during the Off-White show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2018/2019 on March 1, 2018, in Paris.

He sent them down the runway with opera-length black gloves and black Off-White x Nike sneakers. It\u2019s the perfect uniform for young girls on the club-crawl circuit, paired with small sunglasses in cat-eye shapes, stiff scarves tied like ribbons at the back of the neck and structured top-handled bags.\n\nThe bags\u2014with the word \u201cSculpture,\u201d the date and Abloh\u2019s name printed in block letters\u2014will no doubt go viral on the knockoff market, soon to become a global fast-fashion hit on the worldwide dance floor.

Preston\u2019s first foray into fashion under his HPC Trading Company label was a series of repurposed New York City sanitation worker uniforms. Similarly, Abloh craftily uses high art and street-level shoes sold at penthouse prices to ground himself in fashion. Their collaboration features PVC bags with leather handles bolted on with lug nuts and shoulder straps suspended by industrial D rings. They fetch some $942 for a mini bag and $1,232 for the tote.\n\nPreston\u2019s official press release describes Abloh\u2014the advisor to Kanye West\u2019s Life of Pablo project and Nike\u2019s digital consultant\u2014as \u201cthe true embodiment of an artist born of the post-internet generation.

Robert E. Lee as \u201can honorable man who gave up his country to fight for his state\u201d\u2014a claim that is categorically untrue.\n\n\u201cMen and women of good faith on both sides made their stand,\u201d Kelly continued during his interview with Ingraham, evoking his boss\u2019s controversial comments about this summer\u2019s deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. At that time, Donald Trump displayed his sympathy toward neo-Nazis and white nationalists by lauding the \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides of the protests. (In retrospect, it\u2019s possible Kelly fed him that line.)\n\nBut the most appalling and dangerous argument Kelly offered Monday night was that a \u201clack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs many finer minds than mine have noted, Kelly\u2019s comments were at once ludicrous, irresponsible, deeply ahistorical and soaked in the vinegar of white supremacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more notable responses came from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who delivered a blistering critique on Kelly\u2019s comments in a Twitter thread posted early Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLee wasn\u2019t some agnostic pressed into war. He was a dude who thought torture was cool,\u201d Coates also tweeted, and added an account from one of Lee\u2019s former slaves, written in a recent Atlantic article, about how the honorable general would have saltwater thrown on his slaves\u2019 backs after they were whipped\u2014\u201cnot satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s Civil War comments were shocking to some because the general was always presumed to be the \u201cadult in the room\u201d amid the Trump administration.\n\nHe lost that distinction, widely, when he attacked Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) in the wake of Trump\u2019s controversial call to a Gold Star widow. Calling Wilson an \u201cempty barrel,\u201d Kelly illustrated his disgust with the black lawmaker from Florida with a story about a speech she made that was completely untrue.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen confronted with video evidence of his lie, Kelly didn\u2019t apologize. The episode revealed a lot about the general\u2019s character\u2014about what may have drawn him to Trump in the first place\u2014and busted the myth that he may be some sort of moderating influence on the president.\n\nThere is absolute nothing moderate about \u201ccompromising\u201d on human bondage.\n\nDid Kelly think, as many good white men of his ilk do, that he was being reasonable? That compromise is, in and of itself, a virtue? Or did Kelly, in some way, hope to shift the conversation away from what was by many accounts a long and arduous day at the White House?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that as ridiculous and bigoted as Kelly\u2019s comments were, they speak directly to the hearts of Trump\u2019s fervent base. Invoking the honor and virtues of the Confederacy is the sort of cattle call that drove white people to Tennessee to proclaim \u201cWhite lives matter\u201d this weekend.\n\nOr, is it what so many people of color know in this country to be true\u2014that the good white men so often entrusted with protecting and guiding America know the least about it? That they don\u2019t, in fact, care about the country enough to move past their own idealized role in it?\n\n\n\nLee fought against the United States. We don\u2019t teach the Civil War this way because, as with most aspects of our history, Americans are reluctant to face it head-on. The \u201cUnion Army\u201d is a euphemism\u2014it was the U.S. military against which the Confederacy, a separate country, with its own president and its own money and its expressed commitment to keeping and expanding slavery, took arms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is who and what Kelly was defending.\n\nKelly\u2019s Civil War comments leave no doubt about who Kelly is. But the real horror, made clear time and time again this year, is that Kelly is certainly not alone, and that good white men and women like him aren\u2019t afraid to follow his lead.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "compromise", "comments", "war", "country", "john", "trump", "kelly", "night", "led", "good", "trumps", "civil", "lack"], "polarity": 0.10312722103766882, "subjectivity": 0.4952025586353945},

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business. In her words: \u201cIt\u2019s instantly transformative to have a beautiful piece of fabric on your head.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster makeup artist Porsche Cooper\u2014a favorite of elite photographers; brands like Tiffany and Est\u00e9e Lauder; and stars like supermodel Joan Smalls and singer Andra Day\u2014told The Glow Up:\n\nDiversity and equal representation in the beauty and fashion industries is a hard-fought and necessary cause, so to be a part of pushing the cause and conversation along is a great honor. To have my iconic muse Iman, and new muse Imaan Hammam, on the anniversary Vogue Arabia cover at once is my wildest fantasy come true. Two melanin queens clad in couture on a total of three covers that will wrap the globe ... I could not be more thrilled.\n\nThe Glow Up couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n", "keywords": ["iman", "arabias", "vogue", "black", "anniversary", "stella", "wrap", "model", "wraps", "issue", "cover", "head", "look", "imaan"], "polarity": 0.19964268535697108, "subjectivity": 0.5408283515426373},

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah.

Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

A federal judge ruled Thursday that Black Lives Matter is a social movement not unlike the civil rights movement or the Tea Party, and therefore cannot be sued.\n\nThe police officer filed his lawsuit against BLM and Mckesson last year, after he was reportedly injured during a protest in Baton Rouge after the shooting of Alton Sterling. The Associated Press reports that U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson dismissed the officer\u2019s lawsuit, ruling that Black Lives Matter is an entity incapable of being sued.\n\nIn his 24-page ruling, Jackson said that the officer\u2019s own claims demonstrated that Mckesson \u201csolely engaged in protected speech\u201d at the July 9, 2016, demonstration.\n\nJackson wrote in his ruling, \u201cAlthough many entities have utilized the phrase \u2018black lives matter\u2019 in their titles or business designations, \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 itself is not an entity of any sort.\u201d\n\nThe officer\u2019s suit also attempted to add the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter\u2014described as \u201ca national unincorporated association\u201d based in California\u2014as a defendant, but Jackson ruled that a hashtag cannot be sued, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor reasons that should be obvious, a hashtag\u2014which is an expression that categorizes or classifies a person\u2019s thought\u2014is not a \u2018juridical person\u2019 and therefore lacks the capacity to be sued,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nDonna Grodner, the attorney representing the officer in the lawsuit, also has a separate lawsuit filed against Black Lives Matter and Mckesson on behalf of a sheriff\u2019s deputy who was wounded by the gunman who shot and killed three other law-enforcement officers in Baton Rouge last summer. That case, which is pending before Judge Jackson, alleges that BLM and five of its leaders incited violence that led to the deadly ambush.\n\nWhile making an earlier argument that Black Lives Matter should be held accountable, Grodner said, \u201cIt\u2019s organized. They have meetings. They solicit money. They have national chapters. This shows a level of national organization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter hearing about the ruling, Mckesson said Thursday: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that I did nothing wrong that day and that the police were the only violent people in the streets. The movement began as a call to end violence and that call remains the same today.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Associated Press.", "keywords": ["mckesson", "jackson", "judge", "ruling", "black", "rouge", "lawsuit", "officers", "lives", "matter", "deray", "sued", "rules", "dismisses", "movement"], "polarity": -0.04409722222222221, "subjectivity": 0.44236111111111115},

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business. In her words: \u201cIt\u2019s instantly transformative to have a beautiful piece of fabric on your head.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster makeup artist Porsche Cooper\u2014a favorite of elite photographers; brands like Tiffany and Est\u00e9e Lauder; and stars like supermodel Joan Smalls and singer Andra Day\u2014told The Glow Up:\n\nDiversity and equal representation in the beauty and fashion industries is a hard-fought and necessary cause, so to be a part of pushing the cause and conversation along is a great honor. To have my iconic muse Iman, and new muse Imaan Hammam, on the anniversary Vogue Arabia cover at once is my wildest fantasy come true. Two melanin queens clad in couture on a total of three covers that will wrap the globe ... I could not be more thrilled.\n\nThe Glow Up couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n", "keywords": ["iman", "arabias", "vogue", "black", "anniversary", "stella", "wrap", "model", "wraps", "issue", "cover", "head", "look", "imaan"], "polarity": 0.19964268535697108, "subjectivity": 0.5408283515426373},

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting. They were just plain racist.

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That.

Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: the couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said \u2018yes,\u2019 because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th birthday party for his new fianc\u00e9e, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward...[I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond and pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown and black girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters, and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation, his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown, with a deep-v neckline and blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, The bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit. The color also played well off of the rose gold of Iman\u2019s engagement and wedding rings, which is her favorite metal and the only one she wears\u2014even the chairs in the reception ballroom were rose gold!\n\nWith friends Chrissy Teigen, Tiffany Haddish and Gabrielle Union in attendance\u2014and yes, that\u2019s Odell Beckham in the wedding party; Iman and Shepard met at one of his parties\u2014this truly looked like the wedding of the year.

One simply cannot tell the history of black Confederates\u2014most of whom were enslaved and forced to labor or to perform menial duties for their masters on the battlefield\u2014without talking about the coercion. \u201cConfederates impressed slaves as laborers and at times forced them to fight.

I yelled it out early this morning when my mother woke me up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF!\u201d is exactly how I said it when she came busting into my room demanding that I get my clothes on to go to meet Jesus.\n\nTwo days ago she found me passed out, bleeding, in my closet, and ever since then she is convinced that I\u2019m trying to kill myself. She thinks that she\u2019s going to walk in and find me hanging from the ceiling, my neck stuffed into one of her good bedsheets, so she has taken me to the man she believes can bring me away from the darkness, off the devil music and back to the boy I never was, but the one she wants me to be.\n\n\u201cArthur, either you are outside in the next 10 minutes or I\u2019m sending you to stay with your father.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father is a zombie who lives in a small apartment in S.E. that isn\u2019t close to anything but drugs and a gas station that sells everything he needs to do drugs. I went to see him when he first got the apartment, right after the divorce, and I stayed up all night looking out the bedroom window onto MLK Ave. That night I watched a woman give a man a blow job behind a school and saw two kids, no older than me, beat an African taxicab driver to his knees for no reason. Once my mother realized that my dad, who had lost his job, only had his apartment because he let the drug dealers sell their drugs out of it\u2014which meant that they paid his rent and he got free drugs\u2014she stopped sending me there. From then on he became a drugged-out Aesop\u2019s fable, a stoned John Henry (if the hammer was a crack pipe) or all starving African children.\n\nDidn\u2019t do your homework! Your father didn\u2019t do his homework and look at him. Rules are there for a reason. Look how your father ended up living without rules. Didn\u2019t clean the dishes! You can go live with your father where that nigga doesn\u2019t even have plates!\n\nNormally I treat her stories like stories, just words without meaning unless I put them there, but this morning, something in her voice tells me she is tired. Maybe it\u2019s the absence of yelling that usually accompanies her threats, or maybe it\u2019s that she said my full name, which always carried trouble and consequence. Either way we both know that whether I was or wasn\u2019t trying to kill myself, sending me to live with the person who isn\u2019t living means that I stop living, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI walk to the car, groggy-eyed, open the door soft, fall into the chilly leather seat and slam the door hard. My mother slaps the back of my head, but I already felt it coming, so it didn\u2019t sting. She makes a left onto North Capitol, a right on Bryant, crosses First, and parks.\n\n\u201cWe could have walked here,\u201d I say.\n\nMy mother scrunches her face, and I notice that she is in full war paint: Eyes, lips and cheeks are all colored. Her light-brown hair is curled tight to her head. I also know that the reason we didn\u2019t walk the three-and-a-half blocks is that I embarrass my mother. My hair is pink. My girlfriend\u2014well, ex-girlfriend\u2014Dolphin dyed it pink right before we broke up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a foot taller than my mother and thin as a whisper. My T-shirt barely comes to my waist; my jeans look painted on, they\u2019re so tight, but I haven\u2019t broken them in yet, which is the only reason I wore them outside; they taper down to my platform black-and-white check Tuks. They\u2019re hard to find, but I got them at an old thrift shop in upper NW. I\u2019d like to think they were Ian MacKaye\u2019s old shoes, ones that he wrecked and ravaged playing night after night in some seedy basement that I was now lucky enough to wear. Of course the soles are coming apart and the once nubby black suede has turned into a washed-out gray, the laces look chewed, and these say that I have been somewhere and seen more than my age.\n\nMy belt is leather, thick, and has stick figure fish skeletons across it in white. My skin is my mother\u2019s\u2014brown like cooked chicken just set on the napkin to rest\u2014but my eyes are wild and my thick, nappy hair says that I am Zombie\u2019s son. I look down at my wrinkled white shirt and feel the shame that being me brings. I get out and shut the door softly.\n\nThe man who is to save me is short, broad and wearing a navy blue suit with thick pinstripes that look like they were drawn with chalk. The shoulders of said suit stick out wider than his shoulders and make his jacket look draped on and too big for his body. His skin and shoes are shiny brown, and his black-and-gray hair is cut tight to his head like a cigarette-ash skullcap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHey, Jesus,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cOh, I am not Jesus, son,\u201d he says. He smiles at my mother and turns back to me. \u201cI\u2019m not a pastor, either. I\u2019m a man of God, though, and your mother\u2019s worried. Consider me like a brother. Lot of folks \u2019round here call me Brother Krall.\u201d\n\nHe holds out his hand for me to shake it and smiles harder this time so my mother can see his teeth. For the most part, the tops of his choppers are whitelike, but his bottoms are dirty snow. He has one top tooth on the right side way near the back of his mouth that is framed in gold. Not a gold tooth\u2014he literally has a thin string of gold lining one of his back teeth. I smack the palm of his hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNice tooth, Jesus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNice church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start. I consider it a spirit house.\u201d\n\nWhere was God when Porch beat the piss out of me until I yelled that I was a faggot? Where was God when Blue took a piss on Mongoose with the mag spokes? Until we clear this up, God and I aren\u2019t really on speaking terms, but I see now why my mother has brought me to this place, and it isn\u2019t so much for my salvation as it is to feed her loneliness. My mother likes Jesus, and I\u2019m her excuse and her explanation. I don\u2019t even have to say anything, as my looks are enough to explain why she needs saving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer Barney-purple knit sweater is too tight and cut too low for the room, which is nothing but old people in the basement of K.C. Lewis Elementary. There are chairs that don\u2019t match. Some are blue, some are red and some look like urine. Jesus is talking to my mom, who keeps laughing and leaning forward, and every time she does, a little more of her hidden skin, skin that is only meant for the bathroom mirror, shows, and Jesus just keeps smiling and there is that tooth, that one way in the back that\u2019s lined in gold that is telling me that his first joke is to get her to laugh and then bend a bit, while the real trick is to peek down the front of her sweater. And my mother, the woman who less than an hour ago was calling me all kinds of ungodly names, keeps touching Jesus\u2019 hand and bending forward, and at this point, her V-neck sweater might as well be a U-neck.\n\nThese two old people flirting makes me want to rinse my eyeballs in bleach, so I stop watching my mother and Jesus and look around the room and see a laminated children\u2019s food pyramid with a cartoon white girl standing holding a half-eaten apple. Old food and juice stain the cement walls that aren\u2019t covered with tiles. There can\u2019t be more than 15 people here, who stand in the back eating doughnuts off a tilted conference table whose tablecloth is about as tight as my mother\u2019s sweater.\n\n\u201cMa, you want a doughnut?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt, don\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus knows about patience. Don\u2019t you, Jesus?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says.\n\nI ignore Jesus and walk over to the table and see that all the old people have totally killed the doughnuts. The face of the skinny guy crowding the doughnuts is plain, brown. His skin is smooth and he smells like wet wood. His tan leather jacket was probably cooler when Malcolm X was alive, since the collar is fat like butterfly wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo more glazed, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kidding? That\u2019s all I come here for.\u201d\n\nHe knows that I know there aren\u2019t any more glaze because I can see he\u2019s holding three stacked doughnuts in a golden glaze tower on a napkin that is wet with sugar. He is eating one, which means, by my count, he has had at least four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI look at his stack and then up at him, and he shoves the last bit of brown honey goodness into his mouth and starts on his next one. He looks back at me, scrunches his face, and I know that trying to get a doughnut from this old man would be like trying to get my mom to get off my back.\n\nI look over to the table: six plain doughnuts. I grab one, lick it and rub the licked side in the box that once held the glazed.\n\nJesus speaks.\n\n\u201cEveryone, if you want to find a chair, we can go head and get started.\u201d\n\nMy mother waves me off the table, and before I leave, I double-dip back in the glaze and shove the rest in my mouth. I can barely taste anything but thick cake dough. My mother is up front at attention, with her back straight and her chest out, and I wish I didn\u2019t have to be here to see this, her and Jesus all coy and stupid. The old people move like fat cows looking for new grass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sit way in the back and stretch my legs out straight when my mother looks at me and coughs once, strong, which is to tell me to \u201cget up here.\u201d I act like I don\u2019t understand. I point to my throat. Then I mime drinking a cup of water and lay my palm flat as if it is holding a tray, and then mime the drinking-water part again. She curls her top lip and snarls \u201cGet up here\u201d in a language that is an inch above a bark.\n\nJesus is waiting for me. He literally has his hands clasped tight in front of him like a prayer, and I can see he has a pinkie ring with a red stone in it. When I stand, I see that there isn\u2019t a seat for me near my mother, so I snatch a urine-colored seat on my way up and drag the legs against the cold fake-marble floor, and the noise, the steady claw of the metal legs against the ground, is upsetting everyone.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pick that chair up,\u201d my mother says, and I do.\n\nWhen I get to the front, my mother grabs my arm and squeezes, and I can feel her nails digging into my skin. I don\u2019t even care at this point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Krall,\u201d she says to Jesus.\n\nHe moves the pinkie-ring hand towards my mother like he\u2019s shooing her apology away.\n\nThen Jesus speaks again.\n\n\u201cFor those of y\u2019all that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m Brother Krall and I\u2019d like to welcome y\u2019all to the Bryant Street Spirit House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOr a fucking lunchroom,\u201d I mumble. My mother squeezes my arm again.\n\n\u201cCome on up here, Diane, as this works better with a partner.\u201d\n\nMy mother lets my arm go. I look down and see that her nails have left little marks in my skin. I rub where her nails once were and I can feel the divots. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but I rub it like it does. My mother ignores me as she stands up smiling like that fat white guy just called her out of the audience to play The Price Is Right. I want to vomit. She turns and puts her purse in her seat and pushes the sleeves up on her titty sweater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is ready for Jesus.\n\n\u201cNow, you stand right there,\u201d he says to her, and places her so that she has her back to him. She stands there giggling and peeking over her shoulder and looking back at the old folks as if she is really worried.\n\nThen Jesus says: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t make cars or know how to fix them, but let\u2019s say that Diane is a car. What kind of car are you, Diane?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fast car,\u201d my mother answers and then laughs and puts her face in her hands like she is embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, all cool and stupid. \u201cA fast car works.\u201d\n\nShe is flirting with Jesus, and I can feel little bits of dry dough in the middle of my throat starting to work themselves back up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, today, Diane, your fast car is stuck. The way the Spirit House works is, I\u2019m like a tow truck for God, and if you\u2019re stuck \u2026 \u201d\n\nHe walks towards my mother\u2019s backside, and he puts his hands around my mother\u2019s waist. \u201cI can pull you out,\u201d he says, and drags the word \u201cpull\u201d long and slow like an endless chain while he slowly brings my mother into him. My mother makes this \u201cWhy I never,\u201d old-antebellum-mint-julep face while Jesus stands there with my mother\u2019s butt pressed up against his dick. My mother leans her head back.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get unstuck?!\u201d he yells out from his stomach.\n\nAnd the old people all hopped up on glazed sugar start screaming back.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\n\n\u201cMove me, Lord!\u201d\n\nJesus smiles hard, and I can see that one tooth that is way in the back that is lined in gold, and the old people all hopped up on glazed doughnuts start laughing and yelling, and that thinly lined gold tooth almost winks at me. It almost says I don\u2019t know God; it almost says I\u2019m going to be in your house at ungodly hours in a wifebeater, boxers and dress socks; it almost says Go head and kill yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s embarrassing who now?\u201d I say when my mother gets back to her seat.\n\n\u201cA boy with pink hair can\u2019t tell me nothing about embarrassing anyone,\u201d she says.\n\nI wish I had worn the T-shirt I wanted to wear. It said, \u201cFishbone: Still Stuck in Your Throat,\u201d which highlighted the group\u2019s seminal classic \u201cLet Dem Hoes Fight,\u201d but my mother told me to take it off. So I switched it to a plain white Hanes undershirt in protest of my mother\u2019s ignorance about the best black punk band ever. I tried to explain to my mother that her insistence on sending me out of Stronghold and way off to St. Albans private school is what made me like this. I was never going to like the boys in Stronghold, loud and gangsta, and once I got to St. Albans, I knew I would never wear polo shirts and Sperrys. I was rebellious and confusing, a black kid who found refuge in punks. In hard core, in double bass drums, in power chords; in loud, sweaty concerts where blood and bruises were a badge of honor; in the glory of piercings and tattoos\u2014a visible fuck-you to anyone who didn\u2019t understand; in everything everyone else found disgust in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it was the dual shame I was attracted to, to be black and punk\u2014to be hated and denigrated in either world, to know that those who did understand were the only people for me. I tried to explain to her that punk culture was close to the radical \u201960s and all the shit that she glorified, wearing Afros and Panther buttons. What she wanted was an educated, conscious son who didn\u2019t end his sentences with prepositions; what she got was something way left for her, and at this point I think she would just rather me be gay. At least we could gossip.\n\n\n\nMy breakup with Dolphin led me here, to this lunchroom on this day with my mother, and I am wondering how any of this is supposed to make me better. I had already gone through the three phases of black crisis intervention: The first proved fruitless, since I am almost a foot taller than my mother and have her by at least 80 pounds, so when she threatened to beat the shit out of me, it did nothing.\n\nThe second phase didn\u2019t do anything, since I stopped caring what the family thought of me around the time I got my first pair of Docs and started listening to German punk. To her, shame was still an effective way of crisis management. So when she called everyone and told them that I was losing my grip since the breakup, I was already laying in the bed blasting Fishbone into my headphones and reading Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition out loud. And even with all the noise going, I could still hear my mother\u2014who was walking back and forth in front of my room\u2014saying to a person I believed was my Aunt Beatrice, \u201cThat boy is into that white stuff, and now he\u2019s all cut up over some white girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI kept yelling:\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nPart of her story was true: My breakup with Dolphin was tragic. It came after we\u2019d gone down to the Library of Congress to see a Baldwin retrospective, and I casually mentioned how I thought that being gay and dealing with his sexuality first allowed someone like Baldwin to really free himself into his work. She claimed that somehow I was being insensitive to the plight of the gays. I told her that wasn\u2019t the case. More was said. Mostly her talk-shouting about how could I be such an insensitive asshole. I didn\u2019t get it. She told me we were over. I really didn\u2019t get it. Days later, after hours of research on homosexuality and the Harlem Renaissance to help make my point, she stopped me before I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cArtie. This is so constricted. The whole fallacy of hetero relations and the conformity of the male-female domination is just \u2026 I don\u2019t know ... lame. Like your paying for the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any fucking money!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m saying, Artie; your temper, the structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomasine. You. can\u2019t. do. this. To. Me. To. Us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Dolphin.\u201d\n\nD-i-a-l-t-o-n-e.\n\nI threw the phone into the kitchen wall and it shattered into pieces.\n\nI got into my dark Levi\u2019s and my Fishbone Give a Monkey a Brain and He\u2019ll Swear He\u2019s the Center of the Universe T-shirt because I felt like if I was going to be the part, I might as well dress the part. I opened a bottle of Jack that I had under my bed and played Fishbone\u2019s \u201cServitude\u201d on repeat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got drunk faster than I thought I would, and by the fifth time the song came around, Angelo Moore kept yelling at me in his South Central falsetto:\n\nGod\u2019s not with you \u2026 holy roller \u2026 your heart dwells in hell.\n\nI raged. I launched myself into the walls of my room like I was in a mosh pit. I cut my shoulder on the door and the blood soaked through my shirt slow. I don\u2019t remember the cuts on my face or hands, as I was numb. I remember bleeding. I remember bending over to catch my breath, and then I remember the room shifting sideways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI threw myself around my room and shattered into pieces. My mother found me unconscious in the room with blood all over the carpet.\n\nThis is where the legend of my killing myself began.\n\nShe told me she was going to beat the shit out of me if I couldn\u2019t pull it together.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet some white girl run you down like that.\u201d\n\nMy mother was embarrassed when I started dating Dolphin. She thought it was a physical manifestation of my hate for her. None of that was true, but that\u2019s the way she would phrase it to her sisters, or the hen house, as Zombie called them when they got to squawking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Mom; I just love Dolphin.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dolphin.\u2019 You hear that, Bea? The bitch named after a fish.\u201d\n\nShe was naming herself after a freedom that she thought only came to animals left in the wild. She was trying to reclaim a part of her that felt confined by societal standards. She didn\u2019t like her birth name or even the idea of birth names, as she believed that naming someone was akin to ownership, and I explained all of this to my mom and told her that Thomasine calling herself Dolphin was no different then when blacks started changing to Muslim names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPlease stop comparing that little white girl to what we went through \u2026 \u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help the day my mother pulled up in her tiny gray Nissan Sentra and I was on the porch with Dolphin, who\u2019d just started letting her hair dread. We had already had sex in the house, but we knew to move it to the porch, as my mother didn\u2019t like it when we were home without her supervision, which meant me and Dolphin sitting in the living room while my mother watched TV in the kitchen. So by moving to the porch, we let her believe that we were sexless. My mother, who had just gotten off work, was saying something about getting something out of the back seat of the car when she saw Dolphin\u2019s thick blond dread in the front of her face.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked Dolphin.\n\nAnd Dolphin didn\u2019t get it. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was burning a hole through the top of her thick, dirty-blond hair. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was working over all of the black things stolen by whites. She didn\u2019t see that my mother was seething with a kind of hatred that only comes from realizing that you have been betrayed, because to Dolphin, she hadn\u2019t done anything to my mother. She hadn\u2019t stolen anything, beaten anything, taken anything from her. She sat there looking for something on her Chocolate Genius GodMusic T-shirt that said I was just in your house, in your son\u2019s room, in positions that only gymnast or acrobats should perform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need me to get something out of the car?\u201d I said, shuffling down the walkway towards Adams.\n\nMy mother, carrying her empty green mesh lunch bag from work in one hand and an elbow full of ungraded school papers, just looked down on Dolphin the way a slave owner looked down a slave deciding whether or not he should sell him. I could feel Dolphin looking out at me for safety, some kind of line that would bring her back to shore. But I had nothing for her, no net, no rope and no words to throw overboard.\n\nI looked at my mother in her blue school dress and red belt that came across her waist like the equator and then at Dolphin, so thin and pale in dusty cutoff Dickies and dirty red Chucks with no laces. The two women who would be the closest to my core, both oceans away. I looked down at the top of my red Dr. Martens that weren\u2019t scuffed enough to look believable, my boots that showed no signs of revolution, still carried the out-of-box shininess that showed my face to look just like what I was: sheltered. It was then that I realized that the truth didn\u2019t really live with Dolphin and me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back on it, this was probably the first root that broke through the pavement because no matter how much I loved pulling and kissing and tugging Dolphin\u2019s flesh, I just couldn\u2019t cross my mother. So Dolphin broke first. She looked away from me and down at her hands and then at her feet and then into the ground and off into a distance where my mother hadn\u2019t come home. And my mother let her off the hook and took her papers, her lunch bag and the last remnants of her Afro, the tiny hairs that she couldn\u2019t curl that rested on the bottom part of her neck, way lower than the de-revolutionized permed and pressed-out part that covered it, and pulled the screen door and walked into the kitchen. I stuck my hands in the front of my jeans and frowned my face the way that only wordlessness can leave jaws tight, and walked back from the car and sat next to Dolphin, who started crying.\n\n\u201cWhy does your mother hate me?\u201d\n\n\u2026 sujeta en mis brazos como un pez infinitamente pegado a mi alma r\u00e1pido y lento en la energia subceleste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is what I should\u2019ve said. I should have pulled on the only quote that I memorized from the Spanish version of Neruda poems that she gave me and that I struggled through that night with her on the phone and she giggled and said \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time.\n\nBut what I said in that moment when she needed me most, in that moment when my mother just walked in and crushed us back to babies, in that moment when I realized just how small we both were\u2014in that moment, all I could muster was, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t hate you; she just loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallelujah!\u201d A fat black woman yells who is too big to praise dance, so she just wiggles and holds her hand above her head, waving Jesus away.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is in full bloom, Jesus. He has a blue washcloth in his hand like dead roses, and every now and again he pats his forehead with it. He lost the jacket about six amens in, and his white shirt is now loose and wrinkled around his waist. When the sun comes in through the square-cut window in the lunchroom door and hits that back tooth that I feel like only I can see, it make his face shine. The slight glow off the thin lining that rounds that tooth like old piecrust is whispering in a language that only I can hear. I feel like it\u2019s asking, \u201cWhy do pastors and pimps dress alike?\u201d I feel like I hear, \u201cI can help you get closer to God.\u201d I turn to my mother to see if she is there with me when I hear, \u201cThese people aren\u2019t your friends.\u201d\n\nMy mother grabs my hand and holds it up to the air, and I snatch it down and ask her what she is doing. I never like when my mother forces my body to do stuff, as I have never been a fan of being pushed around.\n\n\u201cYou better put your hand back up in the air,\u201d she says.\n\nI can tell by the way the ends of her eyebrows are pointing down and inward towards her nose that I need to get it back up, so I do. Turns out, Jesus asked all the people who love God to put a hand in the air. And then he walks over to the doughnut table and snatches one of the empty doughnut baskets off the table so fast that the napkins and powder both fly from the basket and land perfectly on the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI told you we\u2019re small,\u201d he says as he hands the basket to a woman in the back of the cafeteria. \u201cJust remember when we are way out in one of those big ole churches out in Bowie and all of y\u2019all are elders, we can laugh about how we had to use the doughnut basket for the bread basket! Can I get an amen!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d\n\nThe doughnut basket makes it past me, and Mom puts in $5 for the both of us. I hear women in the back say that it was a lovely service as they gather their purses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cNext Sunday is couples counseling, so come back here with your boyfriend and girlfriends and I can show you how to get that train back on track.\u201d\n\nThe old men and women laugh, mostly at the idea that any of them have girlfriends or boyfriends, and it dawns on me that in my newfound singledom, I, too, am a part of this joke. My mother looks over at Jesus, giving him the nod, and then tells me that she will be in the car while I talk to him. He stands by the door shaking the hands of the old women leaving, who have a little bit of the gospel in their step now. When the last woman leaves, he shuts the cafeteria door and the sun stops leaking into the small window.\n\n\u201cCome on and let\u2019s talk back here,\u201d he says as he snatches his blazer and the doughnut basket off one of the seats. The room that he takes me to is right off the church, and I can tell from the red kick balls, movable balance beams, jump ropes and tennis rackets that this is gym storage. A desk sits near the back, and Jesus walks over and plops himself down in a wooden chair that doesn\u2019t flinch at his weight, and I grab a chair and put it across from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he says. \u201cPussy or money?\u201d\n\nI am thrown off by the word \u201cpussy\u201d\u2014not that I don\u2019t use it, but it feels strange coming out of Jesus\u2019 mouth, even with the tooth. I tilt my head like a dog that can\u2019t figure out if what his owner is holding is really a bone.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, man, you heard me; pussy or money?\u201d\n\nThe choice hangs between us, steaming like fresh-cooked pot roast with no knife.\n\nJesus speaks. \u201cThe way I see it, there\u2019re only two reasons a man would kill himself: pussy or not having no money. You too young to know what being broke really feels like, so it must be pussy. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s right, although I haven\u2019t been far-enough removed from Dolphin to reduce her to just a lone body part.\n\nHe leans and pulls the money basket off the table and sticks his fat fingers into the top.\n\n\u201cAlmost forgot,\u201d he says, and then reaches into his blazer pocket and pulls out two gold rings that have diamonds the size of baby teeth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBad luck to count bread without these,\u201d and he holds them up so I can see. The one he slides on his middle finger looks like a class ring, and the other he forces down his index finger looks like something a rapper wouldn\u2019t wear.\n\n\u201cNice rings,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got these off a sucker out Seat Pleasant.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if he means that he beat someone up and took their jewelry or he haggled a fool down on the price; either way I don\u2019t ask him to clear it up. Jesus licks his ringless thumb and counts each one of the dollars given him by the old folks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPussy can mess your head up,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t know what he means.\n\n\u201cTrust me when I tell you, you wouldn\u2019t be the first nigga to kill himself over a dame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe word \u201cdame\u201d feels like 1950s cop talk, and I try to straighten my face because I am sure that it says that I am lost.\n\n\u201cI knew when you walked in that you were strung out,\u201d Jesus says.\n\nI have him here.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do drugs,\u201d I say, and sit up straight, since this a common misconception that I am forced to take on as a black punk. Everyone thinks I shoot heroin because I am so thin, so I am always proud to boast that I am not Zombie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not my father.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t talking about drugs, man, although some people might call it that,\u201d and Jesus laughs hard at both his joke and my ignorance.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d I say, slouching back in my seat. Slightly defeated.\n\n\u201cBecause no man would dye his hair pink unless some nice pair of legs told him it would look cute. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesus dumps the coins out of the basket and starts counting. He isn\u2019t looking at me because he knows he\u2019s right. The day we went to get the dye, I wanted something less radical, maybe blond or a soft green, but Dolphin picked out the box of pink with purpose and told me that this was it, and like a heroin addict I was all in.\n\n\u201c$11.34!\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThat barely covers the cost of the doughnuts. I should play that number.\u201d He reaches over and grabs a small slip of paper and a pen, and I assume he writes down 1-1-3-4.\n\n\u201cYou gamble?\u201d I say, which even catches me off guard, considering that he has been talking to me about pussy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d He says. \u201cLife is a gamble and if someone has to win, why not Brother Krall?! You got to walk before you Krall.\u201d And Jesus laughs, and I don\u2019t get any of it.\n\n\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you think those old folks that came to see me today, how you think they feel now?\u201d\n\nThis felt like a trick. Some kind of question that he already asked me in a previous life where I had never met Dolphin or dyed my hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d I say, knowing that this is the response he wants and the one that feels easiest to give.\n\n\u201cYou damn right. Each one of them paid a dollar to feel better, and you think they got their money\u2019s worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou damn right they did.\u201d\n\nHe grabs the doughnut basket. \u201cSee, this here is short money; the real money is down the road when times get tough. I\u2019m with them now so that when everyone else leaves them, they know they still have me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when you stick it to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jesus says, patting the pocket of his blazer.\n\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d he says, holding a pack of Newport 100s towards me.\n\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\nHe pulls out a long cigarette, lights it and puts his shoes on the desk.\n\n\u201cSo I know how to save them,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThey\u2019re easy. They\u2019re ready to be saved; in fact, they\u2019re begging for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe takes a drag. \u201cThe real question is, how do I save you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny, since I didn\u2019t know I was lost.\u201d\n\nJesus blows out smoke.\n\n\u201cWe all are. The question is always, how do we get found? Maybe you find it in your music or whatever, but don\u2019t think for a second that you aren\u2019t looking. That\u2019s why pussy is so important. You never knew you needed it until you started getting it, and then when she takes it back \u2026 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m strung out,\u201d I say.\n\nHe shakes his head and smiles.\n\nAnd there is that tooth saying that Jesus is right again. Until I found Fishbone or Fishbone found me, I was lost. When I first heard Truth and Soul, I knew I was home. And before Dolphin and I had sex, I just thought she was cool; after that night in her car, I thought she was amazing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do anything but come back next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what happens next week?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou come in and set up the chairs and get the doughnuts straight, and in turn I teach you about faith \u2026 the great unexplainable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m a choirboy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you call yourself; I just need somebody to get the chairs set up. We got a deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess.\u201d And Jesus takes his cigarette and puts it in the corner of his mouth and leans his ringed hand across the desk and we shake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow get out of here before you start crying.\u201d\n\nI laugh and walk out of the office, into the cafeteria and out the door to my mother\u2019s car.\n\n\u201cSo how did it go?\u201d she says.\n\nI don\u2019t feel right talking to her about what me and Jesus discussed\u2014it was personal\u2014but I know she won\u2019t move the car unless I say something. I think about telling her that he isn\u2019t who she thinks he is, but instead I look down at my phone to see if Dolphin called and she hasn\u2019t, and for a second I don\u2019t feel as lonely as I did before.

Starting with the originals in the late 1960s and \u201970s and extending to the reboots starting in 2011, the films have a sort of hackneyed white-liberal-pontificates-about-race element to them that is at times compelling and other times insulting.\n\nApes, even superintelligent apes, as a proxy for black America\u2019s struggle for liberation (as opposed to robots or elephants or superhero mutants) is a little tone-deaf, given the sustained racist associations between blacks and monkeys. Either way, with War for the Planet of the Apes opening this weekend, the movie stepped into controversy by not just aping the struggle for black liberation but possibly straight appropriating it.\n\n\n\nDid War for the Planet of the Apes model the Bad Ape character after Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson? It certainly looks like it, and given Hollywood\u2019s racist history, it\u2019s not crazy that some people think so.\n\n\n\nOn Monday morning, Tariq Nasheed, the left foot of Hotep-Twitter Voltron, tweeted the following poster from the upcoming movie:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe image started making its way around Twitter and Facebook, accomplishing something that Hotep appearances on Roland Martin\u2019s show, The Breakfast Club and even Dr. Boyce Watkins\u2019 show couldn\u2019t accomplish: It brought Hotep Twitter and mainstream Black Twitter together. Although there were some doubters about the racist nature of the new movie\u2019s imagery, like St. Louis City Alderman, and representative of the sunken-place district, Antonio French.\n\nMost folks saw the image as being a bit too close to Mckesson\u2019s Patagonia-vest-wearing-activist image to think it was a fashion coincidence in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Monday night, Mckesson had stepped into the discussion, making it clear that he didn\u2019t feel flattered:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich led defenders of the movie, including right-wing film directors, to justify the blue vest as an homage to the original 1968 film.\n\nWhich, of course, Black Twitter wasn\u2019t trying to hear. We aren\u2019t falling for the banana in the tailpipe again, especially when there are real monkeys involved:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story actually ended up on The View, with Whoopi Goldberg, brandishing her Ph.D. in whitesplaining from Caucasity University, slamming Mckesson for not knowing film history\u2014but still conveniently neglecting to mention that Planet of the Apes movies have always been about race. All of this over a movie that, likely, nobody in these various conversations has actually seen yet.\n\nI\u2019ve seen every Planet of the Apes movie, and I saw War for Planet of the Apes at a press screening, in a mostly black theater, in Atlanta, with a very black friend. I enjoyed it and didn\u2019t see anything negatively racial about it. And this is coming from a guy who thought Spider-Man: Homecoming was racist.\n\nNothing about the Bad Ape character, including his blue coat (it\u2019s more of a coat than a vest in the movie), made me think of Mckesson, Campaign Zero or Black Lives Matter. None of the CGI monkeys screamed #ApeLivesMatter. Caesar didn\u2019t put out a #BringBackOurGorillas sign when the Human Army, led by the crazy Colonel (a phoned-in mad-military-guy performance by Woody Harrelson), captured some of the apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to this controversy, my review was focused on how most of the series\u2019 political messaging about the environment, animal rights and race was wrung out of War for Planet of the Apes. That being said, people mad about the movie aren\u2019t wrong.\n\nThere are few items of clothing more inextricably linked to one person than DeRay Mckesson and his blue Patagonia vest. Michael Jackson and his sequined glove, Pharrell Williams and that Hat, maybe former President Barack Obama\u2019s khaki Easter Sunday deacon outfit. Mckesson\u2019s blue vest has its own Twitter account, it went to the BET Awards and there\u2019s legitimate symbolism behind why McKesson wears it.\n\n\n\nIf you saw a Disney musical featuring a monkey wearing a sequined glove, you\u2019d think of Jackson, and you\u2019d be wondering who dressed that monkey and why it had its own pet monkey. The point is, Mckesson and the thousands of people who saw the image and thought of him are not crazy or conspiracy theorists; they reflect Mckesson\u2019s incredible brand penetration.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly: WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE. American popular culture is full of examples of insulting characters made to look or sound black even when they are ostensibly something else: Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, Skids and Mudflap from Transformers, Ben Carson. The list goes on and on. Between Mckesson\u2019s brand, Hollywood racism and the fact that the entire Apes franchise is supposed to be an allegory for American race relations, many people reached the reasonable conclusion that War for the Planet of the Apes came for Mckesson.\n\nIf you choose to see the movie, you\u2019ll probably come away with a different impression, however. War for the Planet of the Apes is basically a postapocalyptic action movie at this point, and a pretty entertaining one. The movie shows the frighteningly quick evolution of the apes as characters. In earlier films they could only make ape sounds; now they use sign language. Those who knew sign language now talk; and Caesar, the ape leader, is giving Obama-level oratory and is playing the dozens with human adversaries.\n\nThe movie works best when it weaves together great elements from the original movies and explains, through a slow-burning and disturbing mystery, how monkeys and human beings could switch places on the intellectual pyramid in just under 20 years. This movie isn\u2019t the racial catharsis of watching apes strike a Django-like blow against their human (i.e., white) oppressors. Humanity has already lost to the apes; it just spends two hours trying to accept it. Outside of the occasional 101 Dalmatians-Smurfs problem (in some scenes, there are thousands of apes in Caesar\u2019s group; at other times, they could barely field a basketball team), it\u2019s the best movie of the reboot series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who chooses not to see War for the Planet of the Apes because he or she believes it\u2019s a secret attempt by the Hollywood Illuminati to lure black folks into a sense of complacency has every right to skip this one. Anyone who doesn\u2019t see the movie because he or she believes that the producers of a movie about historic racial discrimination should have known better than to put a monkey in a blue coat or vest can skip it, too. (It\u2019s worth noting that Mckesson actually deleted his tweet critiquing the film poster.)\n\nHeck, anyone who just can\u2019t stand the idea of being indirectly in agreement with Whoopi Goldberg on a racial issue can take a hard pass as well. But take it from someone who gives racial side eye to just about any science fiction film: I think War for the Planet of the Apes passes the smell test. However, given Hollywood\u2019s history, if you want to teach it a lesson to be more careful in the future, that makes perfect sense to me. Hollywood has made more than enough money off of putting black pain in a monkey suit.", "keywords": ["vest", "think", "movie", "deray", "war", "far", "twitter", "black", "come", "apes", "racial", "hotep", "mckesson", "planet"], "polarity": 0.06620179063360881, "subjectivity": 0.4371971664698937},

The American-based worldwide clothing-and-accessories retailer, long known for its diverse casting and fresh, fashion-forward campaigns featuring basics like jeans, khakis and tees, just gave us another reason to love it with a sweet and subtle nod to breast-feeding moms.\n\nDuring a recent sleepwear shoot for the brand, Nigerian-American model Adaora Akubilo was modeling with her 20-month-old son, Arinze, when she sensed that he was hungry. As Akubilo told the Chicago Tribune, she asked for a break to nurse him:\n\n\u201cI let them know,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, my God, of course it\u2019s OK, go ahead. ... You can do it right here.\u2019\u201d She went on to explain, \u201cI\u2019m so comfortable just nursing my son anywhere. If my son needs to nurse, I\u2019m going to nurse him.\u201d\n\nAkubilo proceeded to nurse on the set. Witnessing the beautiful and perfectly natural moment between mother and son, the photographer asked if they could continue shooting.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Akubilo replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the beautiful shots captured in that moment became one of the featured shots in Gap\u2019s spring campaign, which the brand also posted on its Instagram page. Over 39,000 likes later, the support for the image has been overwhelming, with fellow breast-feeding moms lauding the brand for normalizing a biological maternal act that is often still seen as taboo.\n\nThis taboo holds even truer for black women, who have long been stuck with the stigma that we don\u2019t breast-feed. Despite medical evidence that the \u201cbreast is best\u201d for newborns and infants, as of 2008, black infants still typically had the lowest rate of breast-feeding initiation. [Editor\u2019s note: While we were looking for a stock image for this article, the only images available of breast-feeding black mothers were National Geographic-style photos of African tribal women naked from the waist up.]\n\nOrganizations like Black Women Do Breastfeed and the Black Mothers\u2019 Breastfeeding Association have risen in response, providing support, information and encouragement for new mothers who choose to breast-feed. And last December, a group photo of the Birmingham, Ala., breast-feeding collective Chocolate Milk Mommies went viral. As one of its members, Rauslyn Adams, told People magazine: \u201cIt is taboo within the African-American home to breastfeed your child, let alone to do it past the age of 1. ... Breastfeeding has been seen by some African American women as reverting to \u2018slavery days\u2019 when feeding a child by breast was the only option.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkubilo has faced her own stigmas and shaming, admitting to the Tribune that she has repeatedly been asked why she has continued to nurse Arinze past his first six months, as she\u2019d initially planned.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was doing something wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cOur society in particular is not very supportive of women who nurse after a certain age.\u201d\n\nBut Akubilo is letting her son guide the process, along with the support of his pediatrician, who has impressed upon her the many health benefits of continued breast-feeding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Gap showing its support with a now viral campaign photo of Akibulo nursing, she told the Tribune that she hopes it helps to support and inspire other women to do the same.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want women to feel shamed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to encourage mothers.\u201d", "keywords": ["takes", "breastfeed", "son", "tribune", "gap", "taboo", "black", "nurse", "akubilo", "campaign", "gets", "retailer", "mothers", "women", "support", "breastfeeding"], "polarity": 0.15208957708957707, "subjectivity": 0.48430447103916496},

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That. Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts? Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

The city she lived in and schools she attended were mostly white. But when she moved to Campinas, a city of 1 million approximately two hours outside of Sao Paulo, she decided to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI wanted to increase my connection to Afro-Brazilian people,\u201d she says.\n\nThaisa joined Afrodengo, an Afro-Brazilian dating community on Facebook. When she finally got up the nerve to post her photo and introduced herself\u2014a requirement of the community\u2014she noticed that one guy who \u201cliked\u201d her photo lived in her city. His name was Jackson Xavier.\n\nShe reached out to him on Facebook and they immediately started talking. Two days later, they went out on their first date. She instantly liked his intelligence, responsibility and the way he cared for her. He liked her stubbornness, humor and intelligence as well. Five months later, the couple were married. As Jackson explains:\n\nBefore the group, I didn\u2019t even think to look for relationships with black women, and I had never had a black girlfriend. But once I entered the group, I started to focus more on having a relationship with a black person like me because we have similar experiences. The black movement is very strong on the internet, so I entered the group wanting to see more beautiful black people and to have references in my life to black things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrodengo was created one year ago by Afro-Brazilian journalist and single mother Lorena If\u00e9, 29, to promote love and marriage among Afro-Brazilians. \u201cDengo\u201d is a word with African roots that Brazilians\u2014especially Afro-Brazilians\u2014call people to show love and care. Despite the country\u2019s African origins, hundreds of years of slavery and European colonialism have made affection and stable relationships between black women and black men in Brazil unique and unusual.\n\nNow Afro-Brazilians are flocking to the Afrodengo Facebook group to build relationships that they never before considered having. But If\u00e9 not only wants to spark love among Afro-Brazilians; she also wants to help them build relationships with one another so that they can combat racism in Brazil. She explains:\n\nHaving relationships between black people is a way to combat racism. Only a black person will know how racism affects you and its consequences in our lives. In a society where we learn to hate ourselves, if we unite with people like us, then we can combat racism with something as simple as having a conscious family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo jump-start the group, If\u00e9 invited Afro-Brazilian men and women to post photos and descriptions of themselves. Within a week, it exploded\u2014with both members and photos. At one point, If\u00e9 had more than 10,000 people waiting to be approved to the group. If\u00e9 created an environment where every type of black person, regardless of sexuality, sex, religion or political viewpoint, is welcome.\n\nToday the group is still going strong; having produced at least two marriages and countless couples and friendships. There are more than 100,000 members in the main group and its affiliates (which focus on LGBT members, Christians and body positivity). If\u00e9 plans to turn the Facebook group into an app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Afro-Brazilians enjoy the group, some white Brazilians consider If\u00e9 and the group racist because it is exclusively for black people. For African Americans, a dating site for black people seems obvious. But for Brazilians, communities restricted by race are always frowned upon. White Brazilians also want to be a part of the group.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I have to deny entrance to white people who want to join the group,\u201d If\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Afrodengo stems from If\u00e9\u2019s personal experiences pursuing amor afrocentrado\u2014\u201dblack love\u201d\u2014 in Salvador, Brazil. While in a relationship with her son\u2019s father, she felt that their relationship lacked the affection she sees given to white women in Brazil. Soon after they broke up, she tried her hand at online dating and even created a profile on Tinder. But although she lives in a city that is more than 80 percent black, she couldn\u2019t find any black men on the platform.\n\nIf\u00e9 says she wasn\u2019t raised with affection\u2014which is common among poor Afro-Brazilians simply trying to survive. Personally, she longs for a black man who will cherish her intelligence and give her affection when she wants\u2014even when she doesn\u2019t need it. She still longs for an \u201cAfrodengo.\u201d\n\nCreating this Afrodengo [was] a way to help me survive and help others going through a similar situation. It helped me to move on from my relationship and survive my depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9\u2019s struggle is one that many black women in Brazil share. Many of their lives are marked by loneliness (solid\u00e3o da Mulher Negra) because they aren\u2019t chosen\u2014the chosen women being white women. In Brazil, black and mixed-race women have been traditionally oversexualized or looked upon as domestic servants, while white women are viewed as the perfect women to give affection to and to have a healthy marriage with. It is a given that the more money and education an Afro-Brazilian has, the more likely he will marry a white woman.\n\nTranslating from a YouTube video by anthropologist Ana Cl\u00e1udia Pacheco, a professor at the State University of Bahia:\n\nBecause of historical reasons related to racism, many black women in Brazil suffer from solitude. ... Our choices in who we give affection to and who we choose as a partner are still regulated by and structured by racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Afrodengo isn\u2019t just for creating romantic relationships; Afro-Brazilian men and women are using the group to strengthen their black identity and create friendships with Afro-Brazilians across Brazil. Says early adopter Gabriel Rangel, 25, from Rio de Janeiro:\n\nI still haven\u2019t found a relationship through Afrodengo, but now I have friends all over the country, and the group has really opened my mind to the Black Movement in Brazil.\n\nMember Lais Mello entered the group one week after it launched. Adopted by a white family, she\u2019d lacked a strong connection to Afro-Brazilian culture. She created the first city-specific WhatsApp group for Afrodengo, which helped her organize meetups in Salvador and make friends with Afro-Brazilians close to her town in Bahia. Now Mello is a moderator of the group, and credits Afrodengo with increasing her self-esteem and pulling her out of depression:\n\nBefore Afrodengo, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because of my depression and anxiety. My self-esteem was so low. But now I love going to Afrodengo meetups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9 has grand plans for the Afrodengo brand. The first thing she wants to do is get off of Facebook and create an app for the group. She\u2019s currently looking for funding and support, and plans to apply to the Vale de Dend\u00ea accelerator, which is targeting Afro-Brazilian startups based in Salvador.", "keywords": ["brazil", "white", "afrodengo", "relationships", "easier", "style", "black", "group", "afrobrazilians", "afrobrazilian", "if\u00e9", "making", "women", "love"], "polarity": 0.10571208112874778, "subjectivity": 0.43239417989417983},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall.

Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways.

He successfully protested to desegregate Philadelphia\u2019s trolleys, he fought to pass constitutional amendments enfranchising black citizens, and then he worked to bring those new black voters to the polls.\ufeff\n\nCatto was assassinated in 1871\u2014only six years after the Civil War ended\u2014when gangs of armed white Philadelphians took to the streets to prevent black people from voting. That year\u2019s was the first election in which the city\u2019s black men could participate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Philadelphia magazine, Catto was shot twice in the back by a white man after sending teachers and students at his school home early that day, lest they encounter any violence. He was 32.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon in Philadelphia, 146 years after he was gunned down two doors away from his house, a monument to Catto will be unveiled at City Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Philly.com reports, Catto\u2019s likeness will be the first public monument to honor a specific black American on the city\u2019s public landscape, and the first statue to go up at City Hall in nearly a century.\n\nCatto\u2019s statue is officially titled A Quest for Parity and is the work of Branley Cadet, a black artist based out of California.\n\nCadet recognizes that the site on which the monument will be erected was \u201ctransformed\u201d by Catto\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey fought to desegregate the trolley cars,\u201d Cadet told Philly.com about the civil rights leader and his contemporaries. \u201cThey fought to ratify the 15th Amendment. So the world I live in is very different from the world Octavius Catto lived in.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney acknowledges that the lack of knowledge about black historical figures isn\u2019t accidental.\n\n\u201cI think Malcolm X was right when he was quoted as saying, I\u2019m paraphrasing, that the deeds of black people in this country have been systematically removed, the pages have been ripped out of the history books on purpose,\u201d Kenney told Philly.com, adding that respect between different groups isn\u2019t possible without first respecting everybody\u2019s efforts to improve American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know \u2026 about the African-American contribution to Philadelphia or the United States, then you can\u2019t mutually appreciate how everybody contributed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nRead more at philly.com.", "keywords": ["phillycom", "monument", "american", "black", "philadelphia", "catto", "fought", "rights", "tribute", "pay", "hero", "forgotten", "city", "civil", "desegregate"], "polarity": 0.07960431381484015, "subjectivity": 0.3706981468823574},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways.

Brown) on NBC\u2019s This Is Us are just the representation of #BlackLove that viewers need.\n\nThe Pearsons offer something viewers haven\u2019t seen for some time (if ever): a healthy black relationship on a prime-time drama, offering a portrayal that is more real and layered than what decades of sitcoms have depicted, making it relatable for many. Here are 10 reasons they\u2019re TV\u2019s latest couple obsession.\n\n1. Love of Family\n\nThe Pearsons have a lot of priorities to balance, but when it comes to familial responsibilities, the scale is so far tipped in that direction, it\u2019s leaning like Fat Joe. It\u2019s clear that family comes first for them like sweet potato pie comes before pumpkin on the black hierarchy of autumn desserts. Nothing is more important to Randall and Beth than their family, and that begins with the love the two share. When that\u2019s where it should be, the rest is easy.\n\n2. Parenting\n\nOf course, not every couple has children, but just about anyone watching Randall and Beth would want to either parent like them or have parents like them. They argue over who\u2019s loved most by their two daughters, and each recognizes the role they play in their kids\u2019 lives. There\u2019s mutual respect and shared authority that has resulted in two smart, precocious children who are open to everything from a gay grandfather (RIP) to a new big sister.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Team Spirit\n\nEven when Randall\u2019s skies are gray, Beth rubs him on his back and says, \u201cBaby, it will be OK.\u201d Clearly, some women would react differently after learning their husband, the breadwinner, spontaneously quit his job or suddenly wanted to adopt a child, but Beth has done nothing but support Randall\u2019s decisions, finding compromises with which they could both live. That\u2019s not so hard when you realize your man\u2019s good intentions and that whatever he decides, it won\u2019t eclipse what\u2019s best for you two.\n\n4. Witty Banter\n\nYou can\u2019t get more in accord than when you and your spouse are finishing each other\u2019s sentences. Beth and Randall\u2019s dialogue is so in sync, one wonders why they even bother to speak. Can\u2019t they just read each other\u2019s thoughts and communicate telepathically at this point? However, it\u2019s fun to watch the ease of their exchanges (and the telepathy might make it hard for This Is Us fans to follow). They know they can say whatever they want to each other with the bluntness of Kyle and Maxine, but with the touching thoughtfulness of Synclaire and Overton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Sense of Humor\n\nWith two girls to raise, a foster teen added to the family, a recent loss of a parent, conflicts with extended family members and the everyday struggles of living while black in America, it\u2019s a wonder Beth and Randall aren\u2019t balled up crying in a corner somewhere like anyone who\u2019s ever asked Iyanla Vanzant to fix their life. To offset the hardships, the two ease the tension every now and again with a few jokes. Finding the humor in some not-so-funny situations keeps the beloved couple feeling more Def Jam than damned.\n\n\n\n6. Transparency/Honesty\n\nWhen Beth learns a secret that could devastate her husband, she\u2019s not about keeping it to herself despite pleas from Randall\u2019s father. Honesty is their policy, and though the truth might hurt him, she\u2019s not about to add to the pain by being implicit in the cover-up. Randall trusts his best friend and partner, and she\u2019s giving him no reason to doubt that he should. Randall also recognizes the importance of keeping it real with his wife. So, while suddenly quitting his job or hitting the road to Tennessee might baffle those who don\u2019t know him as well, it\u2019s what Beth expects from the man she knows.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Wokeness\n\nThey may have assimilated into mainstream society seamlessly, but make no mistake: Beth and Randall remain extremely woke. From pointing out how no black man is ever jealous of others being auctioned off for charity (\u201chashtag: American history\u201d) to Beth\u2019s stylish natural hairdos, the Pearsons have unapologetically embraced their African-American heritage like a modern-day George and Weezy who\u2019ve moved on up but remember the struggle.\n\n8. Romance\n\nWho has time for loving with all the tear-jerking drama that is This Is Us? Randall and Beth do. Lucky for us, that\u2019s what they like. Whether they\u2019re just copping feels around the kitchen island or stealing away for a weekend in a luxury hotel suite, the two make sure to find time to keep things sexy, which isn\u2019t hard with this attractive pair. The couple may remind fans that sometimes effort and creativity are needed to keep the flames burning, and it\u2019s totally worth it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Chemistry\n\nFind someone who looks at you the way Beth and Randall look at each other. There\u2019s romance and then there\u2019s chemistry, which seems to come naturally for these actors and their characters. They\u2019re more adorable than Ruby and Ossie (RIP), and we hope they\u2019re together as long. With the flashbacks and flash-forwards This Is Us is known for, viewers may get a chance to see the older, silver-haired version of the two\u2014or, better yet, a spinoff!\n\n\n\n10. Black Love\n\nThere have been depictions of it on network TV before: James and Florida, Dwayne and Whitley, Martin and Gina, but with the exception of a few daytime-soap-opera love stories (shoutout to Neil and Dru and Angie and Jesse), viewers haven\u2019t seen many black-love portrayals in dramas. Without the laugh track and the need to tie everything up in a tight bow in 22 minutes, there\u2019s more to explore in a realistic way to which many viewers can relate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus: Brandall\n\nIt hasn\u2019t caught on yet, but who doesn\u2019t like a moniker merge? It doesn\u2019t fit for every couple. There\u2019s no one-word nickname for Will and Jada (Wada?) or even Barack and Michelle (Mirack?), but \u201cBrandall\u201d works for Beth and Randall. That\u2019s almost as official as marriage vows.

That led to meeting Eileen Ford, the legendary owner of Ford Models. At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle.

It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award. The current university president apologized, asked me to crown the new homecoming queen and to join the advisory board.\n\nDaphne Maxwell is crowned homecoming queen of Northwestern University in 1967.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite.

It was 1968 or 1969, when Ladies Home Journal was a big magazine. Supermodel Cheryl Tiegs was in that picture.\n\n\n\nTGU: The path from model to actress seems to have been easy for you.\n\n\n\nDMR: I was a curious, adventurous woman. I had no qualms about walking through another door.

I would like to learn about her life before 1880 but have so few clues. She had one daughter, Annie Lundy, my grandmother. The 1880 census shows her as a widow and that her parents were from Georgia. She would have likely been born a slave around 1850-1853, somewhere in Georgia. She died Dec. 14, 1921, in Macon, Ga. I learned a few things about Cora from 1900 on, but nothing before the 1880 census record.\n\nThrough my research I have learned that she worked and lived for over 40 years at the Cannonball House in Macon. The Cannonball House is on the Register of Historic Places. Ten years ago I visited the Cannonball House and took the tour and saw the place where she lived and worked. The house is associated with the Alpha Delta Phi and Phi Mu sororities, and its restoration was funded by the Daughters of the Confederacy. The Cannonball House staff have been helpful but have little information about Cora beyond what I provided. The only picture my family ever had of our great-grandmother was provided from the records of the Cannonball House. Can you help? \u2014Jackie Belt\n\nThe Cannonball House was built in 1853 by Judge Asa Holt. Richard Iobst\u2019s book Civil War Macon: The History of a Confederate City describes Holt as being a planter who was \u201cone of Macon\u2019s best-known citizens\u201d and supported the Confederacy. The house received its nickname because a cannonball landed in its parlor during the Battle of Dunlap\u2019s Hill in 1864. According to the National Park Service:\n\nDuring the siege of Atlanta, Union Cavalry General George Stoneman conducted a raid on Central Georgia cutting the Confederate supply line and the Central Georgia railroad. Stoneman and his troops destroyed everything in their path on their way to Macon. Stoneman\u2019s personal mission was to destroy the city and free Union officers imprisoned at Camp Oglethorpe. Fighting took place on July 30th when Stoneman ordered the city bombarded and his troops to advance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the shells fired landed in the Holt residence. However, the family survived, and Confederate troops under Gen. Howell Cobb repelled the attack by Union soldiers.\n\nCora\u2019s Life at Cannonball House\n\nSince learning more about the home\u2019s owners can lead to information about Cora Lundy\u2019s early life, we started our search by tracing them. Asa Holt married Nora M. Burck on March 25, 1862. In his last will and testament dated June 6, 1867, Asa Holt did not provide any details of his estate other than to say that it should go to his beloved wife, Norah M. Holt, in its entirety. Nora M. Holt married Charles Canning on Jan. 28, 1874, and the house passed into the Canning family. These are all names you will want to keep in mind during your research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you may know, in 1880 Cora Lundy was working as a servant in the household of Charles Canning in Macon, Bibb, Ga. She worked for this family for a number of decades: She was recorded with them in 1900, along with her daughter, Annie Lundy, and again in 1910, when Lizzie Canning was the head of household. In each of these records, Charles Canning\u2019s daughter and grandchildren appear with the Martin surname, so it suggests that Cora was still employed by the same family when she was in the household of the Martin family in 1920.\n\nIn these records, she was residing on Mulberry Street in Macon, and from 1900 forward, the address is given as 856 Mulberry St. This is still the address of the Cannonball House today, meaning that Cora was employed in the house at least from 1880 forward. This does not mean that she was there during the Civil War or before that date.\n\nFinding Cora\u2014and More Clues\u2014Before 1880\n\nWe expanded the search terms to see whether Cora was recorded under a different name before 1880. Using just the first name, \u201cCora,\u201d with a birth date of about 1850 and residing in Macon, Bibb, Ga., we found her living in the household of Cherry Stubbs in 1870. Her name had been transcribed into the index incorrectly as \u201cSundry\u201d instead of \u201cLundy,\u201d but her age, place of birth and location are all consistent with your Cora.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone in this household was African American, and all were born in Georgia. The head of household, Cherry Stubbs, was a 34-year-old woman, and 12-year-old James Stubbs was likely her son. Also in the household were a 6-year-old, Jos. A. Smith, and a 42-year-old man named Kitt Blackshear. Investigating any of these people further may reveal more about Cora. At least now you know where she was before 1880, and with whom.\n\nWe took a closer look at Cherry Stubbs, who was recorded in the household of her son, J.A. Smith, in Vineville, Bibb County, Ga., in 1900. The record states that she was born in 1837 and was a widow. She had given birth to two children and both were still living. J.A. Smith is likely the Jos. A. Smith who was in Cherry Stubbs\u2019 household in 1870, suggesting that both James Stubbs and Jos. A. Smith were children of Cherry Stubbs.\n\nWith Jos. A. Smith\u2019s name, we were able to locate Cherry in 1880, recorded as Cherry Sweet in Macon. Since the record states that Cherry had only two children whom we can account for in records, it is unlikely that your Cora Lundy was her daughter. However, the fact that the two women were living together closely following emancipation and remained in Bibb County for many decades suggests that they were closely associated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou may also want to see who else shared the Lundy surname in Macon, Bibb County, in 1870. These may also be relatives or close associates of your Cora Lundy. One record we saw included a Mary Lundy and an Adeline Lundy in the household of Betsy Cherry (transcribed as \u201cCheny\u201d). We noted this record not only because these individuals were in Macon and shared the Lundy surname but also because they were residing in the household of someone with the surname Cherry and had a girl in the household with the Holt surname.\n\n\n\nDid Cherry Stubbs receive her given name from a surname, and did she have a connection to the Holt family who owned the Cannonball House? An examination of the original record reveals that this Lundy-Cherry household was directly next door to a white family with William A. Cherry as the head of household, and also next to African-American families bearing the Lundy and Holt surnames.\n\nWas She Enslaved at Cannonball House?\n\nTo see if any of these individuals had a connection to the Cannonball House prior to 1880, let\u2019s go back to examining Judge Asa Holt and kin. In 1860, Asa Holt was recorded in Macon, Bibb County, age 70 and having been born in North Carolina. Also in the household was Mary Holt, presumably his wife prior to Norah M. Burck. Based on the history of the house, it is safe to assume that they were living in the Cannonball House when this census was recorded. In the enumeration, Asa Holt was recorded as dwelling in house No. 718. Interestingly, on the previous page was the household of Job. H. Cherry, dwelling in house No. 715.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the 1860 United States Census Slave Schedule (via Ancestry.com; subscription required), Asa Holt owned 25 slaves that year. None were girls recorded between the ages of 9 and 12 who could match the description of your Cora Lundy, but with such limited information in the record, it is impossible to know for certain whether she is excluded from being enslaved by him. We also noted that Job. H. Cherry was recorded with nine slaves in his household, and we suggest that you consider this household, too.\n\nWe also noted in the slave schedules a slave owner named William Lundy who owned slaves in Howards District, Bibb County, Ga. This area is currently a district within Macon, where your Cora Lundy is known to have lived later in life. There were also girls in his household who could be a match for your Cora Lundy. It is best to investigate all possibilities before ruling out anything.\n\nSince Cora Lundy was not residing in the household of an employer in 1870, shortly following emancipation, it is not clear if she lived at the Cannonball House prior to her employment with the Canning family by 1880. Your best option for working even further back in time would be to search for records of the potential former slave owners Asa Holt, William Lundy and Job. H. Cherry. Land, probate, account, tax or court records for each of these individuals during slavery may include information about their slaves and may help you determine where Cora was living during slavery.

It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir!

Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated.

Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life.

About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah.

When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land.

My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

But it\u2019s also time to reckon with the fact that our rightful adoration for Cardi B reveals a troubling truth: We dismiss, denigrate and force white-appeasing standards on black and Latinx women like her every day, then pretend to love them when they achieve fame.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, my love for Cardi B knows no bounds. Last month I went to the club for a night of drinks, dancing and hookah-smoking with a few close friends. This wasn\u2019t an unusual weekly tradition, but we always made an experience out of it: pregame and a night out in our best outfits, followed by a night of the greasiest food known to humankind. As luck would have it, the moment we stepped out of the car and into the club, Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow (Money Moves)\u201d was glaring from the speakers. It was as if God herself were blessing us from the high heavens.\n\n\n\nBut then something happened that made me pause: The entire club\u2014filled with hundreds of people\u2014rapped along to the song, too. It was as if I had entered another universe full of Cardi B fans who couldn\u2019t get enough of our nonbloodied bloody shoes. I was shook. It was in this moment that I realized Cardi B was ours\u2014not in a way of ownership, but in a way of understanding that the former star of VH1\u2019s Love & Hip Hop was here to stay. That night is when I knew that Cardi B had unintentionally crossed over into the mainstream and, therefore, white media outlets.\n\n\n\nIn case it wasn\u2019t clear, I love Cardi B. She\u2019s Afro-Latina, hood, speaks her mind and will rightfully pop off with minimal talking. Many didn\u2019t believe in her craft; her recent song started near the bottom of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 but is now the No. 3 song in the country just seven weeks after its release. Cardi B can also claim to have the No. 1 rap song in the country.\n\n\n\nAs we\u2019re going all the way up for Cardi B, it doesn\u2019t escape me that we see people like her often\u2014they are on the block, in school, on the Metro, in our families and maybe in our close circles. But we stay away. Many of us usually reject these same black and Latinx women and girls because they have yet to experience fame. We call them \u201cghetto,\u201d suck our teeth at their mannerisms, tell them to quiet down and force respectability politics down their throats. Fortunately, they learn to reject those notions because they plan to be themselves no matter what many of us say.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, it\u2019s time to ask ourselves: If we can appreciate Cardi B, why can\u2019t we do the same for someone like her who isn\u2019t famous? Why can\u2019t we do it for someone on the street who is figuring out how to survive?\n\n\n\nI live in Washington, D.C., and witness my fair share of respectability politics on a daily basis. Any day, I can walk down the street of this increasingly gentrifying and transient city (because, to be clear, it\u2019s different for native Washingtonians) and witness the notion of respectability rear its ugly head. This is especially visible on the Metro when young black and Latinx girls come onto the train, being expressive and full of life, listening to music loudly (often without headsets). Far too many of us see them, disrespectfully engage and tell them to silence themselves (usually for the appeasement of white onlookers), but then we give love to people who act like these young women when they are famous.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m guilty of this, and so are you.\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if we stopped ignoring and dismissing our cousins who act like those famous people we love?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to protect black and Latinx women\u2014those who continually fight for us, those who are attempting to share their experiences the best way they know how, those whom people tell to quiet down. And this is why it\u2019s necessary to stop treating people like caricatures and start investing in the totality of their experiences.\n\n\n\nI love Cardi B because she is like so many people I know and helped raise me. It doesn\u2019t mean she (or anyone) is perfect\u2014as was clear with her past tweets that referred to some dark-skinned women as \u201croaches\u201d\u2014but perfection isn\u2019t a requirement for lending support. She isn\u2019t disposable, and neither are the black and Latinx people we see every day.\n\n\n\nSupporting people who look like us doesn\u2019t only matter when we see someone experiencing fame. It\u2019s supporting women and queer, transgender and other marginalized people who express themselves a little differently despite what society may say.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe deserve Cardi B as much as we deserve the people we ignore every day.

For some, it\u2019s a patriotic symbol of their southern American heritage. For many others, though, the Confederate flag is a painful reminder that America\u2019s is a legacy steeped in the blood, pain, and misery of black slaves and their still-living descendants.\n\nToday, state legislators across the South are being forced to deal with a passionate debate over the \u201cstars and bars.\u201d Both sides of the Confederate flag issue are fighting over just what it means to have the flag and monuments of Civil War-era, Confederate-aligned historical figures displayed in public spaces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fight, at its core, is over whether the desires of the people who support the presence of these symbols outweigh the concerns of those who see them as constant reminders of the South\u2019s investment in the enslavement and subjugation of black people as economic and cultural institutions. It\u2019s a bitter and impassioned conflict that stands as a reflection of our larger current political climate and as a reminder that we\u2019ve still yet to fully come to grips with the fallout of the Civil War as a country.\n\nThis is what makes it so difficult to see a project like HBO\u2019s Confederate as anything but an ill-advised endeavor. The brainchild of Game of Thrones alums David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Confederate is an alternative history drama set in a world where the South seceded from the North after a second Civil War. Though slavery is outlawed in Confederate\u2019s North, it\u2019s alive and well in the show\u2019s South and simmering tensions between the nations are well on their way to developing into an all-out third conflict.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me be clear: There is a rich history of using alternative histories and speculative fiction to examine the realities of our world in ways that, to some, might not be immediately apparent.\n\nPart of what makes watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in 2017 so enthralling and terrifying are the countless little things about the Republic of Gilead that make it seem like a plausible, though wild future that our nation could face in one of the darkest possible timelines. But the thing that has always made The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019s dystopian vision of the future so profound is the depth of Margaret Atwood\u2019s imagination.\n\nWhile the idea of the Nazis winning World War II is a large part of what initially fascinates people about The Man in the High Castle, but what ultimately ends up being most interesting about the book and Amazon\u2019s live-action adaptation are the ways in which the Axis\u2019 victory shapes the entire world after the war. After losing to the Axis, the U.S. is split into the Greater Nazi Reich and the Japanese Pacific States, two discrete and distinct nations that reflect a world in which American culture\u2019s dominance in the west has been toppled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a rich history of using alternative histories and speculative fiction to examine the realities of our world in ways that, to some, might not be immediately apparent.\ufeff\n\nThe San Francisco that we see in The Man in the High Castle bears a number of similarities to our own, but the Japanese occupation has fundamentally reshaped the social and cultural landscape of the city in important ways. In this San Francisco, it is the Japanese whose privilege allows them to move effortless through the world as members of the preferred society and white Americans who are looked down upon. Japanese food and architecture are the new norms that everyone exists with while \u201ctraditionally American\u201d culture has become a quaint throwback that the upper class sometimes engage in for fun.\n\nThe real magic and power of alternate histories and speculative fiction lies in the \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if the Axis powers had won World War II? What if, after an inexplicable plague renders the world\u2019s population largely infertile, evangelical extremists took over the U.S. government and stripped women of all rights? What if Richard Nixon was secretly a powerful wizard locked in a decades-long magical arms race with America\u2019s foreign adversaries?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach of these premises invite us to envision worlds so drastically different than our own that the stories being told, be they as books, televisions, or movies ultimately help us see things that our imaginations do not and can not immediately conjure on their own.\n\nThe story that Confederate is attempting to tell, by comparison, doesn\u2019t require a leap of the imagination so much as it requires you to simply look at the reality of being black in America.\n\nConfederate co-executive producer Nichelle Tramble Spellman has said that the show will spend less time reveling in the traditional imagery that we associate with American slavery in favor of exploring the social-political dynamics of a country reliant on modern-day, state-sanctioned slavery. But in a very real way, we can already see those dynamics at play in the real world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real magic and power of alternate histories and speculative fiction lies in the \u201cWhat if?\u201d\n\nWhat is there to be learned from seeing black people being enslaved, brutalized, and exploited that we can not already glean from our actual historical record? What is there to be learned about being born into a system in which you are at an immediate social disadvantage that we can\u2019t already cull from decades\u2019-worth of statistical analyses of black peoples\u2019 economic lives? Though black people are now free in America, in very profound and devastating ways, we are still dealing with the fallout of enslavement that manifests itself in a variety of forms systemic inequality. These aren\u2019t the trappings of an alt-history prestige drama. They are our realities.\n\nStatements like that often confound people who feel as being 154 years out from the ratification of the 13th Amendment means that black people should have \u201cgotten over\u201d slavery by now. If you find yourself feeling that way, I kindly suggest that you start by reading up on: 1) The lasting impact of Jim Crow laws and their new modern forms; 2) How historic lack of access to real estate markets factors into how it\u2019s nearly impossible for black families to accumulate wealth in the U.S. State-backed slavery may be dead, but its ghost still haunts us, infinitely more difficult to encapsulate than its former self but still operant and dangerous as ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so we come back to the question of what exactly there is to be gained from a show like Confederate. There have been many other depictions of slavery both fictionalized (Roots) and largely based on historical fact (12 Years a Slave) that remind us what kind of atrocities were carried out and justified by those who profited from slavery. There are countless instances of science fiction like Octavia Butler\u2019s Kindred and John Ridley\u2019s The American Way being used to unpack how systems of racial inequality that originated from slavery has gone on to shape our country long after the institution itself was ended.\n\nIn Kindred, a black woman named Dana is repeatedly and uncontrollably transported back through time from the late 1970s to 1815 to the southern plantation where her enslaved great-great-great-grandmother is owned and terrorized by Dana\u2019s great-great-great-grandfather, a white slavemaster named Rufus. Dana\u2019s trips into the past are triggered by Rufus\u2019 life being imperiled and, throughout the book, she grapples with hell of having to save her ancestor, an avowed racist and monster, being trapped into slavery herself, and being flung back into her own time where no one can understand what she\u2019s going through. Kindred is, in a very straightforward way, a rumination on the multigenerational trauma caused by slavery that is inexorably interwoven into the histories of all African-American people.\n\nThe American Way explores similar ideas in a different way with a story about a government-sponsored superteam that is split in two along ideological lines when it is forced to accept its first black member during the early days of the Civil Rights Movement. The New American, a black analogue to the original Captain America, literally fights a a villain named the Southern Cross, a racist riff on Johnny Storm whose wears the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s symbol as his official insignia. The America Way\u2019s characters are essentially anthropomorphizations of the 20th century\u2019s racial tensions living through American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that Confederate has left to offer is a depiction of modern-day slavery in which black death and suffering are turned into a fantasy spectacle that justifies the show\u2019s existence, but does little else. For all of its creators\u2019 assurances that Confederate will take the necessary care to be a story worth telling, it\u2019s difficult to see the show being much more than explicitly racialized torture porn masquerading as some sort of poignant commentary about American race relations.\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t need fantasies about 21st-century slavery to see what the world would be like if there were still powerful organizations that profit from the labor of disenfranchised black people living in inhumane conditions. They\u2019re already part of the world that we live in.", "keywords": ["reality", "american", "war", "histories", "black", "way", "legacy", "hbos", "fantasy", "ways", "althistory", "world", "confederate", "real", "slavery", "isnt", "problem"], "polarity": 0.043135782805594096, "subjectivity": 0.4045778767005179},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1.

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That. Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts? Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

The show will be honest, emotional and sometimes cringeworthy, but it will always champion true black love stories.\n\nSo who\u2019s going to be on it?

Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

And, of course, she looks amazing while doing it. I personally love seeing her back in her trademark tailored suits\u2014this time, in several colors, with coordinating kufis. I\u2019m also betting we\u2019ll be seeing more ring-divided braids this spring and summer.\n\nBut most striking is how Mon\u00e1e skillfully reminds us from whence we came, and that the future is indeed black and female. As she says, \u201cHit the mute button, let the vagina have a monologue.\u201d\n\nBut while \u201cDjango Jane\u201d is a banger, Mon\u00e1e still knows how to serve up a bop, and \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d definitely delivers. Co-starring fellow #Fave Tessa Thompson (in a surprisingly sexy mullet), this Prince-inspired track and video (with an opening scene reminiscent of Purple Rain) is a clear nod to those who have been so curious about Mon\u00e1e\u2019s sexuality. The answer? Presumably, whoever makes her feel good. So what?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a #ThrowbackThursday-worthy \u201980s homage from beginning to end, Mon\u00e1e\u2014in dual roles as a brunette and platinum blonde\u2014puts the \u201csex\u201d in sexy, and gives us Madonna-level fashion moments in sheer embroidered pants, head-to-toe rhinestones, leotards that are making this writer run for the gym, and a black-and-white ensemble that reminds us that when it comes to sexuality, maybe everything needn\u2019t be so ... black and white.\n\nIn Mon\u00e1e\u2019s own words:\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m powerful with a little bit of tender\n\nAn emotional, sexual bender\n\nMess me up, yeah, but no one does it better\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better\n\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e via YouTube\n\nTruly, just when we were coming off the afterglow of seeing Black Panther, Mon\u00e1e just brought us to a new high.

Just the other day, I asked her to wrap a bandage for me and she just gave the thing a lick and a promise. Ended up doin\u2019 the goddamn thing myself.\u201d\n\nJonah let his eyes wander about the room as Obadiah continued to complain. The two of them were at Obadiah\u2019s favorite place on God\u2019s green earth: the Red Parlor. Texas\u2019 finest. If it wasn\u2019t frowned upon, Obadiah would probably sleep there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonah smiled as a piano sprang to life. From the never-ending game of poker happening in the corner to the obscenely loud drinking game unfolding at the bar, it was a lively place.\n\nUnless you were Obadiah, of course, whose idea of fun happened to include reaching the bottom of a glass.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed do with her?\u201d Obadiah\u2019s voice snapped Jonah out of his brief reflection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nurse, Jonah. The nurse. Whaddaya think I\u2019ve been yammering about this entire time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That. Uh \u2026 why don\u2019t cha let her go if she\u2019s that much of a yella belly?\u201d He took another drag of his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhere am I supposed to find someone in these parts? Don\u2019t nobody want to do what I do. See what I see,\u201d Obadiah whined.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just talking crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe. I mean, it\u2019s different out here. Out West. And you\u2019re as East as they get,\u201d Jonah grinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re just a stupid shopkeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this shopkeeper is making money \u2026 probably even more than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut your big bazoo, Jonah!\u201d Obadiah slammed his hands on the table and stood up. About a table away, at the bar, Ezra, the bartender, looked up from the glass cup he was cleaning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, good. He\u2019s off on another bender,\u201d Ezra exhaled as Caleb, the saloon owner, passed him by. \u201cShould I kick him out?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe makes us enough money. Let him stick around for a while. If he gets rowdy, I may consider it,\u201d Caleb replied.\n\nEzra went back to cleaning his glass.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re causing a ruckus, Obadiah. You need to calm down.\u201d Jonah put out his cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calm. I\u2019m calm.\u201d Obadiah slinked back into his chair.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Jonah got up. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\n\nJonah made his way toward the bar. When he got there, Ezra glared at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving your friend another drink. He\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t here for that. I\u2019m just here for a nice, tall glass of water.\u201d Jonah grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Ezra eyed him warily, but obliged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doors to the saloon suddenly squeaked open. A fairly tall patron emerged from behind them. Such height alone was enough to attract attention, but being shrouded in mostly black\u2014a black hat, a black coat, some black boots, and a red bandana\u2014certainly helped in that regard too. The poker game came to a momentary stop as the group cast the towering patron a passing glance. A couple of patrons looked up from their drinks out of morbid curiosity and cast the stranger a brief glance. Having passed out on his table, Obadiah was oblivious to the stranger\u2019s entry.\n\nThe stranger began to approach the bar. Jonah grabbed the glass of water, tipped his hat toward Ezra, and started to walk away. He nearly smacked into the stranger. A few droplets of water splashed onto the stranger\u2019s black coat, who in turn did not hesitate to brush them off.\n\n\u201cAh geez,\u201d Jonah snapped. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, goddammit!\u201d\n\nThe stranger moved around him.\n\n\u201cGoddamn carpetbagger,\u201d Jonah said as he sat in front of Obadiah and slammed the glass on the table. \u201cGet up, you lousy drunk.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up, I\u2019m up!\u201d Obadiah sprang up in his seat.\n\n\u201cGood. Drink this.\u201d He slid the water across the table.\n\nOver Jonah\u2019s shoulder, the stranger finally took a seat at the bar.\n\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Jonah asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Obadiah held the glass against his forehead. \u201cI reckon I should be eating crow right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to you being \u2026 you.\u201d Jonah shrugged. \u201cBesides, we got bigger things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh? What are you going on about now?\u201d\n\nEzra approached the stranger, saying, with a smile, \u201cWhat can I do ya for?\u201d The stranger held up two gloved fingers in reply, causing the bartender to raise an eyebrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m assuming ya wanna shot of \u2026 scotch?\u201d\n\nThe stranger remained motionless.\n\n\u201cWhat about bourbon, then?\u201d\n\nThe stranger nodded.\n\n\u201cAll righty then. Be with ya in a second,\u201d Ezra said as he walked away.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d Jonah continued.\n\n\u201cHeard what? Out with it, Jonah. You\u2019re giving me an awful headache.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Payson Gang was in town not too long ago. I thought you knew, having to treat all their dead and all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stranger sat up straighter.\n\n\u201cFor the last time,\u201d Obadiah raised his voice, \u201cI can\u2019t treat nobody if they\u2019re already\u2014\u201d\n\nWithin seconds, the stranger leaped from the bar stool and slammed Jonah\u2019s face into the table. A shocked Obadiah fell into a large patron behind him, who grabbed him by his shoulders and punched him in the face. Still drunk and irate, Obadiah promptly proceeded to head-butt the angry patron, and the saloon erupted into chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTables were flipped. Bar stools were thrown. Glass cups and bottles ended up in pieces on the ground or embedded in the head of a patron. Ezra had abandoned preparing the stranger\u2019s shot of bourbon and ducked behind the bar for cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonah found himself trapped under the stranger\u2019s arm. He squirmed under it while another patron approached the stranger with a bar stool in his hands, ready to strike. The stranger spun around just in time and pointed a revolver in his face.\n\n\u201cI suggest you walk away.\u201d The stranger yanked the bandana down, revealing the face of a dark-skinned black woman. Having heard the clicking of a gun, Ezra peeked over the bar. What he saw immediately caused his eyes to widen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s\u2014\u201d he started.\n\n\u201c\u2014Bloody Mae,\u201d Obadiah gasped from where he was on the ground.\n\nMae turned her attention back to Jonah, pressing her gun against his right temple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTell me what you know about the Payson Gang.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTen Years Earlier\n\nThe year was 1866. My daddy had been hell-bent on joining the throng of folks that were pickin\u2019 up the whole of their lives and hauling them out West. I reckon that part of that zeal was due to a recent change\u2014a \u201cwelcome\u201d change is what my daddy had called it\u2014to the good ol\u2019 US of A\u2019s Homestead Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the very first time in the history of forever, us freedmen and women were suddenly able to own a piece of our own land. That\u2019s rich, considerin\u2019 that we had just got done with bein\u2019 owned ourselves.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop my daddy from being over the moon about it. My mama and me didn\u2019t share his zeal, though, especially \u2019cause we wasn\u2019t keen on traveling so far. Sure, life back in the South wasn\u2019t great, but as my mama always said, the devil you know is better than the devil you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDaddy, it\u2019s hot,\u201d I whined. I looked up at the sun and shielded my eyes from it. It was hotter than a goat\u2019s ass in a pepper patch. I placed my hand on my head to make sure I wasn\u2019t roasting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAy! Ya yammerin\u2019 ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 nobody,\u201d my mama said. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re makin\u2019 it hotter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come now, you two. We\u2019re ain\u2019t but 10 miles out,\u201d my daddy said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elijah. Looks like lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae\u2019s gotta point,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were travelin\u2019 with two other families on horseback\u2014one black, one white\u2014and apparently, we had been \u201clucky\u201d enough to have the 10th Calvary escortin\u2019 us there. My daddy had naturally jumped at the opportunity, seein\u2019 as he and my uncle Hezekiah had fought together during the war and that my uncle Hezekiah himself was leadin\u2019 the calvary.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just tired,\u201d my daddy replied.\n\n\u201cWe can take a rest. I think we\u2019ve earned it,\u201d said my uncle Hezekiah.\n\n\u201cNah. We\u2019re too close.\u201d He turned to my mama, leaning over to plant a kiss on her cheek. I scrunched up my little face at the sickly sweet display. My daddy made a face at me in reply. \u201cEliza, give my baby girl some water. That oughta cool her down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mama nodded and reached for the canteen at the side of our horse. She held it out to me.\n\n\u201cYou better finish everything I pour for you, OK?\u201d She poked my cheeks.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. I damn near inhaled all the water.\n\n\u201cSo, you never told me how the fam was doin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d My daddy kept talkin\u2019. \u201cHow\u2019ve they been?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, you mean Hattie and lil\u2019 ol\u2019 Mary Louise? They\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018They\u2019s fine\u2019? Really?\u201d My daddy was disbelieving. \u201cMary Louise don\u2019t miss you? Hattie don\u2019t mind you bein\u2019 out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019s fine, all right? I mean, they\u2019ve got each other. That oughta be enough, right?\u201d my uncle Hezekiah spat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t the point though.\u201d\n\nMy daddy and my uncle Hezekiah went back and forth. I fixed my gaze on them as I sucked the canteen dry.\n\n\u201cAww. Look at that precious little Negro, Jeremiah. Oh, bless her heart. I could just eat her up.\u201d The white woman cooed to her aloof husband while staring dead at me. It didn\u2019t take much more than that for my mama to look up at her real funny like and for the other black family with us to stare at her like she had just fell off her wagon. My daddy and my uncle Hezekiah stopped bickerin\u2019 and just gawked at the white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c\u2019Scuse me?\u201d my mama said as my daddy pulled on the collar of his shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, dear. How rude of me. I was just admiring that black ball of cuteness. May I?\u201d the white woman said as she reached out to touch my hair.\n\nMy mama was not having it. She slapped the woman\u2019s hand and held me closer to her side. The white woman retreated back to her husband, who then angrily stared at my mama and looked like he was fixin\u2019 to protest. My mama cut him off before he could start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, you done lost your damned mind,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWe ain\u2019t in no stable. You can\u2019t be touching up on my child like she\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cEliza, it\u2019s all right. They didn\u2019t mean nothin\u2019 by it.\u201d My daddy tried to calm her down. She ignored him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this shit. It ain\u2019t been but about four years and ya\u2019ll are still treating us like property. If you lay your greasy finger on my child, I swear before God I\u2019mma make you eat it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you lay a finger on my wife,\u201d the white woman\u2019s husband said.\n\n\u201cAnd who in Sam Hill is gonna stop me?\u201d My mama raised her voice.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah circled around and put himself between my mom and the white family. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. We done come too far to let the heat get to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the heat; I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d My mama rolled my eyes. My daddy looked at her then, and she let out a sigh. \u201cHow much longer before we get there, Elijah?\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and buried myself in my mama\u2019s side. I was all dragged out and the weather was certainly startin\u2019 to get the better of me. So much so that I started to hear the sound of galloping in the distance.\n\n\u201cI reckon we still got about 8 miles to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gon\u2019 get us killed,\u201d my mama replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI told ya,\u201d I yawned, tryin\u2019 to stay awake. But it didn\u2019t seem like it was of any use and I was pretty sure that the gallopin\u2019 had gotten louder. Maybe I was the one who was off her rocker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want no lip from you, Ms. Ruby-Mae.\u201d My mama looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ve already had enough with these white people tryin\u2019 to touch on us, I don\u2019t need anything else to go wrong. In fact, what I need is\u2014\u201d\n\nShots rang out.\n\nBy the time my mama and daddy had turned around to see what had happened, the white woman had already fallen off her horse, with a bullet hole goin\u2019 straight through her pretty little head. I turned just in time to see some blood splatter across her husband\u2019s face and my uncle Hezekiah\u2019s face. My mama put her hands over her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbilene!\u201d her husband cried as he reached for her. Two other calvary members held him back and prevented him from throwing himself after her.\n\n\u201cYeehaw! Get \u2019em, boys!\u201d someone yelled out. We turned and caught wind of a large group of white folk followin\u2019 us on horseback, guns in hand. They didn\u2019t look too happy to see us.\n\n\u201cAw, shit.\u201d My uncle Hezekiah commanded his horse to move faster.\n\n\u201cZeke, what the hell is going on?\u201d my daddy asked. \u201cWho the hell are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem is ex-rebels, Elijah. And not just any rebels, either. Them is the Payson Gang,\u201d he said frantically. My daddy looked at him like he was crazy. \u201cSurround the rest,\u201d my uncle Hezekiah yelled at the rest of his squadron.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaddy, what\u2019s happenin\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy are they chasin\u2019 us?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to take Ruby and go,\u201d my daddy said, paying me no mind as he placed a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou must be out yo\u2019 goddamned mind if you think that I\u2019m leavin\u2019 without you,\u201d she replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, please. I ain\u2019t got much in this world besides you and lil\u2019 Ruby-Mae. I need you to leave without me.\u201d My daddy took a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to my mama. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll catch up with you later. Go.\u201d\n\nMy daddy placed both of his hands on her face and then he kissed her. He then used one of his hands to smooth out the tiny braids on top of my head. He always did that when he was being real serious.\n\nAfter that, with tears in her eyes, my mama held on tight to that crumpled piece of paper and yanked down on the reins of her horse. My daddy grabbed the shotgun strapped to the side of his horse and started to steer his horse in the opposite direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYah! Yah!\u201d my mama cried as our horse jerked forward. I wrapped my arms around her waist so that I wouldn\u2019t go flyin\u2019 off. I turned to get a good look at my daddy when I noticed one of the angry white folks pointin\u2019 their gun at my mama and me. Before I could say anything, my daddy shot him clear off his horse. I looked over at my daddy, and he smiled at me before galloping away.\n\nUntil now, I had been swallowin\u2019 back some salty tears, making sure to not call attention to me and my mama. My mama even sounded like she was chokin\u2019 back sobs. I was tryin\u2019 not to turn around, since my daddy wouldn\u2019t want me to, but I found the feelin\u2019 hard to resist.\n\nI saw my uncle Hezekiah and my daddy fighting against the angry white folk in the distance. I smiled at the show they were putting on. And I was content \u2026 until my daddy decided to turn around too. I could see him looking at my mama and me, wanting to go with us too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the angry white folk didn\u2019t care what he did or didn\u2019t want to do.\n\nThey just wanted to kill him.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did.\n\nShot him through the chest, right off his horse.\n\nI saw the whole thing. I tried to speak up, say something\u2014anything\u2014when I saw one of the white men sneak up behind my daddy. But my voice had caught in my throat and I watched my daddy\u2019s blood paint the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white man that done it looked back in the direction that my daddy had been lookin\u2019 in and saw me watchin\u2019. He smiled a crooked, yellow smile at me then, teeth missin\u2019 and everythin\u2019.\n\nI told myself that I was gonna remember that ugly face. That blond hair. Them triflin\u2019 blue eyes.\n\nAnd one day, I was gonna hunt him down.\n\nI never told my mama what I saw. For a while, she lived in ignorance, hopeful that my daddy was gonna show up any day now on the land that had been carved out for us.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week had passed by since we had last seen\u2019t him. In that week, my mama and I had managed to build a rickety ol\u2019 sod house, and we had started to plant on the land. That shit was hellish and my mama\u2019s horse sure didn\u2019t make it easier.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d I yelled at my mama\u2019s horse as I pushed on the steel plow that was strapped to her backside. Like me, Rita wasn\u2019t keen on sweating in the searing sun. But she and I didn\u2019t have much of a choice, seeing as we were broke and hungry.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waitin\u2019 on? Why ain\u2019t you two moving? This field ain\u2019t gonna plow itself, you know!\u201d my mama yelled from the doorway of our house, fanning herself and launching into a coughing fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, mama. It\u2019s Rita!\u201d I yelled back. \u201cShe ain\u2019t tryna move. I think she\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all hot. What makes the horse special?\u201d my mama complained. I fought the urge to roll my eyes at her reply and went back to plowing. I shook the plow when I felt like Rita was moving too slow.\n\n\u201cCome on, Rita. Please move your ass,\u201d I begged her. She let out a feeble little neigh before she finally moved a hoof. While she was doing that, I looked up and over at my mama for some sort of approval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, I saw two black men in dark blue uniforms approaching her. At first, it looked like one of them might be my uncle Hezekiah, but when my mama didn\u2019t seem to recognize either of them, I forgot about that.\n\n\u201cRita, stop.\u201d I let go of the handles of the steel plow and turned my attention to my mama and the two men. I took a few steps closer. But as I did so, it became clearer and clearer that I didn\u2019t wanna know what they were saying.\n\nI had seen\u2019t what had happened. I didn\u2019t need to hear it again.\n\nOne of the black men took off his hat as they spoke to my mama. She looked at the both of them and then shook her head vigorously, yet another coughing fit accompanyin\u2019 that motion. The other black man put his hand on her shoulder and then motioned to the two horses that they had rode in on. One of the horses had a large something strapped to it, covered by a dirtied white blanket. My mama stared at it for the longest time ... till she simply fainted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe buried him that night. Well, cremated was more like it. My mama had wanted more of a proper burial, but we didn\u2019t have the money for it, and it wouldn\u2019t have been in keeping with my daddy\u2019s wishes neither.\n\n\u201cThe Negro has damn near spent the last 200 and somethin\u2019 years eating gravel in these \u2018United States.\u2019 Why the hell would I wanna do that when I\u2019m dead and gone? When I\u2019m free from all the bullshit? No, burn my ass and let my ashes slide,\u201d he had said.\n\nI watched my daddy burn until there was nothing left.\n\nWeeks passed. And then months. If my mama missed my daddy as much as I did, she never said it. I don\u2019t think that it needed to be said. Oftentimes I heard her during the night. I would hear her weepin\u2019 when she thought I was sleepin\u2019. I would always want to say somethin\u2019, but I never knew what. And so I slept.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy uncle Hezekiah came to visit once. In the fourth month. He brought my auntie Hattie and my cousin, Mary Louise, with him. Said he came to check on us, but he stood outside the whole time he was here. I didn\u2019t hold it against him though. He and my daddy were close. Real close. And if I had learned anythin\u2019 from watchin\u2019 my mama, it was that everybody got their own way of grievin\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to \u2019scuse my husband. He can be quite the mean ol\u2019 cuss.\u201d My auntie Hattie handed over a bundle of food. She and Mama were talkin\u2019 near the door, probably thinkin\u2019 I couldn\u2019t hear them.\n\nMary Louise was tuggin\u2019 on Auntie Hattie\u2019s skirt, tryin\u2019 to get her attention. Auntie Hattie shooed her away. She ended up standin\u2019 off to the side, with her thumb in her mouth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2019ight. I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d My mama grabbed the bundle into her arms, launchin\u2019 into a coughin\u2019 fit. \u201cMe and Ruby miss him too.\u201d\n\nAunt Hattie looked at me then. She gave me a lil\u2019 wave and a grin. I got real nervous and stared right down at the dirt, fixin\u2019 the whole of my attention on it. I reached for a nearby stick and started drawin\u2019 in it.\n\n\u201cIs that what he looked like?\u201d\n\nMy head snapped up quicker than a jackrabbit on moonshine. I found Mary Louise staring at me all funny like. Her thumb was still in her mouth and I looked at her for a hot minute. Her hair wasn\u2019t braided down like my mama did mine and just kind of sat down on her head in a big, fuzzy, dark brown puff. She wasn\u2019t as dark as me neither. She wasn\u2019t high yella though and she reminded me of the color of redwood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYa daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore or less.\u201d I looked down at my drawin\u2019.\n\n\u201cHis head shaped funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYa head shaped funny.\u201d I looked back at her, squintin\u2019 my eyes real scary like.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Ya right.\u201d She smiled a crooked smile. I couldn\u2019t see most of her teeth because of her thumb, but from what I did see, it looked like she was missin\u2019 a few. She didn\u2019t pay my squintin\u2019 eyes no mind though, \u2019cause she sat her lil\u2019 ass right down next to me. She finally took her thumb out of her mouth and dragged it through the dirt like I was doin\u2019. We didn\u2019t say nary a thing to each other until my mama started coughin\u2019 again. We both looked up at her. Auntie Hattie put a hand on my mama\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEliza, when did that start?\u201d she asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that, girl. It\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d my mama said.\n\n\u201cNow, you know that\u2019s a damn lie. That cough sounds wet. You need to do somethin\u2019 about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s nothin\u2019!\u201d my mama snapped. Auntie Hattie dropped her hand then, lookin\u2019 my mama up and down real funny like.\n\n\u201cFine. Forget I said anythin\u2019.\u201d\n\nMary Louise looked back down at the dirt and continued drawin\u2019. I kept lookin\u2019 at my mama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCastor oil oughta do it,\u201d Mary Louise whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I looked over at her.\n\n\u201cI said castor oil oughta fix her right up.\u201d She looked up at me for a bit before lookin\u2019 back at the dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey left that night. I wondered where they had went, but my mama never answered the question straight when I asked it. I decided to leave it alone.\n\nSo, it went back to just bein\u2019 me and my mama again. I didn\u2019t mind it. I liked it that way \u2026 even if it was hard. Despite the hardships, though, my mama thought it wise to press on. By the time summer had left us, we had already finished plowin\u2019 the land and were already startin\u2019 to reap its benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s when our first winter hit us. Then it all went to hell.\n\nAll the crops died and me and my mama were forced into that low-down, shoddy sod house of ours. Livin\u2019 in it during the summer had been bearable, but the winter turned out to be another beast entirely. My mama had thought we did a bang-up job building the damned thing, but that turned out to be a lie when the rain and snow came bearin\u2019 down on it. Oftentimes, we\u2019d end up goin\u2019 to sleep on cold, wet dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did my best to patch it all up while my mama stayed up day and night, tryin\u2019 to figure out what we were gonna do about all our dead crops. My mama had already been fightin\u2019 off a coughing fit during the summer, but it only got worse as the winter came. I tried everything to soothe it. Castor oil. Peppermint. But nothing worked. And it wasn\u2019t long before it took its toll and my mama was reduced to shiverin\u2019 in the corner.\n\n\u201cRuby-Mae, come here,\u201d my mama called out to me. I walked over to her from where I was standin\u2019 in the doorway. I readjusted her blanket, hopin\u2019 that it would keep her warm. She motioned for me to sit down and she held my hand in hers. I fixed my eyes on them. They had gotten frailer and quite small. Her skin had gotten so ashen it looked like charcoal. \u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI was snatched from my thoughts as I looked at my mama\u2019s sunken face. It didn\u2019t look much different from her hands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look so much like yo\u2019 daddy. It\u2019s amazin\u2019.\u201d She smiled at me, twirling one of my braids. It was a smile that was short-lived, because she was sobbin\u2019 soon after that. We sat in the silence of our rickety sod house for a long time. \u201c \u2026 I am so sorry,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI wanted better for us. I wanted so much better.\u201d\n\nI wrapped my tiny arms around her, and she sobbed into my shoulder until she was all but out of tears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, Lord. You shouldn\u2019t be seein\u2019 me like this. All old and frail and what not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, mama. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d I tried to make her feel better.\n\n\u201c \u2026 I\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 for you.\u201d She wiped at her eyes with the back of her tattered sleeves and lifted her head. She then reached under her blanket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. I recognized it as the same piece of paper my daddy had handed to her so long ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got left.\u201d She placed the paper into my hands. \u201cI want you to have it, but you gotta promise me that you\u2019re gonna keep it safe, all right?\u201d\n\nI took the paper into my tiny hands and held it tight.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I nodded. She put her hand on my head and smoothed out my braids.\n\n\u201cYour uncle Hezekiah don\u2019t live but about 5 miles from here.\u201d She spoke softly. \u201cIf anything happens to me, I want you to take that paper, take Rita, and go and find him. He should be able to take care of you.\u201d I nodded again as she placed a kiss on my forehead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI knocked on the wooden door before me like the devil had just lit a fire under my tiny ass. The snow had went and gotten worse. It was also real cold now, and if I didn\u2019t find some shelter soon, I was sure that I was gonna keel over and die. I briefly looked over at Rita and prayed that she would forgive me for dragging her into the cold.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d A voice nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked back to see a tall, black woman staring back at me all curious like, creases showing around her eyes. Her coarse, dark hair was tied back in a tight bun. I squinted my eyes through the stingin\u2019 snow and finally recognized the woman as my auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s m-m-me. Ruby-Mae,\u201d I stuttered. \u201cMy mama said I was supposed to find Uncle Hezekiah here.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d She squinted at me and crouched down so we were seeing eye-to-eye. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about? What happened? Somethin\u2019 had to have happen for you to be comin\u2019 all the way over here.\u201d She rattled off a bunch a questions, some of which I didn\u2019t care for. \u201cIs she still fightin\u2019 that nasty-ass cough? I told her she needed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died,\u201d I said. Auntie Hattie stopped ramblin\u2019 and her eyes grew a bit softer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ... I am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Uncle Hezekiah around?\u201d I peeked over her broad shoulders and into her house. My eyes were immediately drawn to the warm fire inside.\n\n\u201cHe went into town to get us some food. You can come inside and warm up though. I\u2019ll take your pretty horse here to the stable.\u201d My auntie Hattie took the reins from my hand and walked Rita toward the stables. I wrapped my mother\u2019s shawl around me and walked into the house. When I got inside, I immediately put myself in front of the fire and held my hands out to warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRuby?\u201d\n\nI turned to see who was callin\u2019 my name and peeped lil\u2019 Mary Louise on the stairs in her nightgown, with her thumb in her mouth. If my mama hadn\u2019t have just up and died on me, I would\u2019ve laughed at the sight.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let me answer. Instead, she ran at me like she was possessed and nearly knocked my tiny ass over when she threw her arms around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I haven\u2019t seen ya in forever.\u201d\n\nI looked at her real serious like, tryin\u2019 to find the words.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The castor oil didn\u2019t work,\u201d I sighed. She let go of me to get a good look at my face. I didn\u2019t say much else, but that didn\u2019t stop her from makin\u2019 the connection. She sat back down on the floor, starin\u2019 intensely into the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she was doin\u2019 that, I pulled my knees to my chest and I let my eyes wander around the room. I took in all of the pictures of Uncle Hezekiah, Aunt Hattie, and Mary Louise hanging on the walls, as well as all the dead elks, deers, and bears hanging over the fireplace. My eyes ended up resting on a revolver that was sitting on top of the fireplace and under one of the dead elks. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d Mary Louise followed my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d She gulped.\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to shoot it.\u201d Auntie Hattie\u2019s sharp voice drew my and Mary Louise\u2019s attention back to the door. She stood there, crossing her arms. \u201cIf you want.\u201d Mary looked at me real serious like and shook her head vigorously. I glanced at her and then looked back at Auntie Hattie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI nodded.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "eyes", "bloody", "hezekiah", "looked", "jonah", "daddy", "obadiah", "uncle", "mama", "mae", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.06298386792487562, "subjectivity": 0.456466385796743},

The reading club, which he dubbed Books N Bros, strongly emphasizes making reading fun while focusing on and celebrating African-American literature and culture.\n\n\n\n\u201cBooks N Bros is a book club for boys and we read books and African American literature because every time I go to the library at my school, there aren\u2019t many African American literature books there,\u201d Sidney, 11, told St. Louis on the Air. \u201cI already love to read, and since we don\u2019t get that much time to read in school, we just discuss in groups. I wanted to read a book, but I also wanted to discuss it with other people.\u201d\n\nA light really flickered for the precocious preteen when he and his mom, Winnie Caldwell, visited EyeSeeMe, a book store in University City, Mo., focusing on African-American children\u2019s literature. Caldwell shot a video of her son reading in the store that spread across Facebook with some 63,000 views and more than 1,000 shares.\n\n\u201cHe hadn\u2019t seen [a bookstore] like that before and I certainly never had, so he was making himself comfortable on the floor, reading a book,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cWhen you get to a point when he is 11 years old and it was so shocking for him to relate to someone on the cover in a positive aspect rather than it be some negative urban story we see a lot. I would like to make sure he sees himself in being whatever he can be.\u201d\n\nTogether, Sidney and his mom sat down after that fateful visit and a book club immediately jumped to mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe specifically reach out to boys around ages 8 to 10 because that is statistically the age they stop reading\u2014we wanted to combat that,\u201d Caldwell told the radio station.\n\n\u201cMy motivation is I already love to read, but it would be awesome, even better, to read with other people,\u201d Sidney added. \u201cI want to keep doing it because I don\u2019t know what will make me stop reading because I love to read.\u201d\n\nBooks N Bros currently meets once a month and discusses one book that the club has voted on. Their numbers are still small, but the club has grown. Currently, seven to 10 members join in the discussion each month. And while the group welcomes boys of all backgrounds and races, it remains focused on stories with black protagonists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group has even struck up a deal with the Microsoft Store at the Galleria, where the club meets. The boys chat about their books for an hour before each child gets 30 minutes to play video games on a personal console at the store. Serving With the Badge, a group dedicated to helping build police-and-community relationships, donated 200 books to the club so the boys can take books home with them for their own personal libraries.\n\nRead more at St. Louis Public Radio.", "keywords": ["boys", "books", "reading", "focusing", "bros", "literature", "store", "sidney", "childrens", "read", "launches", "boy", "book", "club", "n", "mo", "love"], "polarity": 0.1657092157092157, "subjectivity": 0.4372430872430873},

Kofi knows he\u2019s bae. Kofi also loves black women, fully, unapologetically and relentlessly.\n\nIt\u2019s clear in the way he treats his momager (who happens to be a friend of mine), Koshie Mills. When he speaks to her, his voice is earnest and his gaze is full of attention and intention. I told her that if I could have a son grow up and be like Kofi, I\u2019d seriously consider children. But in real life, I just want to marry her son, or at least a man like him.\n\n\n\nThe way Kofi pays attention and special care to his mother is the same way he looks at black women as a whole. It\u2019s soul-stirring. It\u2019s butterfly-inducing. It\u2019s almost like no one else in the room matters. His attention will give you a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, you could actually be the girl on his arm. How dare he?!\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting Kofi many times, interviewing him often about OWN\u2019s instant classic, Queen Sugar, or the movie Kicks. We\u2019ve spoken on red carpets from New York to Los Angeles, and soon I\u2019ll be in his regal presence again for the summer comedy Girls Trip. Yes, I am a lucky woman.\n\nWhen I see Kofi, I hear Alicia Keys\u2019 \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know My Name\u201d playing in surround sound\u2014from the melodic falsetto part to the breathy, raspy breakdown. It feels like oooooh. He\u2019s got me feeling all crazy inside. If he wanted the hot chocolate from the song, I would make sure to give him milk and cream and not water, just like Alicia did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opportunity not only to chat (repeatedly) with everyone\u2019s man crush Monday through Friday, but also to connect with him, is not missed on me. I stew in the afterglow every single time.\n\nIn my last two interactions with Kofi, one of which was over this past weekend at the American Black Film Festival in Miami, he proved that his sex appeal knows no bounds. Let me explain.\n\n\n\nBeing a sex symbol isn\u2019t as easy as Rihanna, Idris Elba or Morris Chestnut makes it seem. Beyond constantly being sexualized, a sex symbol\u2019s interactions with us mere mortals are often objectifying. I could see that depleting anyone\u2019s energy quickly and maybe even leading him or her to put up a wall. Watching Kofi lean into his sex symbol status has been interesting. He leans into it, as opposed to creating a wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKofi walks into any room and is automatically the center of attention. He revels in it, making his intimidating eye contact with every woman he sees, specifically black women. He seeks us out, looks into our eyes, listens to us gush over his good looks and good heart. He takes countless pictures with us, he hugs us, holds us and without hesitation kisses our cheeks. He admires dreadlocks; full, round rear ends; and legs for days.\n\nHe steps back, takes a look at you, offers you a compliment through those perfectly white teeth and laughs with you as if you\u2019re actually his girl. It\u2019s maddening! But it\u2019s also endearing. I don\u2019t want to open up and unpack the gigantic can of worms that is celebrity men who leave black women in their dust. But knowing Kofi isn\u2019t like that is heart-melting.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMind my reaction in the above Instagram post. Yes, I was melting from the inside out, but I\u2019ve done this song and dance with Kofi before. His ability to make you feel like the only woman in the room is indeed a prize, but eventually, your brain realizes that you can\u2019t actually have Kofi. He\u2019s only a borrowed piece of perfectly chiseled chocolate. This. Is. Frustrating.\n\nI thought I was special, and then I watched him literally connect to every black woman he passed by at the party. With each excited hug, kiss and linger, my heart dropped, knowing that Kofi was just being Kofi\u2014charming, kind and sincere. Sigh. In the back of my mind is a repetitive mantra: Kofi Siriboe cares about black women.\n\nKofi knows he\u2019s bae, and that\u2019s the most dangerous bae of all. I don\u2019t think Kofi has bad intentions when it comes to all of our hearts because I know for sure that he wishes he could love every girl in the world. But Kofi needs to stop selling us (or me) these hopes and dreams wrapped in tight hugs and juicy kisses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrolling never felt so good, though.", "keywords": ["hes", "sex", "trolling", "attention", "everybodys", "black", "woman", "way", "queen", "room", "siriboe", "bae", "women", "kofi", "sugar"], "polarity": 0.10327028044419347, "subjectivity": 0.48236976389150316},

But McKesson\u2019s lawyer asked that the case be thrown out.\n\nFrom The Advocate:\n\nBilly Gibbens, who represents DeRay Mckesson, of Baltimore, argued the suit against Mckesson should be thrown out because it makes only unsupported, speculative allegations. Donna Grodner, one of the officer\u2019s attorneys, acknowledged in court that it is not known who threw a piece of concrete at the officer, causing him to lose teeth and suffer other injuries during the July 9 protest outside Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters at the intersection of Airline Highway and Goodwood Boulevard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported on The Root, the officer, who is identified only as John Doe in the lawsuit, says that he was struck in the face by a \u201crocklike substance\u201d that was thrown at police during the July 9 protest over the death of Sterling, a black man who was shot and killed by two white police officers July 5.\n\nThe suit, which also names Black Lives Matter as a defendant, doesn\u2019t accuse Mckesson of throwing anything at officers, but says he \u201cincited the violence\u201d on behalf of Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe suit says that Mckesson \u201cwas in charge of the protests and he was seen and heard giving orders throughout the day and night of the protests. The protests turned into a riot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe officer, who is seeking unspecified damages in the suit, says that he lost teeth and had injuries to his jaw and brain.\n\nAccording to The Advocate, while Mckesson\u2019s lawyer, Gibbens, said that he was sorry the officer was injured, he said he thought the officer was suing the wrong person.\n\nGrodner, one of the officer\u2019s attorneys, meanwhile, argued that the protest \u201cturned into a riot\u201d because of Mckesson\u2019s actions, and said that protesters \u201cwere begging for the police to come out and confront them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrodner also said that her client should remain anonymous throughout the proceedings for the health and safety of himself and his family, but Gibbens countered, saying that if the officer remained anonymous, \u201cMr. Mckesson will be unfairly viewed as a threat.\u201d\n\nGrodner conceded that there is no immediate or credible threat against her client, and Gibbens said that there is no justification for the officer to anonymously sue Mckesson and Black Lives Matter.\n\nRead more at The Advocate.", "keywords": ["mckesson", "dismiss", "suit", "lawyer", "asks", "thrown", "protests", "judge", "black", "federal", "officer", "lawsuit", "protest", "lives", "officers", "cops", "gibbens", "matter"], "polarity": -0.07375, "subjectivity": 0.5079166666666667},

As a child, she busted her dolls out of their boxes and made clothes and dollhouses filled with her own handmade furniture so that they could fulfill her own unique vision of femininity.\n\nNow in her 10th season at New York Fashion Week with body-positive brand Chromat, McCharen-Tran continues to bust the fashion world out of its Barbie-doll-body box when it comes to casting models.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer FW18 runway show is the very grown-up and sophisticated big-girl version of her childhood obsessions\u2014obsessions that include rich-cobalt-blue swimming pools, Cheetos and a penchant for fitness-friendly tech fabrics. In Chromat\u2019s world, it\u2019s about loving the body you have and flashing your feathers\u2014no matter what size, shape, color or orientation your tail might happen to be\u2014which is why Chromat consistently has the prettiest and happiest flock of birds on and off the runway.\n\nCandy-colored swimsuits in your favorite Starburst-flavor color combos (red and pink, of course), tantalizingly laced together with red cords that resembled licorice ropes, ruled the runway at Chromat\u2019s Friday showing. Cheeto orange was also a dominant color here, in cool multipocket leggings and peekaboo cabana tops and overalls. Swimwear for the conservative Muslim customer was so deftly handled, but it read not as an exception but, rather, as a really cool outfit for any fashion lover to wear and make her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while there was lots of skin on the runway, there was not a whole lot of skinny, a reality that, in a business where we keep begging for diversity, is still mostly ignored in mainstream fashion presentations. Chromat is a business we would all do well to support, not only because the designer is really talented but because, if you want to see a real diversity of images of womanhood represented in fashion, you should vote with your dollar\u2014along with celebrity clients like Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, FKA Twigs, Zendaya, Taylor Swift, Tyra Banks and Nicki Minaj, all of whom are Chromat fans.\n\nDesigner Becca McCharen-Tran and Whoopi Goldberg at Chromat (Getty Images/Andrew Toth) Keke Palmer and Whoopi Goldberg celebrate the power of the \u201cV\u201d at Chromat.

Right now she is the \u201cit\u201d girl of history.\n\n\n\nNo longer relegated to the pages of schoolbooks during Black History Month, the freedom-fighting, self-liberating she-warrior and \u201cconductor\u201d on the Underground Railroad is getting the recognition she so richly deserves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year the Treasury Department announced that Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill (beating out other important female figures like Eleanor Roosevelt and Rosa Parks in a popular vote), and this year alone, tributes to Tubman are popping up everywhere.\n\n\n\nThis weekend marks the opening of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center in Dorchester, Md., her birthplace and the place from which she escaped (March 10 is officially Harriet Tubman Day to honor the anniversary of her death in 1913). The $22 million center will feature exhibits, a research library and workshops where visitors can fully immerse themselves in the life and times of Tubman.\n\n\n\nIn the new season of WGN America\u2019s Underground, actress Aisha Hinds plays Tubman as members of the Macon 7 join her in shepherding fleeing slaves to freedom.\n\n\n\nViola Davis is set to play her in an upcoming HBO biopic, and in February, Broadway star Cynthia Erivo was tapped to portray her in another film.\n\n\n\nA newly discovered photo of Tubman will go up for auction March 30.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Tubman has been showered with attention. During her time, stories of her exploits were widely told in anti-slavery newspapers, where she earned the nickname the \u201cMoses of Her People.\u201d Biographies detailed her legendary feats (sometimes unnecessarily exaggerating them), which elevated her to a larger-than-life, mythical figure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistorian Kate Clifford Larson wrote 2004\u2019s Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of an American Hero\u2014one of the more definitive and well-respected biographies about the famous freedom fighter\u2014largely to dispel many of the myths about Tubman that have been passed down through the generations.\n\n\n\nStill, while reading Larson\u2019s more humanizing and accurate account of Tubman\u2019s life, I coudn\u2019t help being in awe of all the amazing things she did while overcoming the horrors of slavery:\n\n\n\n1. She endured one the worst childhoods imaginable.\n\nThe woman we know as Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross in late February or March 1822 in Dorchester County, Md. She was the fifth of nine children born to Ben Ross and Harriet \u201cRit\u201d Green. She was called \u201cMinty\u201d throughout her early life, but the delicate-sounding handle failed to capture the brutal conditions she suffered as a child. As early as age 6 or 7, she was rented out by her owner, who sent her to other plantations, separating her for long periods of times from her loved ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe worked as a farmhand, checking muskrat traps during winter in freezing waters. She worked as a house servant and was routinely beaten by one of the mistresses who rented her because Harriet didn\u2019t dust a room properly. She bore the welts and scars on her back and neck, but she proudly proclaimed that the beatings never made her \u201chollah,\u201d a display of toughness that would aid her during her freedom-fighting journey. Larson recalls that Tubman was so tough that when she suffered from a \u201cviolent toothache,\u201d she dealt with it by knocking the tooth out with a rock.\n\n\n\n2. She refused to help capture another slave and suffered a traumatic brain injury because of it.\n\nProbably the most well-known story in Tubman\u2019s biography is that she suffered from fainting spells and hallucinations after she was struck in the head by a piece of iron. The story behind her getting struck in the head is pretty heroic: A slave who had left work without permission was being chased by an overseer. The slave ran into a dry goods store, where he encountered a teenage Harriet shopping with a plantation cook. When the overseer found the slave, he ordered Harriet to help him tie down the fugitive, but she refused. When the slave broke free, the exasperated overseer grabbed a 2-pound iron weight and threw it at the fleeing slave but hit Harriet instead.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarriet, who was dazed and bloodied, was taken back to the plantation but received no medical attention; she was back in the field a few days later. For the rest of her life, she would suffer blackouts and, later, seizures. She would also experience vivid dreams and visions, which Tubman attributed to God, whom she felt was guiding her on the road to freedom.\n\n\n\n3. After she escaped from slavery, she went back about 13 more times to free her family and other slaves.\n\nAfter escaping slavery in 1849, Tubman, over the next 11 years, would go back to Maryland to retrieve her brothers and other family members along with other enslaved people. All told, she likely led about 70 to 80 people personally to freedom and helped guide 50 or 60 more by giving them detailed directions when she couldn\u2019t lead them herself. (One of the early biographies about her life exaggerated the number of slaves Tubman freed, putting it in the hundreds.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarson points out that African Americans fleeing slavery from Maryland were not uncommon, given that the state bordered the slavery-free state of Pennsylvania. What made Tubman unique, and ultimately a legend, was that she kept going back, risking capture and re-enslavement\u2014or, worse, death by lynching\u2014to retrieve her loved ones and help others.\n\n\n\n4. She was a queen of disguise and a master of deception.\n\nIn order to return to Maryland time and time again, Tubman would often use disguises, including dressing up like an elderly man or woman. And when disguises didn\u2019t work, Tubman used clever deception. While fleeing with a group of slaves near a bridge in Delaware, Tubman encountered a group of Irish laborers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than run with such a large group, Tubman boldly walked up to the men and started chatting them up \u2026 about Christmas. When they got curious about what she, a lone black woman, was doing on the bridge, she changed the subject to marriage, suggesting that since she had already married a black man, she was now on the lookout for a white husband. Apparently, this discussion about mixing the races through marriage\u2014clearly a taboo topic at the time\u2014was so distracting, the slaves were able to pass the bridge to safety.\n\n\n\n5. When Congress passed a more restrictive Fugitive Slave Act, she redirected the Underground Railroad to Canada.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required lawmen in free, Northern states to aid their Southern brethren in the capture of runaway slaves, making cities like Philadelphia\u2014where Tubman usually settled between trips back to Maryland\u2014unsafe for any former slave to live. Didn\u2019t matter\u2014by 1851, Tubman was ferrying folks to our neighbors to the north.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. She was the first woman to lead an armed assault during the Civil War.\n\nTubman came to the attention of Massachusetts Gov. John Andrew, who thought her stealth and leadership skills would be useful to the Union Army. On June 1, 1863, Tubman led a spy mission to help identify Confederate resources and locate mines that targeted Union boats. The information was used in a raid on a rebel plantation that helped free slaves and helped the Union gain ground. In addition to working as a spy, she also served as a scout, a nurse and a cook. Unfortunately, she would spend the rest of her life fighting for the Union pension she felt she deserved.\n\n\n\n7. She was Rosa Parks before Rosa Parks.\n\nAfter the war, Tubman was on a train headed home to New York from Philadelphia. When a conductor ordered her to the smoking car, she refused. When he tried to physically remove her, he was no match for her strength. When he called two other men to help, she held on for dear life to parts of the train compartment as the men tried to pry her fingers loose. Eventually they twisted her arm and broke it. When she was tossed into the smoking car, she called the conductor a \u201ccopperhead scoundrel\u201d and asked how dare he call her \u201ccolored\u201d\u2014she preferred to be called black or Negro because \u201cshe was as proud of being a black woman as he was of being white.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTubman attempted to sue the railroad company, with little result, but the story of her mistreatment became widely known and inspired African-American suffragist and lecturer Frances Ellen Watkins Harper\u2014who\u2019d suffered similar indignities while traveling by train\u2014to call on the white suffragists to acknowledge that the struggles of black women were on a different level of difficult. Harper said:\n\n\n\nYou white women speak here of rights. I speak of wrongs. Talk of giving women the ballot box? \u2026 While there exists this brutal element in society which tramples upon the feeble and treads down the weak, I tell you that if there is any class of people who need to be lifted out of their airy nothings and selfishness, it is the white women of America.\n\nIn her remaining days, Tubman became a key figure and speaker in the suffragette movement. Until her dying breath, she never stopped fighting for equal rights for blacks and women.", "keywords": ["badass", "suffered", "help", "woman", "life", "black", "women", "tubman", "harriet", "times", "slaves", "slave", "superhero"], "polarity": 0.03196986390345764, "subjectivity": 0.47270841138028624},

Not because her distinct sound of music sounded as if one of God\u2019s angels drank a fifth of gin and figured out a way to plug an extension cord into its harp. It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["queer", "gospel", "sister", "rosetta", "woman", "tharpe", "invented", "black", "music", "roll", "rock", "recorded", "n", "little"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

I yelled it out early this morning when my mother woke me up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI AM NOT GOING TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF!\u201d is exactly how I said it when she came busting into my room demanding that I get my clothes on to go to meet Jesus.\n\nTwo days ago she found me passed out, bleeding, in my closet, and ever since then she is convinced that I\u2019m trying to kill myself. She thinks that she\u2019s going to walk in and find me hanging from the ceiling, my neck stuffed into one of her good bedsheets, so she has taken me to the man she believes can bring me away from the darkness, off the devil music and back to the boy I never was, but the one she wants me to be.\n\n\u201cArthur, either you are outside in the next 10 minutes or I\u2019m sending you to stay with your father.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy father is a zombie who lives in a small apartment in S.E. that isn\u2019t close to anything but drugs and a gas station that sells everything he needs to do drugs. I went to see him when he first got the apartment, right after the divorce, and I stayed up all night looking out the bedroom window onto MLK Ave. That night I watched a woman give a man a blow job behind a school and saw two kids, no older than me, beat an African taxicab driver to his knees for no reason. Once my mother realized that my dad, who had lost his job, only had his apartment because he let the drug dealers sell their drugs out of it\u2014which meant that they paid his rent and he got free drugs\u2014she stopped sending me there. From then on he became a drugged-out Aesop\u2019s fable, a stoned John Henry (if the hammer was a crack pipe) or all starving African children.\n\nDidn\u2019t do your homework! Your father didn\u2019t do his homework and look at him. Rules are there for a reason. Look how your father ended up living without rules. Didn\u2019t clean the dishes! You can go live with your father where that nigga doesn\u2019t even have plates!\n\nNormally I treat her stories like stories, just words without meaning unless I put them there, but this morning, something in her voice tells me she is tired. Maybe it\u2019s the absence of yelling that usually accompanies her threats, or maybe it\u2019s that she said my full name, which always carried trouble and consequence. Either way we both know that whether I was or wasn\u2019t trying to kill myself, sending me to live with the person who isn\u2019t living means that I stop living, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI walk to the car, groggy-eyed, open the door soft, fall into the chilly leather seat and slam the door hard. My mother slaps the back of my head, but I already felt it coming, so it didn\u2019t sting. She makes a left onto North Capitol, a right on Bryant, crosses First, and parks.\n\n\u201cWe could have walked here,\u201d I say.\n\nMy mother scrunches her face, and I notice that she is in full war paint: Eyes, lips and cheeks are all colored. Her light-brown hair is curled tight to her head. I also know that the reason we didn\u2019t walk the three-and-a-half blocks is that I embarrass my mother. My hair is pink. My girlfriend\u2014well, ex-girlfriend\u2014Dolphin dyed it pink right before we broke up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a foot taller than my mother and thin as a whisper. My T-shirt barely comes to my waist; my jeans look painted on, they\u2019re so tight, but I haven\u2019t broken them in yet, which is the only reason I wore them outside; they taper down to my platform black-and-white check Tuks. They\u2019re hard to find, but I got them at an old thrift shop in upper NW. I\u2019d like to think they were Ian MacKaye\u2019s old shoes, ones that he wrecked and ravaged playing night after night in some seedy basement that I was now lucky enough to wear. Of course the soles are coming apart and the once nubby black suede has turned into a washed-out gray, the laces look chewed, and these say that I have been somewhere and seen more than my age.\n\nMy belt is leather, thick, and has stick figure fish skeletons across it in white. My skin is my mother\u2019s\u2014brown like cooked chicken just set on the napkin to rest\u2014but my eyes are wild and my thick, nappy hair says that I am Zombie\u2019s son. I look down at my wrinkled white shirt and feel the shame that being me brings. I get out and shut the door softly.\n\nThe man who is to save me is short, broad and wearing a navy blue suit with thick pinstripes that look like they were drawn with chalk. The shoulders of said suit stick out wider than his shoulders and make his jacket look draped on and too big for his body. His skin and shoes are shiny brown, and his black-and-gray hair is cut tight to his head like a cigarette-ash skullcap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHey, Jesus,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cOh, I am not Jesus, son,\u201d he says. He smiles at my mother and turns back to me. \u201cI\u2019m not a pastor, either. I\u2019m a man of God, though, and your mother\u2019s worried. Consider me like a brother. Lot of folks \u2019round here call me Brother Krall.\u201d\n\nHe holds out his hand for me to shake it and smiles harder this time so my mother can see his teeth. For the most part, the tops of his choppers are whitelike, but his bottoms are dirty snow. He has one top tooth on the right side way near the back of his mouth that is framed in gold. Not a gold tooth\u2014he literally has a thin string of gold lining one of his back teeth. I smack the palm of his hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNice tooth, Jesus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNice church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start. I consider it a spirit house.\u201d\n\nWhere was God when Porch beat the piss out of me until I yelled that I was a faggot? Where was God when Blue took a piss on Mongoose with the mag spokes? Until we clear this up, God and I aren\u2019t really on speaking terms, but I see now why my mother has brought me to this place, and it isn\u2019t so much for my salvation as it is to feed her loneliness. My mother likes Jesus, and I\u2019m her excuse and her explanation. I don\u2019t even have to say anything, as my looks are enough to explain why she needs saving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer Barney-purple knit sweater is too tight and cut too low for the room, which is nothing but old people in the basement of K.C. Lewis Elementary. There are chairs that don\u2019t match. Some are blue, some are red and some look like urine. Jesus is talking to my mom, who keeps laughing and leaning forward, and every time she does, a little more of her hidden skin, skin that is only meant for the bathroom mirror, shows, and Jesus just keeps smiling and there is that tooth, that one way in the back that\u2019s lined in gold that is telling me that his first joke is to get her to laugh and then bend a bit, while the real trick is to peek down the front of her sweater. And my mother, the woman who less than an hour ago was calling me all kinds of ungodly names, keeps touching Jesus\u2019 hand and bending forward, and at this point, her V-neck sweater might as well be a U-neck.\n\nThese two old people flirting makes me want to rinse my eyeballs in bleach, so I stop watching my mother and Jesus and look around the room and see a laminated children\u2019s food pyramid with a cartoon white girl standing holding a half-eaten apple. Old food and juice stain the cement walls that aren\u2019t covered with tiles. There can\u2019t be more than 15 people here, who stand in the back eating doughnuts off a tilted conference table whose tablecloth is about as tight as my mother\u2019s sweater.\n\n\u201cMa, you want a doughnut?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt, don\u2019t interrupt me when I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus knows about patience. Don\u2019t you, Jesus?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says.\n\nI ignore Jesus and walk over to the table and see that all the old people have totally killed the doughnuts. The face of the skinny guy crowding the doughnuts is plain, brown. His skin is smooth and he smells like wet wood. His tan leather jacket was probably cooler when Malcolm X was alive, since the collar is fat like butterfly wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo more glazed, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou kidding? That\u2019s all I come here for.\u201d\n\nHe knows that I know there aren\u2019t any more glaze because I can see he\u2019s holding three stacked doughnuts in a golden glaze tower on a napkin that is wet with sugar. He is eating one, which means, by my count, he has had at least four.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI look at his stack and then up at him, and he shoves the last bit of brown honey goodness into his mouth and starts on his next one. He looks back at me, scrunches his face, and I know that trying to get a doughnut from this old man would be like trying to get my mom to get off my back.\n\nI look over to the table: six plain doughnuts. I grab one, lick it and rub the licked side in the box that once held the glazed.\n\nJesus speaks.\n\n\u201cEveryone, if you want to find a chair, we can go head and get started.\u201d\n\nMy mother waves me off the table, and before I leave, I double-dip back in the glaze and shove the rest in my mouth. I can barely taste anything but thick cake dough. My mother is up front at attention, with her back straight and her chest out, and I wish I didn\u2019t have to be here to see this, her and Jesus all coy and stupid. The old people move like fat cows looking for new grass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sit way in the back and stretch my legs out straight when my mother looks at me and coughs once, strong, which is to tell me to \u201cget up here.\u201d I act like I don\u2019t understand. I point to my throat. Then I mime drinking a cup of water and lay my palm flat as if it is holding a tray, and then mime the drinking-water part again. She curls her top lip and snarls \u201cGet up here\u201d in a language that is an inch above a bark.\n\nJesus is waiting for me. He literally has his hands clasped tight in front of him like a prayer, and I can see he has a pinkie ring with a red stone in it. When I stand, I see that there isn\u2019t a seat for me near my mother, so I snatch a urine-colored seat on my way up and drag the legs against the cold fake-marble floor, and the noise, the steady claw of the metal legs against the ground, is upsetting everyone.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pick that chair up,\u201d my mother says, and I do.\n\nWhen I get to the front, my mother grabs my arm and squeezes, and I can feel her nails digging into my skin. I don\u2019t even care at this point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brother Krall,\u201d she says to Jesus.\n\nHe moves the pinkie-ring hand towards my mother like he\u2019s shooing her apology away.\n\nThen Jesus speaks again.\n\n\u201cFor those of y\u2019all that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m Brother Krall and I\u2019d like to welcome y\u2019all to the Bryant Street Spirit House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOr a fucking lunchroom,\u201d I mumble. My mother squeezes my arm again.\n\n\u201cCome on up here, Diane, as this works better with a partner.\u201d\n\nMy mother lets my arm go. I look down and see that her nails have left little marks in my skin. I rub where her nails once were and I can feel the divots. It doesn\u2019t hurt, but I rub it like it does. My mother ignores me as she stands up smiling like that fat white guy just called her out of the audience to play The Price Is Right. I want to vomit. She turns and puts her purse in her seat and pushes the sleeves up on her titty sweater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is ready for Jesus.\n\n\u201cNow, you stand right there,\u201d he says to her, and places her so that she has her back to him. She stands there giggling and peeking over her shoulder and looking back at the old folks as if she is really worried.\n\nThen Jesus says: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t make cars or know how to fix them, but let\u2019s say that Diane is a car. What kind of car are you, Diane?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fast car,\u201d my mother answers and then laughs and puts her face in her hands like she is embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t really know cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, all cool and stupid. \u201cA fast car works.\u201d\n\nShe is flirting with Jesus, and I can feel little bits of dry dough in the middle of my throat starting to work themselves back up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, today, Diane, your fast car is stuck. The way the Spirit House works is, I\u2019m like a tow truck for God, and if you\u2019re stuck \u2026 \u201d\n\nHe walks towards my mother\u2019s backside, and he puts his hands around my mother\u2019s waist. \u201cI can pull you out,\u201d he says, and drags the word \u201cpull\u201d long and slow like an endless chain while he slowly brings my mother into him. My mother makes this \u201cWhy I never,\u201d old-antebellum-mint-julep face while Jesus stands there with my mother\u2019s butt pressed up against his dick. My mother leans her head back.\n\n\u201cDo you want to get unstuck?!\u201d he yells out from his stomach.\n\nAnd the old people all hopped up on glazed sugar start screaming back.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus!\u201d\n\n\u201cMove me, Lord!\u201d\n\nJesus smiles hard, and I can see that one tooth that is way in the back that is lined in gold, and the old people all hopped up on glazed doughnuts start laughing and yelling, and that thinly lined gold tooth almost winks at me. It almost says I don\u2019t know God; it almost says I\u2019m going to be in your house at ungodly hours in a wifebeater, boxers and dress socks; it almost says Go head and kill yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s embarrassing who now?\u201d I say when my mother gets back to her seat.\n\n\u201cA boy with pink hair can\u2019t tell me nothing about embarrassing anyone,\u201d she says.\n\nI wish I had worn the T-shirt I wanted to wear. It said, \u201cFishbone: Still Stuck in Your Throat,\u201d which highlighted the group\u2019s seminal classic \u201cLet Dem Hoes Fight,\u201d but my mother told me to take it off. So I switched it to a plain white Hanes undershirt in protest of my mother\u2019s ignorance about the best black punk band ever. I tried to explain to my mother that her insistence on sending me out of Stronghold and way off to St. Albans private school is what made me like this. I was never going to like the boys in Stronghold, loud and gangsta, and once I got to St. Albans, I knew I would never wear polo shirts and Sperrys. I was rebellious and confusing, a black kid who found refuge in punks. In hard core, in double bass drums, in power chords; in loud, sweaty concerts where blood and bruises were a badge of honor; in the glory of piercings and tattoos\u2014a visible fuck-you to anyone who didn\u2019t understand; in everything everyone else found disgust in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it was the dual shame I was attracted to, to be black and punk\u2014to be hated and denigrated in either world, to know that those who did understand were the only people for me. I tried to explain to her that punk culture was close to the radical \u201960s and all the shit that she glorified, wearing Afros and Panther buttons. What she wanted was an educated, conscious son who didn\u2019t end his sentences with prepositions; what she got was something way left for her, and at this point I think she would just rather me be gay. At least we could gossip.\n\n\n\nMy breakup with Dolphin led me here, to this lunchroom on this day with my mother, and I am wondering how any of this is supposed to make me better. I had already gone through the three phases of black crisis intervention: The first proved fruitless, since I am almost a foot taller than my mother and have her by at least 80 pounds, so when she threatened to beat the shit out of me, it did nothing.\n\nThe second phase didn\u2019t do anything, since I stopped caring what the family thought of me around the time I got my first pair of Docs and started listening to German punk. To her, shame was still an effective way of crisis management. So when she called everyone and told them that I was losing my grip since the breakup, I was already laying in the bed blasting Fishbone into my headphones and reading Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition out loud. And even with all the noise going, I could still hear my mother\u2014who was walking back and forth in front of my room\u2014saying to a person I believed was my Aunt Beatrice, \u201cThat boy is into that white stuff, and now he\u2019s all cut up over some white girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI kept yelling:\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nThe Slavs and the Irish were among Europe\u2019s first niggers!\n\nPart of her story was true: My breakup with Dolphin was tragic. It came after we\u2019d gone down to the Library of Congress to see a Baldwin retrospective, and I casually mentioned how I thought that being gay and dealing with his sexuality first allowed someone like Baldwin to really free himself into his work. She claimed that somehow I was being insensitive to the plight of the gays. I told her that wasn\u2019t the case. More was said. Mostly her talk-shouting about how could I be such an insensitive asshole. I didn\u2019t get it. She told me we were over. I really didn\u2019t get it. Days later, after hours of research on homosexuality and the Harlem Renaissance to help make my point, she stopped me before I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cArtie. This is so constricted. The whole fallacy of hetero relations and the conformity of the male-female domination is just \u2026 I don\u2019t know ... lame. Like your paying for the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any fucking money!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m saying, Artie; your temper, the structure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomasine. You. can\u2019t. do. this. To. Me. To. Us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Dolphin.\u201d\n\nD-i-a-l-t-o-n-e.\n\nI threw the phone into the kitchen wall and it shattered into pieces.\n\nI got into my dark Levi\u2019s and my Fishbone Give a Monkey a Brain and He\u2019ll Swear He\u2019s the Center of the Universe T-shirt because I felt like if I was going to be the part, I might as well dress the part. I opened a bottle of Jack that I had under my bed and played Fishbone\u2019s \u201cServitude\u201d on repeat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI got drunk faster than I thought I would, and by the fifth time the song came around, Angelo Moore kept yelling at me in his South Central falsetto:\n\nGod\u2019s not with you \u2026 holy roller \u2026 your heart dwells in hell.\n\nI raged. I launched myself into the walls of my room like I was in a mosh pit. I cut my shoulder on the door and the blood soaked through my shirt slow. I don\u2019t remember the cuts on my face or hands, as I was numb. I remember bleeding. I remember bending over to catch my breath, and then I remember the room shifting sideways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI threw myself around my room and shattered into pieces. My mother found me unconscious in the room with blood all over the carpet.\n\nThis is where the legend of my killing myself began.\n\nShe told me she was going to beat the shit out of me if I couldn\u2019t pull it together.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet some white girl run you down like that.\u201d\n\nMy mother was embarrassed when I started dating Dolphin. She thought it was a physical manifestation of my hate for her. None of that was true, but that\u2019s the way she would phrase it to her sisters, or the hen house, as Zombie called them when they got to squawking.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Mom; I just love Dolphin.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dolphin.\u2019 You hear that, Bea? The bitch named after a fish.\u201d\n\nShe was naming herself after a freedom that she thought only came to animals left in the wild. She was trying to reclaim a part of her that felt confined by societal standards. She didn\u2019t like her birth name or even the idea of birth names, as she believed that naming someone was akin to ownership, and I explained all of this to my mom and told her that Thomasine calling herself Dolphin was no different then when blacks started changing to Muslim names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPlease stop comparing that little white girl to what we went through \u2026 \u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help the day my mother pulled up in her tiny gray Nissan Sentra and I was on the porch with Dolphin, who\u2019d just started letting her hair dread. We had already had sex in the house, but we knew to move it to the porch, as my mother didn\u2019t like it when we were home without her supervision, which meant me and Dolphin sitting in the living room while my mother watched TV in the kitchen. So by moving to the porch, we let her believe that we were sexless. My mother, who had just gotten off work, was saying something about getting something out of the back seat of the car when she saw Dolphin\u2019s thick blond dread in the front of her face.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked Dolphin.\n\nAnd Dolphin didn\u2019t get it. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was burning a hole through the top of her thick, dirty-blond hair. She didn\u2019t see that my mom was working over all of the black things stolen by whites. She didn\u2019t see that my mother was seething with a kind of hatred that only comes from realizing that you have been betrayed, because to Dolphin, she hadn\u2019t done anything to my mother. She hadn\u2019t stolen anything, beaten anything, taken anything from her. She sat there looking for something on her Chocolate Genius GodMusic T-shirt that said I was just in your house, in your son\u2019s room, in positions that only gymnast or acrobats should perform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need me to get something out of the car?\u201d I said, shuffling down the walkway towards Adams.\n\nMy mother, carrying her empty green mesh lunch bag from work in one hand and an elbow full of ungraded school papers, just looked down on Dolphin the way a slave owner looked down a slave deciding whether or not he should sell him. I could feel Dolphin looking out at me for safety, some kind of line that would bring her back to shore. But I had nothing for her, no net, no rope and no words to throw overboard.\n\nI looked at my mother in her blue school dress and red belt that came across her waist like the equator and then at Dolphin, so thin and pale in dusty cutoff Dickies and dirty red Chucks with no laces. The two women who would be the closest to my core, both oceans away. I looked down at the top of my red Dr. Martens that weren\u2019t scuffed enough to look believable, my boots that showed no signs of revolution, still carried the out-of-box shininess that showed my face to look just like what I was: sheltered. It was then that I realized that the truth didn\u2019t really live with Dolphin and me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking back on it, this was probably the first root that broke through the pavement because no matter how much I loved pulling and kissing and tugging Dolphin\u2019s flesh, I just couldn\u2019t cross my mother. So Dolphin broke first. She looked away from me and down at her hands and then at her feet and then into the ground and off into a distance where my mother hadn\u2019t come home. And my mother let her off the hook and took her papers, her lunch bag and the last remnants of her Afro, the tiny hairs that she couldn\u2019t curl that rested on the bottom part of her neck, way lower than the de-revolutionized permed and pressed-out part that covered it, and pulled the screen door and walked into the kitchen. I stuck my hands in the front of my jeans and frowned my face the way that only wordlessness can leave jaws tight, and walked back from the car and sat next to Dolphin, who started crying.\n\n\u201cWhy does your mother hate me?\u201d\n\n\u2026 sujeta en mis brazos como un pez infinitamente pegado a mi alma r\u00e1pido y lento en la energia subceleste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is what I should\u2019ve said. I should have pulled on the only quote that I memorized from the Spanish version of Neruda poems that she gave me and that I struggled through that night with her on the phone and she giggled and said \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time.\n\nBut what I said in that moment when she needed me most, in that moment when my mother just walked in and crushed us back to babies, in that moment when I realized just how small we both were\u2014in that moment, all I could muster was, \u201cMy mother doesn\u2019t hate you; she just loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHallelujah!\u201d A fat black woman yells who is too big to praise dance, so she just wiggles and holds her hand above her head, waving Jesus away.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is in full bloom, Jesus. He has a blue washcloth in his hand like dead roses, and every now and again he pats his forehead with it. He lost the jacket about six amens in, and his white shirt is now loose and wrinkled around his waist. When the sun comes in through the square-cut window in the lunchroom door and hits that back tooth that I feel like only I can see, it make his face shine. The slight glow off the thin lining that rounds that tooth like old piecrust is whispering in a language that only I can hear. I feel like it\u2019s asking, \u201cWhy do pastors and pimps dress alike?\u201d I feel like I hear, \u201cI can help you get closer to God.\u201d I turn to my mother to see if she is there with me when I hear, \u201cThese people aren\u2019t your friends.\u201d\n\nMy mother grabs my hand and holds it up to the air, and I snatch it down and ask her what she is doing. I never like when my mother forces my body to do stuff, as I have never been a fan of being pushed around.\n\n\u201cYou better put your hand back up in the air,\u201d she says.\n\nI can tell by the way the ends of her eyebrows are pointing down and inward towards her nose that I need to get it back up, so I do. Turns out, Jesus asked all the people who love God to put a hand in the air. And then he walks over to the doughnut table and snatches one of the empty doughnut baskets off the table so fast that the napkins and powder both fly from the basket and land perfectly on the floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI told you we\u2019re small,\u201d he says as he hands the basket to a woman in the back of the cafeteria. \u201cJust remember when we are way out in one of those big ole churches out in Bowie and all of y\u2019all are elders, we can laugh about how we had to use the doughnut basket for the bread basket! Can I get an amen!\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d\n\nThe doughnut basket makes it past me, and Mom puts in $5 for the both of us. I hear women in the back say that it was a lovely service as they gather their purses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cNext Sunday is couples counseling, so come back here with your boyfriend and girlfriends and I can show you how to get that train back on track.\u201d\n\nThe old men and women laugh, mostly at the idea that any of them have girlfriends or boyfriends, and it dawns on me that in my newfound singledom, I, too, am a part of this joke. My mother looks over at Jesus, giving him the nod, and then tells me that she will be in the car while I talk to him. He stands by the door shaking the hands of the old women leaving, who have a little bit of the gospel in their step now. When the last woman leaves, he shuts the cafeteria door and the sun stops leaking into the small window.\n\n\u201cCome on and let\u2019s talk back here,\u201d he says as he snatches his blazer and the doughnut basket off one of the seats. The room that he takes me to is right off the church, and I can tell from the red kick balls, movable balance beams, jump ropes and tennis rackets that this is gym storage. A desk sits near the back, and Jesus walks over and plops himself down in a wooden chair that doesn\u2019t flinch at his weight, and I grab a chair and put it across from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he says. \u201cPussy or money?\u201d\n\nI am thrown off by the word \u201cpussy\u201d\u2014not that I don\u2019t use it, but it feels strange coming out of Jesus\u2019 mouth, even with the tooth. I tilt my head like a dog that can\u2019t figure out if what his owner is holding is really a bone.\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, man, you heard me; pussy or money?\u201d\n\nThe choice hangs between us, steaming like fresh-cooked pot roast with no knife.\n\nJesus speaks. \u201cThe way I see it, there\u2019re only two reasons a man would kill himself: pussy or not having no money. You too young to know what being broke really feels like, so it must be pussy. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s right, although I haven\u2019t been far-enough removed from Dolphin to reduce her to just a lone body part.\n\nHe leans and pulls the money basket off the table and sticks his fat fingers into the top.\n\n\u201cAlmost forgot,\u201d he says, and then reaches into his blazer pocket and pulls out two gold rings that have diamonds the size of baby teeth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBad luck to count bread without these,\u201d and he holds them up so I can see. The one he slides on his middle finger looks like a class ring, and the other he forces down his index finger looks like something a rapper wouldn\u2019t wear.\n\n\u201cNice rings,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYeah, I got these off a sucker out Seat Pleasant.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if he means that he beat someone up and took their jewelry or he haggled a fool down on the price; either way I don\u2019t ask him to clear it up. Jesus licks his ringless thumb and counts each one of the dollars given him by the old folks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPussy can mess your head up,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d I say, but I don\u2019t know what he means.\n\n\u201cTrust me when I tell you, you wouldn\u2019t be the first nigga to kill himself over a dame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe word \u201cdame\u201d feels like 1950s cop talk, and I try to straighten my face because I am sure that it says that I am lost.\n\n\u201cI knew when you walked in that you were strung out,\u201d Jesus says.\n\nI have him here.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do drugs,\u201d I say, and sit up straight, since this a common misconception that I am forced to take on as a black punk. Everyone thinks I shoot heroin because I am so thin, so I am always proud to boast that I am not Zombie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not my father.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t talking about drugs, man, although some people might call it that,\u201d and Jesus laughs hard at both his joke and my ignorance.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d I say, slouching back in my seat. Slightly defeated.\n\n\u201cBecause no man would dye his hair pink unless some nice pair of legs told him it would look cute. Am I right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesus dumps the coins out of the basket and starts counting. He isn\u2019t looking at me because he knows he\u2019s right. The day we went to get the dye, I wanted something less radical, maybe blond or a soft green, but Dolphin picked out the box of pink with purpose and told me that this was it, and like a heroin addict I was all in.\n\n\u201c$11.34!\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThat barely covers the cost of the doughnuts. I should play that number.\u201d He reaches over and grabs a small slip of paper and a pen, and I assume he writes down 1-1-3-4.\n\n\u201cYou gamble?\u201d I say, which even catches me off guard, considering that he has been talking to me about pussy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d He says. \u201cLife is a gamble and if someone has to win, why not Brother Krall?! You got to walk before you Krall.\u201d And Jesus laughs, and I don\u2019t get any of it.\n\n\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you think those old folks that came to see me today, how you think they feel now?\u201d\n\nThis felt like a trick. Some kind of question that he already asked me in a previous life where I had never met Dolphin or dyed my hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBetter,\u201d I say, knowing that this is the response he wants and the one that feels easiest to give.\n\n\u201cYou damn right. Each one of them paid a dollar to feel better, and you think they got their money\u2019s worth?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou damn right they did.\u201d\n\nHe grabs the doughnut basket. \u201cSee, this here is short money; the real money is down the road when times get tough. I\u2019m with them now so that when everyone else leaves them, they know they still have me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s when you stick it to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jesus says, patting the pocket of his blazer.\n\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d he says, holding a pack of Newport 100s towards me.\n\n\u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\nHe pulls out a long cigarette, lights it and puts his shoes on the desk.\n\n\u201cSo I know how to save them,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cThey\u2019re easy. They\u2019re ready to be saved; in fact, they\u2019re begging for it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe takes a drag. \u201cThe real question is, how do I save you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny, since I didn\u2019t know I was lost.\u201d\n\nJesus blows out smoke.\n\n\u201cWe all are. The question is always, how do we get found? Maybe you find it in your music or whatever, but don\u2019t think for a second that you aren\u2019t looking. That\u2019s why pussy is so important.

So I told my agent over the weekend to pull the project,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nGay doesn\u2019t care if the publisher says that the Yiannopoulos\u2019 book wouldn\u2019t include hate speech (yeah, we\u2019ll see, I guess).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGay stood firm in her choice, saying that she\u2019s not about censorship, but she is also not interested in doing \u201cbusiness with a publisher willing to grant him\u201d the privilege of saying whatever vile words come to his head.\n\nHere\u2019s Gay\u2019s statement regarding the matter to BuzzFeed:\n\nWhen the announcement about Milo\u2019s book first came out, I was relieved because I thought I didn\u2019t have a book with Simon & Schuster and tweeted something to that effect. Then I remembered my TED Book and that TED is an imprint of Simon & Schuster. I was supposed to turn the book in this month and I kept thinking about how egregious it is to give someone like Milo a platform for his blunt, inelegant hate and provocation. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to turn the book in. My editor emailed me last week and I kept staring at that email in my inbox and finally over the weekend I asked my agent to pull the book. Though TED Books and Threshold are vastly different imprints, they both reside within Simon & Schuster and so I guess I\u2019m putting my money where my mouth is. And to be clear, this isn\u2019t about censorship. Milo has every right to say what he wants to say, however distasteful I and many others find it to be. He doesn\u2019t have a right to have a book published by a major publisher but he has, in some bizarre twist of fate, been afforded that privilege. So be it. I\u2019m not interested in doing business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege. I am also fortunate enough to be in a position to make this decision. I recognize that other writers aren\u2019t and understand that completely. The editor of TED Books is Michelle Quint. I don\u2019t think Michelle is an employee of Simon & Schuster. She works for TED. She is, from my experience thus far, smart, kind, patient, and committed to putting good books into the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, How to Be Heard has not yet found another home, but Gay still hopes that the book is published some day.\n\nRead more at BuzzFeed.", "keywords": ["pull", "editor", "simon", "schuster", "pulls", "gay", "deal", "ted", "upcoming", "privilege", "book", "published", "yiannopoulos", "milo", "roxane", "publisher"], "polarity": 0.1738095238095238, "subjectivity": 0.5668154761904762},

She\u2019s gorgeous, highly accomplished, decidedly brown-skinned and likely pissing off a huge swath of Trump voters (woot, woot!). But spoiler alert (among several): If you\u2019re expecting a season full of scenic montages glorifying black love, she\u2019s also likely to disappoint you. Manage your expectations accordingly.\n\nFull disclosure: I\u2019ve never been a follower of the Bachelor or Bachelorette franchises. Despite my deep interest in relationship dynamics, something about the concept of dozens of women shamelessly vying for the attention of one eligible man\u2014who will choose one, after hopelessly romancing as many as possible\u2014never much appealed to me. Frankly, it sounded like an average hetero singleton\u2019s summer in any urban mecca; I didn\u2019t need to watch it on TV to know how it played out. The pandering turn of the tables on The Bachelorette was equally suspect to me (an instinct that was confirmed upon hearing that the 2015 season pitted two potential Bachelorettes against each other, with the decision made by the male contestants\u2014WTF?).\n\nBottom line: If the death of romance was already nigh, I\u2019d be best served getting my own while the getting was good. Plus, everyone already knew the black folks were generally gone by the third ep.\n\nBut ironically, I hail from an immediate family of avid Bachelor/Bachelorette viewers. Upon discovering that my current visit to our Midwestern homestead would include gathering around the 70-inch to catch the premiere, my nose reflexively wrinkled in disdain. \u201cBut she\u2019s black!\u201d rose the outcry (read: Our real-life Disney princess has finally arrived ... and she\u2019s finally getting her prince!). Since two things I can never manage to do while visiting home are eat healthy and say no to family requests, I reluctantly settled in Monday night for what would inevitably be two hours of schmaltzy torture, albeit this time in sepia.\n\nRachel Lindsay, the 13th, and first black, Bachelorette, is understandably an easy sell; polished, credentialed and ultimately \u201csafe\u201d enough to have made it to the finals in last year\u2019s Bachelor, surprisingly cementing her appeal to the masses of (predominantly white) female viewers ages 18-49 who make up a majority of the franchise\u2019s core demographic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConveniently, her casting also satisfies the long-held criticism of the lack of inclusion on both shows. It\u2019s notable that while The Bachelor is the senior of the two, a black Bachelor has yet to be introduced\u2014presumably because of fear of how a black man engaging romantically and sexually with nonblack women would affect the popularity of the franchise.\n\nEven in a season centered on a black woman, black men noticeably made up only about a third (11 out of 31) of the \u201cmost diverse cast\u201d of contestants introduced during this season\u2019s premiere, with perhaps another four to six ethnicities bringing the total number of men of color to approximately half. In fact, six of the nine who went home after the first rose ceremony were of color, leaving only seven black men among the remaining 22 contestants.\n\nBut while the pre-rose-ceremony confidence among the brothers was ridiculously high, our Bachelorette often seemed less than impressed. Ultimately, Rachel\u2019s \u201cfirst impression rose\u201d went to a Colombian-American she admitted to being \u201csmitten\u201d with on sight, who easily fulfilled the \u201cLatin lover\u201d stereotype by being the only contestant who dared to kiss her (deeply) upon first meeting. Meanwhile, a bellowing, gimmick-laden, overgrown frat boy disappointingly garnered the coveted last rose, likely more for the sake of ratings than romance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd how did this resonate with black viewers hoping to see some black-on-black love in prime-time reality TV? A quick perusal of my Facebook feed gave a few clues ... and folks were not amused. Fellow writer Tarana Burke summed it up most succinctly:\n\nHow you not going to give the first impression rose to a BROTHER!?! Come on Rachel. You were supposed to do it for the culture \u2026\n\nBut what can\u2014and should\u2014we really expect from Rachel Lindsay? While clearly an equal-opportunity dater, her ascension to Bachelorette is only due to the fact that she wasn\u2019t chosen by last season\u2019s indisputably white Bachelor Nick Viall. And perhaps this is the ultimate dilemma facing our first black Bachelorette: Being the first\u2014at anything\u2014means the weight of \u201cthe culture\u2019s\u201d expectations rest firmly upon your shoulders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA preview of upcoming episodes show both a woman open about addressing race with her nonblack beaus, as well as a weeping Rachel, lamenting that people will judge her for the decisions she\u2019s making. One can only wonder if the decisions she\u2019s referring to will include any black men as the season progresses.\n\nAs one who holds little faith that this franchise will ever realistically represent black love the way its network counterpart Black\u2019ish does, I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be tuning in to find out. But personally, I have some sympathy for Rachel, and the undeniable scrutiny she\u2019s going to face, no matter whom she chooses ... though just a glance at the comments section of the Fox News recap is enough to make me hope her final rose lands on the heart of a black man:\n\nI think everyone knows she will pick a white guy given the option, if she wants a Man that will stick around after the kids!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause this is the caveat of being \u201cfirst\u201d: the inevitable desire to both satisfy \u201cthe culture\u201d and prove the naysayers wrong. Ultimately, in the search for true, Disney-princess-style love, Rachel\u2019s only real responsibility is to herself (and she\u2019s purportedly already engaged, so apparently dreams do come true). But as my friend Tarana reminds us, there\u2019s a high likelihood that the odds won\u2019t land in our\u2014or the culture\u2019s\u2014favor:\n\n\u201cP.S. Prepare yourself.

We believe she and her son John Henry Shepherd (and maybe others) traveled along the Underground Railroad. A family story indicates that she may have had her \u201cfreedom papers,\u201d but we don\u2019t know for sure. We have no information where she has been enslaved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom stories told, she did travel the Underground Railroad with her young child (sometimes described as babe in arms). They could have entered Canada at Fort Erie or Niagara. We have traveled the Freedom Trail here in Canada and tried to find information. All people we spoke with indicated that we may have to look south to the USA, but we have no idea what to do or where to go or who to talk to.\n\nAccording to the 1861 Canada West census, Mary Ann Shepherd was born circa 1801 and her son John Henry Shepherd was born circa 1851. Their birthplaces are unknown. From 1871 forward to 1948, we can trace John Henry Shepherd because he is listed on Canadian census documents.\n\nWe found, in that 1861 census, that William Bell, a \u201cNegro labourer,\u201d and Mary Ann Bell, a \u201cNegress,\u201d age 61, had married in 1847 and John Shepherd, \u201cNegro,\u201d age 10, was with them. Sometime in the 1860s, Mary Shepherd/Bell died and the farm owner where she worked agreed to raise John Henry until he could support himself. In the 1871 census, John Henry Shepherd is listed with the \u201cMurray\u201d family. The Shepherd family has continued to live within the general area that the 1861 (and after) censuses indicate. John Henry Shepherd married his wife, Sarah (nee Hartley), and raised a family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlease help us learn more about Mary Ann Shepherd before she arrived in Canada. \u2014Craig Brooks\n\nThe best place to start is always to gather as much information as you can about Mary Ann and people she was associated with from the records that you have already to look for clues that could help you identify her in the United States. The story of John Henry Shepherd and Mary Ann has become something of a legend, which means you\u2019ll have to check the folklore surrounding them against documents you can find to determine what is likely to be true and what is not.\n\nThe North Halton Compass newspaper in 1998 described John Henry and his mother as making their way to Canada and settling in Stewarttown, Ontario. She made an agreement with Col. John Murray that he should care for her son if anything were to happen to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoing the Math\n\nAs you noted, the 1861 Canadian census (pdf) shows Mary Ann Bell and her husband, William Bell, and John Shepherd living together.\n\nBased on their ages, it seems possible that Mary Ann (born about 1801) was John Henry Shepherd\u2019s grandmother and not his mother as one account about the family suggests, since she would have been 50 years old at the time of his birth. What is curious is that if the couple were married in 1847, as this census record suggests, and John Henry Shepherd was born about 1851 in the United States, the couple should have been together prior to their venture to Canada, and yet none of the folklore surrounding the family mentions William Bell traveling the Underground Railroad with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t rule out the possibility that they were married in Canada, even if that conflicts with the commonly assumed escape-to-freedom timeline for Mary Ann and young John Henry. Before 1869, vital records recorded in Canada, and more specifically Ontario, are likely to be in church records. There are collections of Catholic Church records, such as the Druin Collection available digitally through Ancestry.com (subscription required) and on microfilm via the New England Historic Genealogical Society, where this column\u2019s co-writer, Meaghan Siekman, works; however, the couple\u2019s reported religion in census records is not Catholic. Based on the date, it is possible their marriage could have been recorded at the district level. There is an index of Ontario Marriages on Family Search; however, when we did a search for William Bell between 1845 and 1849, none of the results appeared to be a match.\n\nEven if you assume they were together in the United States, and informally wed in 1847 (as we have previously noted, slaves could not legally marry), you still could look forward in time to locate more information on William Bell to see if that leads you to more information on Mary Ann and John Henry Shepherd.\n\nBy 1871 John Shepherd was living in the household of John Murray, which aligns with the family lore about the Murray family caring for him after Mary Ann\u2019s death, but it does not tell us what happened to William Bell. He could be the same William Bell who was residing in Camden, Bothwell, Ontario, in 1871 and who was born about 1812 in the United States and was a widower at the time the census was enumerated. He is a close-enough match to what is known about the William Bell in question, and if he is one and the same, he had not ventured too far from the family\u2019s original location in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis William Bell was living among several other families of African descent who were all born in the United States. It is possible that members of these families knew each other in America prior to their arrival in Canada, so further investigation into the other black families may help you pinpoint a location of origin in the United States for Mary Ann.\n\nTracing the Underground Railroad for Clues\n\nThe nature of Mary Ann Shepherd\u2019s entrance into Canada illustrates the increasing lengths that the enslaved went to in order to gain freedom in the final years leading up to the U.S. Civil War\u2014and the lengths enslavers went to in order to thwart them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was part of a group of laws designed as a compromise between free states and territories and slaveholding states. The law required that any runaway or escaped slaves be returned to their slave owner upon capture. One of the more controversial elements of the Compromise of 1850, the act was hated by abolitionists and sent a growing number of escapees through the already-legendary Underground Railroad.\n\n\n\nIt was no longer safe for runaway slaves to settle in Northern American states, and they had to make their way all the way to Canada to ensure that they would not be returned to slavery. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, \u201cWhile an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 freedom seekers entered Canada during the last decades of enslavement in the US, the decade 1850\u00ad\u00ad\u201360 alone saw 15,000 to 20,000 fugitives reach the Province of Canada when it became the main terminus of the Underground Railroad.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the law and the general workings of the Underground Railroad will help you better understand what records might be available to help you trace Mary Ann back to her place of origin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to narrow your search within the United States, you might examine some of the general migration patterns for runaway slaves determined by the fastest path to freedom from where they originated.\n\nSince you know that Mary Ann Shepherd and John Henry Shepherd entered Canada at Fort Erie or Niagara, you can work backward to determine that she likely originated in one of the Southern states on the Eastern Seaboard, but likely not as far south as southern Georgia or Florida, where she would have been more likely to have fled south.\n\nIt is also not probable that she came from interior states such as Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, since she likely would have entered Canada through Ohio, Indiana or Illinois were this the case. While it is still a large area to cover, understanding these patterns narrows your search to Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and possibly Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSearching Runaway-Slave Ads\n\nSince you do not know much about Mary Ann during slavery\u2014who her owner may have been or where she came from\u2014newspapers may be your best option for trying to work backward. Knowing the likelier paths she took to get to Canada, you could work backward and check newspapers in those locations for mention of runaway slaves that match Mary Ann Shepherd\u2019s description. Newspapers included runaway-slave advertisements, particularly if it was believed that the slave made his or her way to that state, and often newspapers covered incidents along the Underground Railroad.\n\nBased on where she ended up, Mary Ann very likely traveled through New York City, Philadelphia and probably Baltimore if she had not taken a ship to one of the other two. (Historian Eric Foner\u2019s book Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad, provides valuable information on the route through New York City.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou could start with newspapers from these three cities. Many newspapers have been digitized and can be searched through subscription-based databases, such as Newspapers.com and Genealogy Bank, or they may be available through local historical societies. Google Newspapers also has several historical newspapers you could search free of charge. Try using search terms such as \u201cMary\u201d and \u201crunaway\u201d or \u201cfugitive\u201d to help limit your results, as well as the surnames \u201cBell\u201d and \u201cShepherd.\u201d\n\nSearching for slave advertisements can be a tedious endeavor depending on the availability of newspapers digitally. Some projects are working to make them more accessible, however. Cornell University is working on an exciting project, Freedom on the Move, which will create a database of runaway-slave ads from all of North America.\n\nUntil that is available, you could also try some more localized projects, such as the North Carolina Runaway Slave Advertisements Project. Runaway-slave ads usually contain a wealth of information, such as the slave owner\u2019s name, a physical description of the runaway and any trades or special skills he or she possessed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, we searched the North Carolina database for the name Mary, and an ad from 1837 offers a $50 reward for the return of Samuel, Judy and their four children, Henry, Burton, Nelson and Mary. In addition to telling you that the escaped belonged to the estate of Sacker Dubberley, it includes the ages and physical descriptions of the individuals and notes that Samuel can read and write. This type of information was included to help would-be captors identify the escaped and to make it harder for them to get employment in their new homes, since revealing a trade\u2014or, in this case, the ability to read and write\u2014could help identify them.\n\nIf you can find a newspaper ad with a description that seems like it could be your Mary Ann and John Shepherd, you will then want to investigate the slave owner to see if any of his or her papers could reveal even more information.\n\nChecking Slave Schedules\n\nYou could also cast a wider net in searching for individuals who match Mary Ann and John Henry\u2019s description in the 1850 United States Slave Schedules. Start by limiting your search to slave owners with the surname Bell or Shepherd in states where she likely originated, with a female slave in the household born about 1801. You could then narrow it further by identifying those households that have someone matching William Bell\u2019s description. This will be a daunting task, and it should be noted that the surnames may not have been inherited from a slave owner at all. But it is one way you could continue to work through documentation for any clues of Mary Ann\u2019s origins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, we suggest contacting the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. Its research staff may have resources and tips for narrowing your search, and the center does have volunteers who work with people on genealogical queries.\n\nGood luck!\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and founding director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University.

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked.

American slavery, as we know, was a heinous, painful institution characterized by terrifying acts of violence. Whether it was the systematic rape of black women, the sale of black children away from their parents, squalid living conditions or enforced hard labor, slavery was designed to break the spirits of black people who built individual and national white wealth, which quickly made young America a global economic superpower.\n\nA central aspect in the oppression of black slaves was the deliberate mission of white slaveowners to keep their slaves in ignorance. With knowledge comes power\u2014the power to think, to communicate and to take one\u2019s freedom back by any means necessary. Thus, it was a serious crime to teach any slave to read or write. And yet black Americans found a way to triumph even in such agonizing conditions.\n\nAlthough largely ignored in the canon of Western literature, free black Americans educated themselves and published novels as early as 1853. States scholar Gregg Hecimovich, \u201cWilliam Wells Brown\u2019s novel Clotel was published in London in 1853, making Brown the first African-American novelist.\u201d Wells, like many early black American novelists, drew from his personal experiences of slavery and racial violence in the United States, attempting to process these horrific experiences and regain selfhood through the act of finding his voice and speaking his truth on the page\n\nNow a new discovery has come to light: the work of black novelist Sarah E. Farro. Farro published her novel, True Love: A Story of English Domestic Life, in 1891 but had been widely forgotten until scholar Gretchen Gerzina, author of the books Black London and Black Victorians/Black Victoriana, found a passing mention of Farro in an 1893 edition of the British Daily Telegraph. This chance discovery led Gerzina on a quest to find out more about Farro\u2019s life and work.\n\nGerzina writes of Sarah E. Farro\u2019s novel: \u201cSurely those writers owe her a debt of gratitude, just as we have an obligation to bring her back into the fold of African-American and women novelists and to think about how these discoveries change our views of the African-American experience.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn celebration of Gerzina\u2019s discovery, here are 12 other black writers who wrote novels during the 19th century.\n\n\n\nIt was first published in England in 1853, but later versions were published in 1861, 1864 and 1867 under the various titles Miralda: or, The Beautiful Quadroon; A Romance of American Slavery; Founded on Fact, Clotelle: A Tale of the Southern States; and Clotelle: or, The Colored Heroine. Loosely based on the rape of Sally Hemmings by Thomas Jefferson\u2014and the lives of their children\u2014this novel is unique in its value not just as a historical artifact but also for the quality of its literary craftsmanship. William Wells Brown, a former slave, established himself as an immensely talented writer, creating not just novels but also poetry, essays and plays.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. The Heroic Slave: A Thrilling Narrative of the Adventures of Madison Washington, by Frederick Douglass\n\nThe abolitionist and former slave whose best-known literary work is The Narrative of Frederick Douglass also wrote this novella. Published in 1853, it is based on the real-life mutiny led by Madison Washington on board the slave ship Creole in 1841.\n\n\n\n3. The Bondwoman\u2019s Narrative, by Hannah Crafts (also known as Hannah Bond)\n\nDiscovered by Henry Louis Gates Jr., Hannah Crafts is the definite first female black American novelist of known record. States Hecimovich, who helped authenticate the text: \u201cForensic details related to paper and ink, as well as internal evidence, demonstrate that the novel was begun in 1857 and completed in 1858.\u201d The novel, however, remained unpublished until 2002. Here Crafts, an escaped slave, writes a fictional account of a young girl who escapes from slavery for freedom in the North, dodging slave catchers and other perilous trials along the way.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. The Garies and Their Friends, by Frank J. Webb\n\nThis 1857 publication is the sprawling, epic story of two mixed-race families, one living in the North and one living in the South. Fearing for the safety of her biracial children, black slave Emily convinces Clarence Garie, her white owner and father of her children, to move North, too. However, racial prejudice is just as bad in the North and they must navigate continual violence that threatens their lives.\n\n\n\n5. Our Nig; or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black, by Harriet E. Wilson\n\nFirst published in 1859, Our Nig is the story of Frado, an abandoned half-black, half-white girl who grows up as an indentured servant to an abusive white family in 19th-century Massachusetts. Although it is based on Harriet E. Wilson\u2019s real life, she later overcame her harsh childhood and became a spiritualist and an advocate for children\u2019s rights and labor reform. The first novel ever published by a black woman, it was discovered and authenticated by Gates in 1981 and republished it in 1982.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. The Rise and Progress of the Kingdoms of Light and Darkness, by Lorenzo D. Blackson\n\nFirst published in 1867, Lorenzo D. Blackson\u2019s novel is characterized as a Christian utopia exploring his deep Christian beliefs. Blending romance, family drama and philosophy, he crafts a picture of a better, more just society.\n\n\n\n7. Clarence and Corinne, or God\u2019s Way, by Amelia E. Johnson\n\nIn 1890 Amelia E. Johnson published the first of her novels, Clarence and Corinne, or God\u2019s Way. In an experimental use of textual artifacts within the book, Johnson explores the story of alcoholism and addiction that destroys a family and renders two young children orphans.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Iola Leroy; or, Shadows Uplifted, by Frances Harper\n\nA founding member of the National Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs, Frances Harper was also a lecturer and poet. Here, Harper pens the fictional story of Iola Leroy, a young biracial woman raised as white, only to be sold into slavery after her white father\u2019s death. Iola, however, embraces her blackness and triumphs over adversity. This novel, published in 1892, became one of the best-selling African-American novels of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n9. The Hazeley Family, by Amelia E. Johnson\n\nThe second of Amelia E. Johnson\u2019s novels, published in 1894 by the American Baptist Publication Society, again draws heavily on religious and domestic themes that characterized Johnson\u2019s work. Here, Johnson focused less on fictional drama and more on portraying Christian domestic values.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The Uncalled, by Paul Laurence Dunbar\n\nAlthough best known for his acclaimed poetry, Paul Laurence Dunbar first published The Uncalled, one of his five novels, in 1898. Here we are introduced to Freddie Bent, abandoned in an orphanage after the death of his mother. Adopted by Miss Hester Prime, who vows that young Freddie will become a preacher, Freddie struggles to come of age and gain his independence. Here is a master of language at work.\n\n\n\n11. Imperium in Imperio, by Sutton Griggs\n\nEerily prophetic, Griggs\u2019 novel explores the friendship between two young men: one is biracial and a black power militant along the lines of Malcolm X, while the other is a black man who embraces the more nonviolent methods of Martin Luther King Jr. Together the two men form a political movement for black empowerment. This is still a timely, powerful read that had immense success when it was first published in 1899.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Charles Chestnutt\u2019s novel Mandy Oxendine was written in 1897, it was not published until 1997 because of its content: an exploration of two biracial lovers, one who lives in the black community and one who lives in the white community. It was his novel House Behind the Cedars, another story of biracial identity and passing between white and black worlds, that was first published just after the turn of the century in 1900.\n\nHope Wabuke is a Southern California-based writer and a contributing editor at The Root.

Then they concocted some nonsense about Barack Obama being educated in a Muslim madrassa. When that didn\u2019t work, they tried to say he went to a church that was too black because his pastor preached \u201cliberation theology.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly a decade of failed attempts to unearth anything in Obama\u2019s past that might make him look bad, his detractors have settled on one desperate, last-ditch effort to paint the former president in a bad light:\n\nApparently, the only reason Barack Obama married Michelle Obama is that she\u2019s black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the time-honored tradition of bringing up old shit (except for slavery, Jim Crow, lynching, segregation and the government-sanctioned tradition of apartheid known as redlining\u2014all of which are off-limits in any discussion about history), two new biographies of Barack Obama have managed to unearth former girlfriends who want to throw shade at his marriage with Michelle Obama.\n\nIn two new books by Pulitzer Prize winners David Maraniss and David Garrow, the authors dug deep into Barack Obama\u2019s past to look at the making of the 44th president of the United States. Although the works seek to present an objective view of his prepresidential story, media outlets immediately seized on the details of President Obama\u2019s love life. In what seems like unbelievable news to some people, they reveal that Barack Obama apparently had multiple girlfriends before he met Michelle and\u2014please hold on to your hats for this one\u2014even had sex with them!\n\nAlthough Barack Obama has said that when he wrote his books, he made sure \u201cnot to write about my girlfriends, partly out of respect for them,\u201d according to Vanity Fair. in these new works, a string of exes reveal the intimate details of their relationships with him. The former companions shared love letters, journals and private conversations between them and the future leader of the free world because you know what they say: \u201cOnce you go black ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... we\u2019ll let you come back if you dry-snitch.\u201d\n\nIn Garrow\u2019s Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama, the author interviewed more than 1,000 subjects over nine years to create a portrait of the former commander in chief\u2019s early years. In doing so, Garrow managed to dig up a few of Obama\u2019s old flames to dish dirt that would be routine in the story of any other president.\n\nFor instance, Genevieve Cook, who claims that she slept with Obama on their first date and knows she was nothing more than a \u201cpassing phase\u201d in his love life, revealed that Obama experimented with cocaine, \u201cthough Obama was not that into it. For every five lines that somebody did, he would have done half,\u201d she says, according to the Daily Mail. Another anonymous source reveals that Obama \u201cthought about\u201d a homosexual relationship while in college.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama eventually moved on from Cook and dated Sheila Miyoshi Jager, a woman of Dutch-and-Japanese descent. Obama dated Jager for a couple of years, living with her in Chicago and\u2014according to Garrow\u2014breaking up with her because he believed he needed to \u201cfully identify as African American\u201d to reach his political goals. The woman says that Obama twice asked for her hand in marriage, but the discussion dragged on, according to The Guardian:\n\nIt was affected by what Sheila describes as Barack\u2019s \u201ctorment over this central issue of his life,\u201d the question of his own \u201crace and identity.\u201d The \u201cresolution of his \u2018black\u2019 identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career\u201d and to the crystallization of the \u201cdrive and desire to become the most powerful person in the world.\u201d\n\nVanity Fair\u2019s June issue features a portion of Maraniss\u2019 Barack Obama: The Story, which includes excerpts from Cook\u2019s diary describing their sex life, Obama meeting her parents and their breakup, revealing, \u201cIn his own quest to resolve his ambivalence about black and white, it became very, very clear to me that he needed to go black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile both books tell the story of these women and others (Alex McNear, who shared Obama\u2019s love letters, and Lena Montes, a divorced, Hispanic mother of three), they all commented that over those varying years and relationships, Obama was deeply concerned with the subject of race.\n\nYet a recurring theme in these revelations is either the authors\u2019 or the former girlfriends\u2019 insinuation that it was his political ambition that led him to Michelle Obama. From Garrow\u2019s book, according to The Guardian:\n\n\u201cBut if Barack truly believed that his destiny entailed what he thought, he knew full well the value of having roots in one place and having that place be essential to your journey. And who more than Michelle Robinson and her family could personify the strong, deep roots of black Chicago?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the fact that Michelle was Ivy league-educated, beautiful, smart and ambitious obviously meant very little to Barack in his choice of her over them. The fact that the Robinson family accepted him, or the lure of an independently successful woman, couldn\u2019t have had anything to do with it. It must be because Michelle was black.\n\nTheir discounting a 25-year marriage as resulting from a combination of a hunger for power and a reluctant acceptance of society\u2019s prejudice might not be racist\u2014it might simply be narcissism. But the way they reduce Michelle and the entire relationship to her simply being a \u201cblack woman\u201d is reductive in the same great, white-liberal way that black people become either \u201cthugs,\u201d \u201cunderprivileged\u201d or \u201cone of the good ones.\u201d Most people would like to think that they were the truest love in their exes\u2019 lives, and no one wants to think that their old sweethearts actually moved on to something better.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps Barack Obama did marry Michelle because she was black. If\u2014as every one of these women reportedly said\u2014Barack was obsessed with questions of race and self-identity, then it makes sense that he would have gravitated toward someone who identified with his innermost thoughts about himself. If college is the time when people discover who they truly are, it isn\u2019t inconceivable\u2014or even salacious\u2014that after living in Chicago, New York, Hawaii, Kansas and California, Barack Obama reached the conclusion that no matter where he went, he was black, so he wanted to be with a black woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese women might not be bitter, but they might not understand that\u2014although there is a part of blackness that can be verbalized to them\u2014someone who is not black can never truly know it. While it might be a difficult concept for white biographers and for Caucasian women whom society has deemed the gold standard of beauty and femininity to grasp, there is the possibility that a man who contemplated and even questioned his blackness his entire life might want someone who he felt truly knew him completely. Maybe the resilience of white self-esteem prevents white women from believing that they were the same as lines of cocaine, magic mushrooms or bell-bottom jeans: just something stupid he did in college.\n\nIn Dreams of My Father, Barack Obama wrote:\n\nOne night I took her to see a new play by a black playwright. It was a very angry play, but very funny. Typical black American humor. The audience was mostly black, and everybody was laughing and clapping and hollering like they were in church. After the play was over, my friend started talking about why black people were so angry all the time. I said it was a matter of remembering\u2014nobody asks why Jews remember the Holocaust, I think I said\u2014and she said that\u2019s different, and I said it wasn\u2019t, and she said that anger was just a dead end. We had a big fight, right in front of the theater. When we got back to the car she started crying. She couldn\u2019t be black, she said. She would if she could, but she couldn\u2019t. She could only be herself, and wasn\u2019t that enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe, for Barack Obama, Michelle was more than enough.", "keywords": ["attempting", "white", "woman", "life", "black", "obama", "barack", "michelles", "authors", "michelle", "obamas", "delegitimize", "women", "old", "girlfriends", "love"], "polarity": 0.05025540329768269, "subjectivity": 0.4451799507681859},

When the Paris section of the film starts, you see mid-20th-century black-and-white footage of a security guard opening huge iron gates that lead to the Eiffel Tower while Ellington and Coltrane\u2019s recording of \u201cIn a Sentimental Mood\u201d fills the mind and the screen.\n\nThe film means the world to me. I\u2019ve seen it about 20 times. The first time was when it aired on PBS\u2019 American Masters, an artist-profile documentary series, around 1990. It unquestionably changed the direction of my life. When my hometown hero, Amiri Baraka, eulogized Baldwin in an early scene, proclaiming for the ages, \u201cHe lived his life as witness. He wrote until the end. \u2026 Let our black hearts grow big absorbing eyes like his, never closed,\u201d my 22-year-old local-newspaper-reporter sense of the world expanded, and my purpose was set.\n\nA quarter of a century of advanced degrees, massive debt and many, many lonely days and nights behind a computer screen followed. The search for moments of spiritual communion with my champion, the attempts to find and grasp all the (musical and handwritten) notes now embedded, have been only partially successful.\n\nSo it was not optional for me to attend the James Baldwin International Conference, sponsored by the American University of Paris. Nor did it seem to be for the group of about 240 scholars, activists, artists and just plain folks of all races and places who, over this past weekend, just wanted to take in some of the man\u2019s and the city\u2019s cultural-historical energy between gulps of cheese, ham, bread and wine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxine Gordon, the widow and in-process biographer of the jazz legend Dexter, was there. So was the renowned poet Jessica Care moore, whom I last saw when she practically split apart Baraka\u2019s 2014 funeral with her eulogy. But so were many black hip-hop-gen scholars, like Natalie Graham, assistant professor of African-American studies at California State University, Fullerton, who explained that she had done some academic work comparing Baldwin\u2019s use of narrative voice, especially in his novel Giovanni\u2019s Room, with the work of Kendrick Lamar, the man called hip-hop\u2019s Coltrane. The conference organizers, Alice Craven and William Dow, referred to \u201cBaldwin studies,\u201d a term I had never heard before. It was that kind of confab, melding art performance with academic pedagogy, history with literature and, as was discussed in many of its 44 panel discussions, Baldwin with his 21st-century h\u00e9ritier pr\u00e9somptif, Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nThe Baldwin kaleidoscope of shattered barriers reflected throughout the weekend. On the Thursday-night opening plenary panel on the state of \u201cBaldwin studies,\u201d Magdalena J. Zaborowska, a full professor in the department of American culture at the University of Michigan, reminded the audience that Baldwin is an \u201cancestor of sexual minorities.\u201d He broke the binaries of black and white, straight and LGBTQ, she said. His life and work, she summarized, was one of resistance to categorization. During the panel discussion Friday of Baldwin\u2019s work as a playwright and journalist, Pekka Kilpel\u00e4inen, an academy research fellow of the University of Eastern Finland\u2019s department of English language and culture, talked about how Baldwin\u2019s worldview transcended America and its narrow cultural ideals in his last (and unfinished) play, The Welcome Table.\n\nAt an American Embassy keynote Friday, Robert Reid-Pharr, a professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, cautioned about the dangers of trying to imitate Baldwin\u2019s level of accomplishment. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you\u201d was his refrain, because of the obvious pitfalls of being \u201chaunted\u201d by a chosen extraordinary conqueror. He wanted the group to step out of Baldwin\u2019s shadow just long enough to avoid confusing great accomplishment with real living. \u201cYour life matters,\u201d he told the conferees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it was nearly impossible not to respond to this dead writer\u2019s looming, powerfully welcoming call, and frankly, who in this crowd wanted to resist it, really?\n\nDefinitely not when, in a Saturday-morning session on Baldwin\u2019s relationship to his adopted country, he declared the following in the 1971 documentary Meeting the Man: James Baldwin in Paris, while standing in front of the Bastille, the fortress/state prison that was stormed during the French Revolution: \u201cI could be Bobby Seale. I could be Angela Davis. I could be Medgar Evers. \u2026 I\u2019m a black man in the middle of this century. \u2026 I\u2019m not at all what you think I am.\u201d\n\nWhile still standing, Baldwin mentioned that America has political prisoners, a statement that today would be relegated to the nation\u2019s margins. When white men tear down a prison, Baldwin continued, schooling his ignorant European interviewer, it\u2019s considered liberation, but when blacks do it, it\u2019s considered an act of savagery. The idea? \u201cThat you, for me, is my prison. You are my warden.\u201d So much for the stereotype of Baldwin, who resisted being called an expatriate, being seduced by France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe zeitgeist, then and now, is ever present. Later in the film, surrounded by his mentor Beauford Delaney and a smattering of \u201cRight on\u201d-ing black American students, Baldwin talked about how he dealt with life\u2019s division of labor. He said he knew that he couldn\u2019t drive a truck, but \u201cI can f\u2014k with your mind!\u201d Laughter on-screen and off, in 1971 and in 2016. In the film\u2019s closing interview, he was asked whether he\u2019s a revolutionary writer. \u201cI\u2019m a writer in a revolutionary situation,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Price of the Ticket documentary, screened at the conference\u2019s close Saturday, served as a summary of the proceedings. Producer-director Karen Thorsen and co-producer Douglas Dempsey were on hand and included in their remarks a tribute to co-producer William Miles, a black documentary-filmmaking pioneer who became an ancestor in 2013.\n\nSo when the remastered film had finished screening (my 21st time?), the scholars and activists who had spent all weekend soberly analyzing one of their literary and social idols began to wipe their tears. Their metaphysical, extended visit\u2014their collective communion\u2014with Baldwin ended, their witness to his life and work born, for at least the frozen moment. They then rose from their seats and sprinkled themselves into the springtime Paris night. As I walked away from the university, turning the corner (in more ways than one), I struggled in vain not to think of Baldwin\u2019s great smile and not to hear the obvious song start.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Yes. Obnoxious? Perhaps; depends upon whom you ask. But it\u2019s true, and I won\u2019t apologize for leading with it. It\u2019s a cherished accomplishment and, in my rougher moments, a much-needed reminder.\n\nBut does it make me inherently \u201cspecial\u201d?\n\n\n\nThis question came to mind as I read \u201cHaving a Baby Isn\u2019t a Miracle and Doesn\u2019t Make You a Goddess,\u201d the New York Post op-ed attacking a pregnant Beyonc\u00e9 for evoking the deity Oshun\u2014or, as interpreted by this writer, the Virgin Mary (whom we might still recognize as the Black Madonna)\u2014on the 2017 Grammy stage, as she had previously in her nine-time-nominated visual album, Lemonade.\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the writer\u2019s indignation: How dare Beyonc\u00e9 declare herself special. It\u2019s worth mentioning that this writer was once fired for arguing to eliminate black studies curricula. Truthfully, this is a piece so embarrassingly ugly in its assessment, I hesitate to even link to it. (As a palate cleanser, I suggest the rebuttal it inspired: \u201cWhy You So Obsessed With Me: How Beyonc\u00e9 Exposes the Insecurity of White Women.\u201d It\u2019s a sublime read, and I heartily encourage you to feast thine eyes upon it.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Beyonc\u00e9 never called herself a goddess. She didn\u2019t have to. She just showed up and Beyonc\u00e9d (yes, it\u2019s a verb). This time, with two babies on board.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a member of the \u201cHive\u201d to acknowledge that pregnant or not, few accomplish what Beyonc\u00e9 does in an average year, let alone this past one. Many believe that makes her special, but what she admirably did with Lemonade was make others\u2014namely, black women\u2014feel special. And despite being a woman\u2014and mother\u2014herself, that offended this white writer, likely because she wasn\u2019t included in that narrative. Hers is inherently a judgment call on who deserves to be considered special, and by what criteria. And as seen here, it\u2019s gross.\n\n\n\nBut we do this, too, don\u2019t we?\n\n\n\nBy \u201cwe,\u201d I mean black folks. For centuries, we\u2019ve subscribed to any number of arbitrary criteria (skin color, class, hair texture, education level, etc.) to set our already-marginalized selves apart and, whenever possible, above. And while this is understandably an outcome of our history in America\u2014from the field vs. the house to the Talented Tenth and beyond\u2014we continue to revel in any opportunity to distinguish ourselves as \u201cspecial.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most recent iteration of this is perhaps the most fantastical, since it literally draws on mythology to make its point. Ahh, yes ... the fabled and elusive \u201cunicorn.\u201d\n\nInitially used to describe the idealized third partner to a polyamorous duo, in recent years, the term has been appropriated (yes, we do it, too) to describe certain types of black men or women who consider themselves wholly exceptional and, accordingly, entitled to more than everyone else\u2014especially when considering prospective partners.\n\nAlso known as \u201cSpecial Snowflake Syndrome,\u201d this phenomenon evolved alongside those of New Blackness and the friendlier subset who identify as \u201cblerds.\u201d And though there is almost always an argument to be made for being \u201cevenly yoked,\u201d so to speak, there\u2019s a distinctly problematic and even narcissistic streak that runs through the mind of a self-proclaimed \u201cunicorn.\u201d After all, has there ever been any more coveted and magical a creature?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while having an intimate knowledge of anime, a sommelier certification, obsession with Harlem dandy culture or a coding fetish may be a unique, adorable or even admirable trait, it is simply that\u2014not a testament to greatness. And insisting that it\u2019s anything more smacks of a type of snobbishness that is sadly transparent. As humorously noted by online satire site Encyclopedia Dramatica: \u201cScience shows that those who feel insecure about their uniqueness are more likely to constantly assert how unique they are.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd are we handing out participation trophies for adulthood, now? Because it seems that even pedestrian accomplishments, such as holding a job, having a degree or not being a deadbeat parent\u2014or, for men specifically, remaining unmarried and childless well into adulthood\u2014are expected to be cause for applause. Umm ... OK. Frankly, as a heterosexual, single, child-free, career woman now in her 40s, every time I hear a man my age boast about holding out for his \u201clist,\u201d I hear \u201ccommitment-phobe,\u201d not \u201cspecial.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost importantly, to laud basic \u201cadulting\u201d as an accomplishment is to ignore that none of the above would be considered at all exceptional if not for the school-to-prison pipeline, lack of access to economic and educational mobility, and intraracial violence that continue to plague our communities and impact our family structures. So, at whose expense does all that \u201cspecialness\u201d occur, exactly?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile gloating over our awards, degrees, condos, international travel or exclusive memberships to (insert elitist things here), are we being willfully ignorant of the fact that along with our hard work, ambition and intelligence, some of that success (specifically, the ability to claim specialness) is just dumb luck? Because to believe otherwise is to subscribe not only to the myth of the unicorn but also to that of the \u201cgood Negro\u201d in a system never intended for our success. Any specialness we experience is only in relationship to and on the back of blackness itself: pretty (for a black girl), smart (for a black child), articulate (for a black man) ....\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t that special?\n\n\n\nSo, how about this: When it comes to finding a \u201cspecial someone,\u201d maybe it\u2019s time we stop chasing unicorns and hiding behind identity politics. Survival makes us special enough. Better yet, we could take a hint from Queen Bey\u2014and Maya Angelou before her: Maybe you\u2019re only as special as you make someone else feel.\n\n", "keywords": ["snowflake", "success", "having", "goddess", "specialness", "youre", "hurt", "black", "writer", "arent", "unicorns", "beyonc\u00e9", "real", "dont", "special", "yes", "does"], "polarity": 0.13937177901463618, "subjectivity": 0.5029947433518862},

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for. The woman who, no matter what she\u2019s been through, puts on the clothes with her head held high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat beautiful black girls might we expect to see high-stepping on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this season?\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of casting, so no spoilers!\u201d he says. \u201cEach season, we prioritize diversity in our runway casting and do our best to represent the Brandon Maxwell woman: strong, sophisticated and confident.\u201d\n\nYou can trust that The Glow Up will be there to see our beautiful queens serve the people in the next chapter of his fashion fairy tale.", "keywords": ["maxwell", "charm", "maxwells", "video", "model", "love", "campaign", "3rd", "brandon", "believes", "riley", "smalls", "times", "models", "fashion", "designer", "blackgirlmagic"], "polarity": 0.27941388373531234, "subjectivity": 0.556208410636982},

He said that at their first meeting in October 2015, she had not yet released a comprehensive policy dealing with racial justice and was slow to grasp why it was important to have one.\n\n\u201cThe unrest and activism over the last two years has undoubtedly pushed Clinton, specifically on key issues that she and other Democrats otherwise would not have addressed as forcefully as the party\u2019s platform does: private prisons, an increased minimum wage, the role of institutional and implicit bias in sustaining unjust systems and acknowledging the need to address racism directly, to name a few.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMckesson said that Clinton\u2019s platform on racial justice is strong now and a vision of where we need to go. He noted that the policy explicitly calls for the undoing of some key components of the 1994 crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law, including mandatory minimums and the \u201cthree-strikes law.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted her $125 billion Economic Revitalization Initiative, which he said is akin to the New Deal and will invest in youth employment, re-entry, small-business growth and homeownership.\n\nMckesson said that not only will he vote for Clinton, but he will also continue to challenge her on her platform and commitments when she is in the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is much work that lies ahead, and Clinton is ready and prepared to do the hard work.

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["lowes", "stylish", "work", "societys", "knew", "force", "york", "designer", "museum", "gowns", "ann", "secret", "women", "fashion", "lowe", "business"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

But what about black love?\n\n\n\nWhy are there no stock photos of a brother lovingly greasing his woman\u2019s scalp? I searched the greeting card section in Target for hours looking for a greeting card that said, \u201cTo Bae, From Your Nigga ... \u201d and couldn\u2019t find anything! The clerk at the local drugstore just stared at me blankly when I asked why everyone was hugging on the covers of the Valentine\u2019s Day cards instead of grabbing handfuls of their significant other\u2019s booty.\n\nMaybe she didn\u2019t understand black love, but we do. Allow us to fill that void by sharing what we have learned from some of the greatest black romances of all time.\n\nErykah Badu and Andre 3000\n\nI know they\u2019re not together anymore, but that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that Dre and Erykah\u2019s eccentric, wandering, sometimes-verging-on-Hotep vibes were seemingly made for each other. When their romance produced a son named Seven, it even made me want to name my first daughter 3.1415926535897 Yam Harriot, just so I could nickname her\u2014you guessed it\u2014Sweet Potato Pi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we can learn from them: Just because a relationship doesn\u2019t last forever doesn\u2019t mean it was a waste of time. It\u2019s like a party: If you know when to leave, you\u2019ll have great memories. But if you stay too late, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of drunk crying and a big mess to clean up.\n\n\n\nQuincy McCall and Monica Wright\n\nIf you are black and over 30, Love & Basketball is one of the seminal romances of your life, because we have all dreamed of making a happily-ever-after with our high school romance. After successful sports careers, Monica and Quincy ended right back where they began: in the driveway shooting baskets. Plus, this movie reveals one of the biggest identifiers of black love: If he loves you when you\u2019re sweaty and wearing a ponytail, then he loves you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we can learn from them: If you go chase your dreams, the right love will wait for you. Also, if a woman wants to play you in a game of basketball \u201cfor your heart,\u201d apparently a 360-degree-spin move and monster dunk on her is not the right thing to do in that situation.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Hov and Bey have been married for almost a decade (since 2008), but they have. Just last year, Jay Z was getting the side eye from every woman in America as an extensive investigation was underway to find out who was \u201cBecky With the Good Hair.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, what a difference a year makes! Everyone is now giddy after Queen Bey\u2019s Sears Portrait Studio birth announcement (like she\u2019s gonna let y\u2019all babysit), which proves that my theory was correct the entire time. While everyone was trying to decipher whether Jay Z cheated, who it might\u2019ve been with and if they were headed for divorce, I had the most unique hypothesis of them all:\n\nMaybe it was just a song.\n\nWhat we can learn from them: I don\u2019t really know. I just don\u2019t want the Beyhive coming for me because I left Beyonc\u00e9 off a list. Any list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOssie Davis and Ruby Dee\n\nOssie and Ruby\u2019s romance survived the white-hot spotlight of Hollywood. They were the perennial standard of black love for over five decades and even shared in their mutual biography that they had periods of open marriage during their relationship.\n\nWhat we can learn from them: \u201cWe were living one of the great love stories, I think, of the 20th century and we didn\u2019t know it, nobody told us. ... It occurred to us, from observation and reasoning, that extramarital sex was not what really destroyed marriages, but rather the lies and deception that invariably accompanied it\u2014that was the culprit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemy Ma and Papoose\n\n\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: What can two past-their-prime rappers on a VH1 reality show teach us about love?\n\nEverything.\n\nIf you subtract Remy\u2019s ratchetness and Papoose\u2019s endless supply of swap meet New York Yankees caps, what you have left between these two is everyone\u2019s dreams of an ideal, unshakable love. He tried to break her out of prison! And when that didn\u2019t work, he waited for her. If that ain\u2019t black love, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we can learn from them: Patience. Unwavering dedication. Uncompromising love. The exact angle to correctly tilt a baseball cap.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama\n\n\n\nBarack often told the story of his courtship with Michelle\u2014how she was dismissive of him when they first met, how he asked her for a date and how their love grew. If you didn\u2019t know any of that, you could still tell by the way they look at each other. They seem to have genuine adoration for each other that almost radiates around them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the last few months of his presidency, Barack revealed that Michelle disliked the idea of being first lady, but she did it with style and grace. With the unprecedented animosity and unrelenting antagonism that President Obama faced, perhaps the relationship between him and Michelle was the only respite the world could offer.\n\nWhat we can learn from them: How resilient and sustaining black love can be\u2014even in the vicious political fishbowl filled with wypipo hate.\n\nEllen and William Craft\n\n\n\nThe greatest black love story ever told is one you may have never heard before. In 1837 a biracial slave name Ellen was born to a slave woman and her master in Clinton, Ga., and then given away to a plantation in Macon, Ga., as a wedding gift. There she met her eventual husband, William Craft, and decided they wanted to raise a family, but not in slavery\u2014so they escaped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEllen disguised herself as a white man, wrapped her face in bandages to disguise her lack of a beard, practiced for months to change the way she walked and talked, and eventually boarded a train with \u201cher slave\u201d as her companion. They were almost captured numerous times, and after a train, a steamer and a ferry, they finally arrived safely in Pennsylvania. After they settled in the Northeast, they began touring the country giving anti-slavery lectures, until the U.S. passed the Fugitive Slave Act. Still in fear of being caught, the couple moved to London until they returned to Georgia as a free couple in 1868 after the Civil War.\n\nWhat we can learn from them: This is the ultimate lesson of black love. In the face of every danger and the worst evil, love persists.\n\nAnd resists.\n\nHonorable mentions: Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union, Dwayne Wayne and Whitley Gilbert.", "keywords": ["know", "romances", "woman", "black", "romance", "greatest", "learn", "told", "doesnt", "slave", "love", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.1514641159494101, "subjectivity": 0.5101608875873582},

Nestled between Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and three Snapchat stars was a photo of DeRay Mckesson, accompanied by this text:\n\n\n\nCrowning Achievement: Transforming a Twitter hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter, into a sustained, multi-year, national movement calling for the end of police killings of African-Americans. He may have lost a bid to become Baltimore\u2019s next mayor, but he is the leader of a movement.\n\nMy spirit has been unsettled ever since.\n\nI have not been outwardly vocal about my distrust of and slight contempt for DeRay Mckesson\u2014mostly because his coronation as \"the leader of a movement\" is something that we've seen throughout history. Men either step on the backs of women to snatch accolades and headlines; or, through their loud silence, they become complicit in erasing their names from history.\n\nI lived and worked in Selma, Ala., for many, many years. During that time, one of my jobs was working for the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute. I created community programs, helped to coordinate the annual Bridge Crossing Jubilee festival celebrating the right to vote, and I curated exhibits. For the exhibit work, I had to do mountains of research. In fact, I researched for almost two years before a single picture was put on the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years I had heard firsthand accounts of movement stories, but I still wanted to be as accurate as possible when recounting history for thousands and thousands of eyes. If they were coming to the museum seeking the gospel truth, I wanted to make sure they left with a praise report.\n\nOne of the biggest stories I wanted to ensure was told with the richness and care it deserved was that of Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. I knew Boynton Robinson and her family personally, and I knew of the huge part she played in the Selma movement, but her story had never been told with full accuracy. Disney made a movie called Selma Lord Selma, which blatantly distorted Boynton's role during that time in favor of highlighting Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAva DuVernay's Selma remedied that on some level, but here is what you may not know:\n\nAmelia Boynton\u2014and her husband, Sam Boynton\u2014were founders of the Dallas County Voters League, which had begun doing voter-registration work more than a decade before any member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference or Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee stepped foot in Selma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing had been opposed to going into Selma, partly because he saw the groundwork laid by SNCC two years earlier as a failure, and he wanted to focus on places where they could achieve easier wins. Amelia Boynton wrote the letter that invited King to Selma in January 1965 and eventually changed his mind about choosing Selma as the hub for the next civil rights battle.\n\nDiane Nash was a prominent figure and integral part of the strategy team that laid the ground work for the movement in Selma, yet you will barely hear her name mentioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarie Foster helped to restart the DCVL in the 1960s and was one of the two women\u2014the other being Amelia Boynton\u2014up front on the line and who were badly beaten on Bloody Sunday.\n\nI'm naming these women because unless you do some research, history has largely erased them or diminished their importance.\n\nWe hear all about King, John Lewis, Andrew Young and many other men\u2014as we should. But what of these women? What of Fannie Lou Hamer or Ella Baker? If you study, you may know, but not because you were taught. We hear about Rosa Parks as a \"symbol\" of the civil rights movement, but not as a movement strategist. We know King cut his teeth in the movement with the Montgomery Bus Boycott, but have you ever heard the name Johnnie Carr?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the things I discovered in my research was a woman named Autherine Lucy Foster from Marion, Ala. When Jimmie Lee Jackson was killed, Foster stood up in a mass meeting and said that they should march to Montgomery and lay his body on the steps of the Capitol building. Many people corroborated this story, which floored me because I had always heard that it was James Bevel who came up with the idea. Depending on whom you ask now, you will hear one or the other, or maybe both names.\n\nWe will never know the real truth because when a story is told long enough, it eventually becomes truth to folks. This is why Vanity Fair's list depicting Mckesson as not just \"a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement\"\u2014as he is often erroneously described\u2014but as the singular person who transformed the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag into a \"sustained, multi-year, national movement \u2026 \" is so wrong and disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis false designation not only follows a long history of erasing the work of black women in movement work; it is further evidence of how little white people actually care about the movement at all. For the most part, they seem to scroll through social media, see who's trending and run with it. Their anti-racist work is done.\n\nAs much as we have seen the three founders of the Black Lives Matter organization, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Opal Tometi\u2014who actually started this hashtag and grew it from the web to an organization\u2014this lie that this man is responsible for this work still prevails. And more so, the idea that one man alone is responsible for sparking a movement is ridiculous.\n\nCullors and Darnell L. Moore\u2014in close collaboration with activists and organizers throughout North America\u2014were behind activating folks to ride out to Ferguson, Mo. This revolutionary action effectively kicked off what we now refer to as the \u201cBlack Lives Matter Movement.\" Social and racial justice organizations like the Dream Defenders, which was co-founded by Umi Selah, and Black Youth Project\u2014whose national director Charlene Carruthers has redefined leadership in a generation's consciousness\u2014were doing on-the-ground work before the summer of 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI'm clear that groups like the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, Dec. 12th, and 21st Century Youth Leadership Movement (the organization I grew up in) laid the groundwork for what is happening now\u2014like our elders laid the groundwork for us. Also, now more than ever, when these young organizers are pushing back against the \"single charismatic leader\" model of movement-building, it is important for this type of willful ignorance and cultural negligence to be called out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have seen Mckesson and some of his people go on social media tirades about how they are not a part of Black Lives Matter. That is, until someone from the press says it\u2014then there is no correction. If he won't do it, those who know better need to do so, or else, when this comes up in civics classes 20 years from now, there will be more lies and erasure happening.\n\nWe owe it to those who work on our behalf to tell their stories and honor their contributions. Many of these folks are not getting paid; but they are regularly harassed and threatened, demeaned and challenged. And much too often, the tireless work of women is the half that's never told. If we don't lift them up and protect them, no one else will. Trust me; I've seen it happen over and over and over again.\n\nI don't expect white, mainstream publications like Vanity Fair to get this right. And I don't expect movement interlopers\u2014as many people, including me, perceive Mckesson to be\u2014to correct them. But I do expect us to be vocal and active when we see egregious things like this happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know I will.\n\nTarana Burke is a writer, style blogger and girls advocate.

As Diddy rhymes in the remix to Wal\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cSlight Work\u201d: \u201cHow could you not admire me? Jocking my men entirely, chop the top off the drop and tell \u2019em Basquiat inspired me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLikewise, in one of his many references to the painter, Jay-Z, who reportedly dropped $4.5 million on a single Basquiat canvas, let it flow on the song \u201cPicasso Baby\u201d: \u201cIt ain\u2019t hard to tell, I\u2019m the new Jean-Michel.\u201d\n\nBasquiat, who died in 1988 at the age of 27, illustrated what it meant to be a successful artist for his generation. Blessed with great talent, the artist lived out a strangely fairy-tale existence. Born a middle-class kid in Brooklyn, N.Y., he went from a loving home to living in a cardboard box in New York City\u2019s West Village, where he made his way to becoming an art-world darling in the roaring market of the 1980s, quickly recognized and handsomely rewarded by collectors, institutions and artists alike for his graffiti-inspired art dealing with themes of black identity and personal obsessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasquiat\u2019s works have sold for record-shattering prices, most recently in May 2017, when his work Untitled was bought at Christie\u2019s auction house by the richest man in Japan, billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, for a reported $110.5 million. To date, it is the highest price ever paid for a work by an American artist, a record previously held by Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), by Basquiat\u2019s mentor, pop art icon artist Andy Warhol, which sold for $105.4 million in 2013.\n\nBut not all fairy tales have happy endings. Basquiat\u2019s golden-boy status and meteoric rise were chronicled in the 1996 film Basquiat, made by his friend, painter and Oscar-nominated director Julian Schnabel. It was the Hollywood version of how Basquiat magically lit up the art world, only to sadly flame out in ruins from a heroin overdose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his short life, Basquiat ran in the rock-star world of painters, with Warhol as his champion and mentor. Warhol reportedly never took a drink or drug\u2014and begged Basquiat to get clean, to no avail. The two even collaborated on paintings; Basquiat\u2014who went by the graffiti tag \u201cSAMO\u201d\u2014painted on top of Warhol\u2019s work. It was a version of sampling, marrying one side of pop culture to another.\n\nSean John (SeanJohn.com) Sean John (SeanJohn.com) Sean John (SeanJohn.com) Sean John (SeanJohn.com) 1 / 4\n\nWhat made Basquiat such a fascinating character to many was his uncanny ability to capture his own mysterious inner life, as well as the imaginations driving the market in the seemingly impenetrable art world. Kim Heirston, the black female owner and founder of Kim Heirston Art Advisory, explains Basquiat\u2019s enduring appeal: \u201cLike Leonardo da Vinci or Pablo Picasso, Basquiat inspires each and every one of us to tap into our own artistic genius .... and our own inner wild child.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasquiat is admired as much for his in-your-face art, exploring ongoing themes of skeletons (symbolizing death); crowns (symbols of money, power and respect); and paint dripping and oozing like blood (a visual metaphor for passion and struggle), shot through with text from hip-hop music, where black men\u2019s real and raw speaking voices were being heard for the first time in pop culture.\n\nLike a true graffiti artist, Basquiat painted on canvases, plates, doors, notebook paper, even his girlfriend\u2019s dress, you name it\u2014he painted on whatever was at hand when inspiration seized him. Basquiat rose to the top of the art-world game crowned with natty dreads, open to using questions of his black identity as a way to call into question perceptions of race. He often called his art \u201cignorant art\u201d as an attention-grabbing marketing tactic, then turned around and fought the moniker of being called a \u201cblack painter\u201d as a qualifier.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, a documentary directed by his friend Tamra Davis, is a real and touching portrait of the artist as he most probably saw his own life and work:\n\nLuckily for us, we\u2019ve arrived at an era where important black painters are becoming the norm. Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald\u2019s portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama, respectively, hang in the National Gallery, and more are sure to come. There\u2019s also a long list of important black artists who paved the way for us to go and buy a Sean John x Basquiat T-shirt at Macy\u2019s, on sale this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the collection, the jean jacket, adorned with a marauding T. rex with Basquiat\u2019s iconic gold crown floating above its head like a halo, is particularly poignant. The image is probably most famous from the children\u2019s book Life Doesn\u2019t Frighten Me, published five years after Basquiat\u2019s death in collaboration with poet laureate Maya Angelou. It\u2019s a pleasure to see art and commerce come together to both educate and enrich a new generation.", "keywords": ["jeanmichel", "x", "artist", "work", "painter", "sean", "radiant", "child", "20thanniversary", "black", "john", "art", "collaboration", "basquiats", "basquiat", "seanjohncom", "honoring"], "polarity": 0.19852366383616382, "subjectivity": 0.5378543678543678},

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["lowes", "stylish", "work", "societys", "knew", "force", "york", "designer", "museum", "gowns", "ann", "secret", "women", "fashion", "lowe", "business"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

Like executions, oppression against the black community tends to focus the mind, so I think we\u2019ll see African Americans begin doing a lot of things that we let slip during our Love & Hip Hop, bread and circuses era. The era of black ratchet is officially over; only WorldStar and Andy Cohen don\u2019t know it yet. Below are five good things we\u2019ll see happen from the Cheetos Hitler presidency:\n\n\n\n1. The Head Nod\n\nI never really liked how the show Blackish took a silent cultural cue among black people and turned it into a mainstream pop culture, I-didn\u2019t-know-black-people-did-that piece of trivia for white America. But in a new age where black folks are gonna need a collective sense of awareness as Trump and his head henchman, aka chief strategist, Steve Bannon attempt to erase us as a people, that head nod of acknowledgment is going to become ever more important.\n\n\n\n2. The Return of \u201cBrother\u201d and \u201cSister\u201d\n\nThere was a time when greeting each other as \u201cBrother\u201d or \u201cSister\u201d was as normal as saying \u201cHello\u201d or \u201cGood morning\u201d to complete strangers. And yet the hostility and distrust that this world has bred has made it less and less of an occurrence. Snoop even popularized saying \u201cCousin,\u201d which I could never get with, mainly because it harks back to how Crips greet each other as \u201cCuz,\u201d and I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with being associated with Crips or Bloods. But \u201cbrother\u201d and \u201csister\u201d is who we are\u2014people who don\u2019t buy into the notion that we have to be paranoid about each other, but who love each other unconditionally. Unless you\u2019re Omarosa. She gets no love.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. House Parties\n\nAs a world of oppression closes in, black folks tend to close ranks, finding comfort in the faces of people who look just like them. It\u2019s about creating private spaces where the jokes all have punch lines that don\u2019t have to be explained to people who say, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Look for Friday-night spades parties or Saturday-night bid whist parties. Look for spontaneous gatherings where nothing is on the agenda except some good food, good laughter and goodwill. And you will go.\n\n\n\n4. Great Literature\n\nI fully expect to read some great literature during these four years. As a writer, I have found that when the pressures of society directly affect you, each story and each word in the stories you write becomes much more important than in the good times. Look for personal stories, biographies, poetry and nonfiction that will illuminate and take you forward in a positive psychological and intellectual way.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Love of Black People\n\nI love black people in the same way that the Last Poets talked about how they loved black people in their revolutionary poem, \u201cN\u2014gers Are Scared of Revolution.\u201d I love our faults, I love our idiosyncrasies and I love how we have fought in this country since 1619 to be seen as human and as rightful citizens of this experiment called the United States. Love each other over the next four years, and then fight like hell to defeat anyone who would attempt to harm you. I have a good feeling about the love we\u2019ll see among one another.\n\nLawrence Ross is the author of the Los Angeles Times best-seller The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities.

A spectrum of vibrant fabrics are stacked to the ceiling, while dress forms stand half-draped in fabric, soon to join the rack of garments hanging along one full wall. In a corner beneath dozens of spools of thread, two industrial sewing machines sit lit and ready to turn out more of designer Whitney Mero\u2019s coveted creations.\n\n\n\nMero created the label over two decades ago; when asked for the origin story, she tossed back her trademark halo of tangled golden curls in laughter: \u201cThere\u2019s a respectable version, and there\u2019s a messy version. Which would you like to hear?\u201d Of course, The Glow Up wanted to hear both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been shapely\u2014even as a child, I had a shape that was challenging for my parents to shop for,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd as a result of that challenge, they put me in very ugly clothes. ... How do you dress a 12-year-old shaped like a grown person?\u201d\n\nAn adolescent Mero took matters into her own hands, getting an after-school job to fund her own clothing budget, shopping at thrift stores and then redesigning her finds into fresh styles. By her junior year in high school, she was making prom dresses for classmates when an older boyfriend suggested that she turn her talent into a business. The prospect was daunting but exciting:\n\nI remember taking a trip to Buffalo to visit a friend. I was talking to her mom about my idea and what I wanted to do, but having no clue how to do any of it. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, with all that ass you need to call it \u2018Onion.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the messy version. The respectable version is I\u2019m answering the question, \u201cHow to dress for different kinds of women\u2014different sizes, different shapes, different needs, all while being stylish and comfortable.\u201d And for me that answer\u2014[from] that time onto this time\u2014is Onion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mero tells it, despite any more lascivious overtones, the term \u201cOnion\u201d originated as a Southern euphemism for shapely figures. Forgoing fashion school in favor of Spelman College in her native Atlanta, she majored in sociology while continuing to hone her craft.\n\nAfter graduation and a stint in China, she based herself and her burgeoning business in New York City, where she began hosting trunk shows for her growing clientele. That\u2019s how Mero, an introvert who admits to being leery of the social aspects of retail, likes it:\n\n\n\nGrowing up, the idea of having a store where somebody would just have access to me was just not going to happen\u2014me having a place where you could just walk in? Fuck that. So I started at an early age, very early in the business, having these trunk sales. And then you can invite the people. You can set the tone, you get to control the setting ... it never occurred to me to have brick-and-mortar\u2014not just for that reason; the overhead is murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer lack of overhead, coupled with the growth of online retail, provided a model that perfectly suited both Mero\u2019s personality and the growth of Onion Cut & Sewn. Her line is a rarity in the retail sector: There are no manufacturers, and everything is truly cut and sewn by hand from whole cloth in the workshop that Mero also staffs and owns. Orders are as made-to-measure as possible and take 12-14 days to produce.\n\nMero describes it as \u201cpret-a-porter meets couture,\u201d yet amazingly, every item in her extensive line of dresses, separates and jumpsuits retails for under $200. It\u2019s a point of pride for the designer, all due to the strength of her online business:\n\nOnion should not be here; it\u2019s a beautiful accident. It should have been a lot harder for me. Having a store online and being able to take payments from damn near anywhere from anyone is really what grew the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while technology makes it infinitely easier to sell, it\u2019s Mero\u2019s technical skill that developed her faithful following. She loves draping and primarily cuts on the bias; in her words: \u201cI love it when fabric moves with you, as opposed to you trying to make fabric do something that it doesn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nAs a result, her designs\u2014some with names like \u201ctrap dress\u201d and \u201cfast lady\u201d\u2014naturally flatter a variety of figures. While undeniably feminine, they are never fussy, and remarkably feel as good as they are fashionable, thanks to Onion\u2019s signature fabric: jersey. Mero stumbled upon her favorite fabric almost by accident, but it\u2019s since become instrumental in creating the comfortable couture Onion is known for:\n\nI got really sick about 10 years ago, and I needed comfortable clothes. My skin was really jacked up, and I needed something that actually was soft and comforting. I started working with jersey, and then I just fell in love with it. ... I mean, I\u2019ve seen dresses fit a size 2, put that dress down and [get] picked up by a size 16, and it worked. You know, Miss Celie\u2019s pants. But I\u2019m a huge fan of jersey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her love for the stretchy, travel-friendly cottons and rayons she uses in most of her designs, Mero is seemingly also her own muse. Her enviably compact and curvy frame is an ideal and relatable mannequin for her array of body-conscious but very forgiving silhouettes, and visitors to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s site will find the designer herself modeling most of her collection.\n\nIt could be argued that Mero represents the type of aspirational yet accessible allure her customers are seeking with every Onion purchase. But in her studio, she is refreshingly frank and unassuming, dressed down in a hoodie with her incredible hair in orbit around a bare face, while her impeccable cobalt manicure makes one wonder how she so effectively maneuvers a sewing machine. It\u2019s all part of Mero\u2019s personal credo, which extends to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s philosophy:\n\nYou put something on, and you feel great. I need it to feel like pajamas. ... But you know, the goal is, at the most, fundamental: Put one thing on and be able to leave the house and feel completely comfortable and confident in what you\u2019re wearing ... I want to design a star for people\u2014something that shines on you, without you necessarily having to shine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd women truly do shine in Mero\u2019s designs. Just ask good friend and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, who wore a sequined black dress designed by Mero to grace this year\u2019s Golden Globes carpet. As Burke told The Glow Up:\n\nWhitney is a friend, but I have a very separate obsession with Onion Cut & Sewn. There was no question that I was going to wear one of her amazing creations on the red carpet at the Golden Globes. All of the women that night shied away from questions about who they were wearing, but I couldn\u2019t wait. I was proud to wear a black designer and proud to be wearing my girl\u2019s design. She makes impeccably tailored, comfortable, beautifully designed dresses, and the world should know about them.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while Mero finds Burke\u2019s choice to wear her design to the Golden Globes deeply meaningful, she says she couldn\u2019t care less about courting celebrity:\n\nYou know, people are celebrity-obsessed\u2014actually starstruck in a way that makes no sense. And I get that question: Well, what celebrities do you dress? And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck [do] I need to dress celebrities for? I dress you. And unless you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re not good enough\u2014which is not something I\u2019m ready to accept\u2014then stop asking me about celebrities.

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["getty", "marvel", "look", "film", "veronica", "style", "black", "images", "styles", "wear", "wanna", "fashion", "love", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

Long story short, Remy Ma wasn\u2019t lying in that \u201cAnte Up\u201d verse.\n\nWhen I first heard the cast announcement for this season, I was more than excited to see the return of Remy Ma to my screen, even if it wasn\u2019t in the form of new music.

He championed her through a six year bid (including getting in a fistfight with Fat Joe pre-weight loss surgery), married her during that time, and was ready to give her the world on his return. He took her to what looks like the Medieval Times Castle as a potential site for their wedding! I can only hope that my future husband can love me the way Pap loves Remy and Avirex jackets.\n\nSecondly, everything about their relationship is peak Blackness. I mean, just take a gander at this photo. Remy is in pin-curls, playing chess with her husband who is in top to bottom camouflage. There\u2019s a ninety percent chance that our lady Reminisce smells like Lovespell. What do you think they\u2019re playing for? The big piece of chicken? Flaming hot cheetos? Honeybuns? The possibilities are ENDLESS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, we\u2019ve only seen two episodes, so my excitement may be a bit premature. But considering the rest of the cast features a man who moved his baby momma and side chick down the hall from his wife, I\u2019m ready for the stability of this hood love.

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["lowes", "stylish", "work", "societys", "knew", "force", "york", "designer", "museum", "gowns", "ann", "secret", "women", "fashion", "lowe", "business"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints.

But the collection never quite seems to get its props, likely because the label lacks the flash of a star designer or the power derived from dressing celebrities necessary for a fashion house to capture a place in pop culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I do like its take on dressing women\u2014it\u2019s sensible and sexy in the same breath\u2014with wonderful choices for women who wear the hijab. Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016. Now beautiful models with conservative beliefs are taking their turn and their respect as they walk the runways.\n\nMax Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I said, I like the moment we\u2019re in right now: a movement toward inclusion, and celebrating power on the runways.

The concept of a collective \"Black Love\" is ambiguous, arbitrary, and kinda, sorta ridiculous. But that doesn't prevent people from feeling like it's real. Or should be real. So when a prominent Black couple splits \u2014 and this includes celebrities and people within non-celebrity social circles \u2014 it's felt. Not by everyone, obviously. But there are people \u2014 women and men \u2014 who hear of a Khalifa/Rose split or the Carter's rumored marriage issues or the news that cute couple from church are getting a divorce and get legitimately bummed out by it. Not because of how happy they were for them, but because it gives them a little less hope that type of happiness is obtainable and sustainable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly enough, it feels like the more likely someone is to be enamored with the concept of \"Black Love\" \u2014 at least in relation to celebrities and other couples they don't personally know \u2014 the more likely they are to be pessimistic about their own relationship lives. This is not a ground-breaking discovery. It makes perfect sense that people dissatisfied with their own relationship lives would latch on to a fabricated replication of how relationships should look and feel. But \u2014 and, before I continue, let me remind you this is just a theory (basically, if you accused me of pulling it out of my ass, I wouldn't deny it) \u2014 what I've also observed is that this dissatisfaction isn't internal. It's not them wondering if they'll ever be able to find a man/woman who likes them. It's them wondering if they'll ever be able to find a man/woman they'll actually like.\n\nAnd this is the paradox. We (collectively) believe in Black Love. Or, want to believe, rather. But we (collectively) don't seem to like each other very much.", "keywords": ["really", "split", "relationship", "black", "believing", "theyll", "rooms", "weed", "wondering", "couple", "liking", "real", "love"], "polarity": 0.16969202898550723, "subjectivity": 0.5596376811594205},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?). Coupled with the gold neck rings by Black Panther jewelry, Okoye\u2019s look was giving us \u201990s-era Donna Karan\u2014or contemporary Cushnie et Ochs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Slaven Vlasic (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut who can forget the gorgeous blankets worn by W\u2019Kabi\u2019s Border tribe and, later, by the royal family during their escape? Inspired by the Basotho blankets of South Africa, these were perhaps the most covetable pieces in the film, featuring saturated hues and traditional honeycomb patterns, embellished with foiled patterns as a foreshadowing of their dual use as force field shields in the film.\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDying to have one of my very own, I instantly went in search of these incredible blankets, which are almost exclusively produced by South African company Aranda. But never fear: The company does export (though you\u2019ll have to convert the currency from rands), and a limited number are also available stateside via retailers Accompany and Blankets and Weaves.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to draping a couple of these across my furniture; but ever the fashionista, Veronica is envisioning Basotho blanket jackets for fall, which my intrepid search turned up on none other than Etsy. South African retailers Weiss Capetown create made-to-order Basotho jackets in a variety of styles and colors. So, now, we can all be wrapped up in our love for Wakanda.\n\nOf course, there were plenty more looks to love from Black Panther\u2014for instance, the 3-D printed shrugs and and Cameroonian-inspired headdresses Carter created for Angela Bassett\u2019s Queen Ramonda were literal works of art. But if you\u2019re looking for more than a T-shirt to commemorate your trip to our imaginary homeland, you don\u2019t need a Royal Talon Fighter to get them!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["getty", "marvel", "look", "film", "veronica", "style", "black", "images", "styles", "wear", "wanna", "fashion", "love", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.19586086243853235, "subjectivity": 0.4879964695498675},

But Maxwell-Reid had groundbreaking firsts as a black woman: the 1969 cover of Glamour magazine, and homecoming queen at the prestigious Northwestern University in Chicago.\n\n\n\nOn behalf of The Glow Up, stylist and entertainment reporter Marcellas Reynolds had the pleasure of talking with Maxwell-Reid about her incredible firsts\u2014decades before she became the second \u201cAunt Viv.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up: Daphne, how did you get discovered?\n\nDaphne Maxwell-Reid: My English teacher suggested me for Seventeen magazine my freshman year at Northwestern. That led to meeting Eileen Ford, the legendary owner of Ford Models. At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award. The current university president apologized, asked me to crown the new homecoming queen and to join the advisory board.\n\nDaphne Maxwell is crowned homecoming queen of Northwestern University in 1967.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite. I thought, \u201cHoly cow! I\u2019m in a great bunch!\u201d It was a Ladies Home Journal article: \u201cFourteen Most Beautiful Women in the World.\u201d I was chosen as one of them. I was floored! It was 1968 or 1969, when Ladies Home Journal was a big magazine. Supermodel Cheryl Tiegs was in that picture.\n\n\n\nTGU: The path from model to actress seems to have been easy for you.\n\n\n\nDMR: I was a curious, adventurous woman. I had no qualms about walking through another door. My career and life have been luck, guided by a higher power.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What is the biggest life lesson modeling taught you?\n\n\n\nDMR: Modeling taught me about self-love, and to separate work from real life. If you don\u2019t get a job or a booking, it is not about you, so don\u2019t be unhappy, because that was not your job.\n\n\n\nTGU: How have you seen things change in entertainment and fashion?\n\n\n\nDMR: I have seen that it has become more acceptable to be the person that you are. I have seen the dominant culture open their eyes\u2014or have their eyes opened to\u2014the possibility that there is something else out there they were not aware of, and that was us [black people]. The acceptance of that I have seen go through many changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I first started on television, I was one of a few black women who was doing network television.

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["lowes", "stylish", "work", "societys", "knew", "force", "york", "designer", "museum", "gowns", "ann", "secret", "women", "fashion", "lowe", "business"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked. Internships are a critical part of the process for successful careers, and Fashion Tech Connects is there to provide qualified candidates with both education and, for those who rise to the top, entree into coveted fashion internships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we look at the current landscape of technology and fashion leadership, there is an obvious lack of women of color,\u201d says Horton, whose new executive role at Alexander Wang was reportedly the inspiration behind this season\u2019s fashion show, featuring models dressed as an army of high-powered female executives.\n\nIf Horton has her way, squads of black female power brokers are about to be on the next runway to reality 2.0.", "keywords": ["doesnt", "alexander", "wang", "vogue", "york", "stephanie", "tech", "women", "horton", "executive", "soars", "fashion", "marketing", "business"], "polarity": 0.19978698550127125, "subjectivity": 0.4454098811241669},

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["lowes", "stylish", "work", "societys", "knew", "force", "york", "designer", "museum", "gowns", "ann", "secret", "women", "fashion", "lowe", "business"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even among our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\nEspecially in considering Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th president\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u201cexclude the idea of color as race,\u201d she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling just over a week ago, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, one made by American (semi-)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Ala. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great Southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the Stars and Stripes famously hand-sewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that makes up the country her husband so recently led?\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown at the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South:\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u201ctruthful\u201d\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Ala., with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 census. In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. visited the enclave\u2014primarily African American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry\u2014three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York City mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the Creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be shortsighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former first lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because, ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder? Said Cabrera:\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out, and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us who, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic for our first black first lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d", "keywords": ["portrait", "quilts", "gees", "dress", "black", "obama", "included", "michelle", "lady", "bend", "picture", "think"], "polarity": 0.14501168400422132, "subjectivity": 0.4232492838836122},

But admittedly, we can sometimes get a bit myopic and materialistic when covering fashion shows and the latest looks on the red carpet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re grateful that International Women\u2019s Day exists, to pull us out of our own beauty- and fashion-obsessed heads, for a least a day.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019d like to make that broader focus last more than just today\u2014and last at least all month, since it\u2019s also Women\u2019s History Month. When we thought about how we wanted to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, we thought we should focus on something that has an ongoing positive impact in women\u2019s lives. Fittingly, we settled on something that also happens to be one of our favorite activities: shopping.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is \u201cTime Is Now: Rural and Urban Activists Transforming Women\u2019s Lives.\u201d Notably, there are fashion brands and entrepreneurial initiatives around the world doing the work of supporting and empowering women around the world. So don\u2019t just drop a dollar; drop gems by spending your money with female entrepreneurs who are trying to turn the world around, one thoughtful purchase at a time.\n\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries on the planet, where only 33 percent of school-age children ever attend school. In Chichewa, Malawi\u2019s native language, tiwale means \u201clet us shine/glow.\u201d This youth-led, community-based organization, founded by DJ, artist and one of Forbes\u2019 Africa\u2019s 30 Under 30 Ellen Chilemba, has a stated mission of \u201cempowering women to develop sustainable ventures that transform our communities from poverty-stricken to entrepreneur-vital.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiwale runs programs providing school grants and mentorship, training, microloans and even a blog featuring African female writers. The goods produced are for sale on its site; 40 percent go back to the participants of the program, while the remaining 60 percent support Tiwale\u2019s programming.\n\nThis charity and brand creates ethical and sustainable womenswear and lifestyle items, produced in the Mayamiko Fashion Lab in Malawi by the team of tailors, pattern cutters and seamstresses the label trains and employs through fully funded workshops. Founded by Paola Masperi, the Mayamiko Fashion Lab \u201cwas designed to provide training, education, nutrition, sanitation and fairer trade practices to all of those involved ... many of whom are affected by the HIV pandemic or who are carers of HIV orphans. After their training all trainees receive a recognized qualification as well as mentoring, guidance and access to a microfinance scheme, enabling them to start their own business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who choose to stay on with Mayamiko, the label pays living wages \u201cso that more people can be employed and lifted out of poverty.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t you love to start a business doing something you love that, in the process, takes care of black women and their families? That\u2019s exactly what Liya Kebede, the Ethiopian supermodel, actress and mother of two, did when she founded Lemlem, a handwoven-clothing brand for men, women and children with fair-trade production headquartered in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLemlem means \u201cto bloom and flourish\u201d in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. Lemlem is committed to elevating artisanship and expanding production and jobs across Africa. In a quote from Kebede on the brand\u2019s official website: \u201cBy employing traditional weavers, we\u2019re trying to break their cycle of poverty, at the same time preserving the art of weaving while creating modern, casual, comfortable stuff that we really want to wear.\u201d Access to education, health care, fair wages and safe working conditions, and you can get this in exchange for wearing some really cool-looking comfortable clothes? That\u2019s smart shopping.\n\nIn Africa, shea butter is called \u201cwomen\u2019s gold.\u201d Why? Because 16 million women make a living in West Africa picking the nuts that become shea butter. Shea Radiance, founded in 2010 by a Nigerian-American mother on a quest to treat her kids suffering from eczema, embodies the phrase \u201ccharity begins at home.\u201d By taking care of the needs of the few, she created a means to take care of many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy March of 2013, the company website reports, Shea Radiance had trained more than 300 small businesses to \u201cThink Global and Act Local\u201d through a selection of workshops, including soap making, formulation, access to finance, business plan development and marketing.\n\nShea butter is an incredible gift to women on so many levels: from the shea producer in the village to the small-business owner who manufactures products for the local market.\n\nLeila Janah\u2019s mission is \u201cto give work.\u201d As a self-taught skin-care aficionado and founder and CEO of the global poverty-fighting nonprofit Samasource, Janah\u2019s latest venture is LXMI (pronounced \u201cluxe-me\u201d), a skin-care company based on the rare nut butter (and relative of shea) nilotica, which is available on LXMI\u2019s site and QVC and at 300 Sephora locations worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanah first encountered nilotica while visiting Uganda, and immediately saw its potential. With sourcing from the banks of the Nile, and by employing local harvesters and fair-trade practices, this skin-care brand is great not just for your skin but also for your ethical impact, as its website states:\n\nIn fact, we promise that for each of our primary ingredient harvests, our producers earn at least 3x the local average wage. These living wages will help chip away at some of the world\u2019s most serious problems, from childhood malnutrition to human trafficking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobal Goods Partners launched in 2005 as a not-for-profit social enterprise with a commitment to providing sustainable jobs for women. Since that time, it has partnered with women-led, community-based organizations and over 60 artisan groups in more than 20 countries throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas.\n\nIts products are handcrafted by artisans who make a fair living wage for each product they produce, as well as have access to training and funding to sustain their own enterprise. The company has also awarded more than $150,000 in financial grants to its partners around the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoe designer Aurora James is a darling of the business of global luxury fashion accessories, and she did it by helping black women in Africa live and work with dignity. James earned her stripes in the fashion world traveling the globe with her mother, who sourced hard-to-find, unique artisan fashions for wealthy clients in New York, London and Paris.\n\nBrother Vellies\u2014which comes from the South African slang term for a man\u2019s flat shoe, a stock staple of her collection\u2014employs weavers, cobblers and Maribou feather-makers from one end the African continent to the other. James\u2019 commitment to fair-trade practices and using African artisans proves that while most of us don\u2019t know the struggle that our African brothers and sisters face on the daily, we can help change their lives by walking a mile in their shoes.\n\nClothed in Hope\u2019s mission is \u201cto empower women in Zambia through education and economic opportunity.\u201d It does that by helping women create sustainable businesses through offering a yearlong life-skills-training program in sewing and entrepreneurship; development focusing on women\u2019s empowerment; education to vulnerable women in health, disease prevention and nutrition; providing microloans to assist in launching independent, sustainable businesses; and marketing and selling Zambian-designed and -produced accessories and home goods to help women generate income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince its launch in 2012, more than 254 women have joined its life-skills-training program, over 75 have received microloans to start businesses (with a 100 percent repayment rate), and over 888 children have benefited as a result of the empowerment of their mothers.\n\nAble is a lifestyle brand that promises \u201cbeautiful products by women who have overcome.\u201d Its mission is \u201cfocused on ending generational poverty by working with women who have often overcome extraordinary circumstances. [It] manufacture[s] directly in the communities [it] wish[es] to impact, both locally and globally, creating jobs and ending the cycle of charity dependency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding that the fashion industry is the third-largest industrial industry in the world, and that of its 60 million employees, over 75 percent are women, Able began while founder Barrett Ward was visiting Ethiopia and saw the effect of generational poverty on young women, often forced into prostitution to support themselves and their families. Able now prides itself on disrupting that cycle through its empowering and transparent business practices, saying:\n\nWhether your purchase is produced in Ethiopia, Mexico, Peru or at our headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., each item has one thing in common: through working with women, it is leading all of us a step closer to the end of generational poverty. With your help, we are working each day to give opportunity to women in a safe and healthy environment and encouraging our peers to do the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["fashion", "womens", "international", "support", "africa", "drop", "brands", "globally", "african", "mission", "world", "poverty", "day", "working", "women", "shop", "sustainable", "shea"], "polarity": 0.18128485628485627, "subjectivity": 0.40984555984555976},

Considering the long-standing contributions of women and people of color in our society, it\u2019s both lazy and insulting to shoehorn our national recognition into 31-days-or-less pockets. Instead, we like our history like we like our society\u2014fully integrated.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve decided to make this integration literal. We at Jezebel and The Root will use this poor substitute for a proper American-history lesson as an opportunity to talk together about women\u2019s issues. JezeRoot is real for the entire month of March. And it\u2019s here just in time not to tell you, yet again, about Betsy Ross stitching together a flag or to go into typical fare about Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony (who is mad problematic).\n\nInstead, we\u2019re going to spend Women\u2019s History Month talking about the women whom society would like you not to talk about. Society\u2019s so-called bad women. \u201cWomen of ill repute.\u201d Women who not only have had to fight for fair pay and equal treatment, but who also had to fight just to be considered women.\n\nThanks to a patriarchal, racist, white supremacist society hell-bent on keeping all women in their place, full human rights are a luxury that very few women have been afforded, particularly women of color, domestic workers and sex workers. The women in these roles are not just oft forgotten but also represent key facets of our society that are erected, sustained and felt most acutely by women: child care, sexual freedom, civil rights and immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJezeRoot will address and examine the deeply politicized pasts of these underrepresented populations as well as their reality in 2018, and also look ahead at how their identities and challenges could\u2014and arguably should\u2014shape American infrastructure and the legislative landscape.\n\nDomestic workers, sex workers and women of color are not just flash points of women\u2019s history or windows into where many women have been. They represent the way forward\u2014beyond Women\u2019s History Month, Black History Month or the limited structure of any month. An exploration of their subjugation and the paths they have taken will lead us out of our segregated history and into a fully integrated future.", "keywords": ["root", "womens", "sex", "history", "shouldnt", "month", "society", "workers", "talk", "jezeroot", "women", "color", "jezebel"], "polarity": -0.01843005952380952, "subjectivity": 0.4913392857142858},

Do you call yourself a true Beyonc\u00e9 stan? Do you think you know the entire trajectory of the megastar from her being a child of destiny to being Queen of the Beyhive, including the details of her pre-Lemonade cornrow era, the exact shade of her shimmering stage tights and the length of her longest lace front?\n\nIf you are that fan, then perhaps you\u2019ll understand the value of this rare opportunity: Currently up for auction is a collection of circa-1992 videotapes documenting the star\u2019s rise\u2014with appearances from then-bandmates Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett, of course.\n\nTouting two-and-a-half hours of raw, unedited, previously unreleased footage, the collection of 19 Betacam(!) tapes is being auctioned off by English appraisal and auction house Ted Owen & Co at the bargain base price of 750,000 pounds\u2014that\u2019s $1,030,517 U.S.\u2014though the house has estimated the value of these rare gems between 1.5 million and 3 million pounds. And just so you know how much Beyonc\u00e9 a million and change will get you, the auction\u2019s description is as follows:\n\nThe collection is now comprised of 19 videotapes (previously 11) that contain the footage from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two professionally produced music video productions. These videos were never officially released and the footage in the collection used to create them is nearly three hours in length. Included are Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s rehearsals, performances and outtakes that were shot before, during and after an onstage performance with her group Girl\u2019s Tyme at the BMI New Music showcase at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco on Aug. 26, 1992. Also included are scenes shot at the Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, Calif., during the time Beyonc\u00e9 was there to record her first professionally produced and engineered recordings. There is also footage from a third location\u2014a shopping mall\u2014where Beyonc\u00e9 is acting for the camera beside her longtime friend and Destiny\u2019s Child member / Grammy Award Winner LaTavia Roberson. In addition, the collection includes the edited master tapes and work-in-progress tapes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two music video productions. The collection has been locked in storage for more than 20 years and has only been seen by a select few people since being recorded.\n\nIf you\u2019re the Sultan of Brunei-level of Beyonc\u00e9 fan who feels they absolutely must have these pre-Auto-Tune performances in their life, our guess is that you can also afford to track down a Betacam player before the auction ends on March 13.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["venue", "guests", "black", "york", "panther", "welcome", "till", "bnyfw", "stage", "week", "designer", "wakanda"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

Aside from being ready-to-wear, the collection featured decidedly ready-for-work wear, filled with feminine yet businesslike blouses, pencil skirts and trousers in an array of traditionally conservative hues like navy, charcoal gray and burgundy.\n\nDesigned by Atlanta native Amanda Williamson, Ennyluap is a \u201cclassic contemporary clothing label dedicated to timeless style and high quality for women and children.\u201d Williamson debuted Ennyluap at New York Fashion Week in 2013 and, in the years since, has won the Belk Southern Designer Showcase, been presented to former first lady Michelle Obama and named a Forbes 30 Under 30 nominee for Art & Style in 2017.\n\nAs a rare black female designer presenting at New York Fashion Week this season, what Williamson has accomplished shouldn\u2019t be understated simply because her clothes are.

By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["double", "wardrobe", "really", "think", "dj", "dressed", "life", "hyacinthe", "career", "dope", "inside", "sophia", "women", "feel", "night", "fashion", "york"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for. The woman who, no matter what she\u2019s been through, puts on the clothes with her head held high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat beautiful black girls might we expect to see high-stepping on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this season?\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of casting, so no spoilers!\u201d he says. \u201cEach season, we prioritize diversity in our runway casting and do our best to represent the Brandon Maxwell woman: strong, sophisticated and confident.\u201d\n\nYou can trust that The Glow Up will be there to see our beautiful queens serve the people in the next chapter of his fashion fairy tale.", "keywords": ["maxwell", "charm", "maxwells", "video", "model", "love", "campaign", "3rd", "brandon", "believes", "riley", "smalls", "times", "models", "fashion", "designer", "blackgirlmagic"], "polarity": 0.27941388373531234, "subjectivity": 0.556208410636982},

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["chasemarshall", "talent", "missing", "black", "simply", "action", "industry", "designers", "hiring", "fashion", "designer", "problem"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},
