David Ake/AP J. David Ake/AP\n\nUpdated at 3:45 p.m. ET\n\nA conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch is turning its attention to a new front: promoting federal judges at the grass-roots level. Americans for Prosperity is willing to spend nearly $1 million to confirm judges this year. Those lifetime appointments could reshape the courts for a generation.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that so much of what affects us in our daily lives plays out in the courtroom,\" said Sarah Field, the group's new vice president for judicial strategy.\n\nBut even more important than the money could be the firepower AFP wants to engage. The idea is to mobilize conservative activists across 36 states for key confirmation fights this year. That includes people who call their home-state senators, write letters and knock on doors.\n\nFor now, ground zero is in Wisconsin, where AFP state director Eric Bott said it's a little too cold to knock on doors just yet. Bott said his network of 130,000 volunteers has rallied for Tea Party causes, supported Republican Gov. Scott Walker and fought for limits on the state's collective bargaining laws. Now, those volunteers are turning their attention to judges.\n\n\"A lot of our activists are really looking for certain types of jurists,\" he said. \"They want a judge who's going to respect the rule of law. They're looking for a judge who's going to interpret the Constitution as it was originally intended.\"\n\nAFP has already thrown its support behind one of President Trump's judge picks this year \u2014 Michael Brennan, a Milwaukee lawyer and ally of Gov. Walker.\n\nWisconsin's Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, refused to turn in a blue slip for Brennan. The blue slip is a way for senators to signal support for a nominee. Withholding that paperwork usually means the end of a nomination, as Baldwin noted in a letter earlier this year.\n\n\"President Trump's nomination of Mr. Brennan disregards the longstanding, bipartisan process in Wisconsin that has informed the selection of federal judges in my state,\" Baldwin said. \"This is a particularly troubling step at a time when institutions and traditions of democracy seem under constant attack, and bipartisanship feels like a fading concept.\"\n\nBut the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, broke with 100 years of tradition and held a hearing for Brennan anyway. Last month, Brennan advanced out of the committee on a party-line vote of 11 to 10. He's waiting for action by the full Senate.\n\nAFP is buying digital ads to encourage a quick vote.\n\n\"This is a seat that has been vacant longer than any other seat on the federal bench and the people of Wisconsin deserve to see a judge confirmed on the 7th Circuit,\" said Sarah Field of AFP.\n\nKristine Lucius of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that's not the full story. Lucius pointed out that the current nominee, Michael Brennan, wrote an opinion piece supporting Republican efforts to block President Obama's pick for that same job. The delay strategy worked.\n\n\"And to think that that person who defended that right would now enjoy the nomination and be critical of the other senator who is exercising her own rights is the epitome of hypocrisy,\" she added.\n\nLucius now fights against many of Trump's selections for the federal courts. But she said she understands why AFP is stepping up its role.\n\n\"To me it's not surprising that the Koch brothers, billionaire corporate leaders, would want to invest their money in the fight to get judges to uphold their corporate rights,\" Lucius said. \"They think this is money well spent because they are trying to tilt the bench. They are trying not to have rule of law that rules against them, but instead they want to get more people into lifetime positions that will rule in favor of corporate interests over individual interests.\"\n\nJudges confirmed to lifetime posts already represent one of the president's most important accomplishments. And groups on both ends of the political spectrum know that other big fights are on the way.\n\nFrom her headquarters in Virginia, Sarah Field of AFP says she's gearing up.\n\n\"Everything that we're doing is really pointing to the future of the Supreme Court,\" Field said.\n\nUnlike some other conservative groups, AFP intends to make federal judges a focus of its permanent grass-roots efforts.\n\nEditor's note: Koch Industries, though not the Koch brothers' PAC, has been a sponsor of NPR.", "keywords": ["wisconsin", "activists", "judges", "mobilize", "trumps", "afp", "field", "sarah", "judge", "federal", "koch", "conservatives", "promote", "trump", "grassroots", "brennan"], "polarity": 0.11333732057416271, "subjectivity": 0.41753626490468604},

McMaster is expected to depart his White House position soon, U.S. officials tell NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Despite a denial from the Trump administration, the only thing that is reportedly holding up McMaster's departure is a transition plan.\n\nMcMaster's exit has been the subject of rumors, in a similar way that outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been viewed as not long for life under President Trump. Officials say McMaster, 55, could leave within weeks, possibly within a month or so.\n\n\"We don't get a sense of when this will happen,\" Tom says, \"but we're told it will likely happen.\"\n\nInformation about Trump's desire to replace McMaster has been solidified by sources, despite a denial from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who tweeted Thursday night that she had just spoken to Trump and McMaster and that \"contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC [National Security Council].\"\n\n\"Trump has publicly said that he respects H.R. McMaster, but their relationship has not been an easy one,\" Tom tells NPR's Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. \"There were some policy differences: H.R. favored an enduring commitment in Afghanistan, he served there for a time and actually wanted more troops sent over there. Others in the White House disagreed with that.\"\n\nAs for any possible personal rift between Trump and McMaster, Tom says, \"People in the Army say he's 'all transmit,' as they would put it: He likes to lecture. That rubs some people the wrong way \u2014 and the sense is, that rubs Trump the wrong way.\"\n\nSome of McMaster's friends had reportedly advised him not to work for the new president \u2014 Tom cites some of their warnings: \"The president is mercurial, he has no background in military policy, foreign policy \u2014 so it was a tough job for him to take. But ... [McMaster] is very aggressive, has a big ego. I'm sure he thought that he could do a pretty good job here. But clearly, he's on his way out.\"\n\nTrump publicly chastised McMaster last month, after the national security adviser said that \"the evidence is now really incontrovertible\" that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election that put Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nThat statement spurred Trump to tweet, \"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians\" and to deny any collusion.\n\nWhen McMaster accepted the national security adviser job in the Trump administration one year ago, he was stepping into a post that had been vacated by the firing of Michael Flynn, who is also a figure in the Russian investigation. In early 2017, reports cited McMaster's reluctance to take the position \u2014 and when he finally did take the job, McMaster retained his active-duty status as a lieutenant general in the Army.\n\nTom says that he was told that while McMaster's departure is definite, the timing is uncertain \u2014 possibly within a month or two, officials said. But as Tom adds, \"With this White House, with the president tweeting, it could happen today.

It's also coming to an airport near you.\n\nAt Orlando International Airport, Britain-bound passengers \u2014 some wearing Mickey Mouse T-shirts and other Disney paraphernalia \u2014 lined up at Gate 80 recently for the evening British Airways flight to London's Gatwick Airport. It looks like any other airport departure area, except for the two small gates with what look like small boxes on posts next to them. Those boxes are actually cameras.\n\nThey were installed this month by SITA, the Geneva-based company that develops information technology for the world's airlines, in conjunction with British Airways and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP.\n\nSherry Stein, a senior manager at SITA, says the cameras are triggered when passengers step onto designated footprints. \"We collect a photo, send it to CBP, who checks to make sure that person is booked on the manifest and matches the photo that they already have on file.\" If everything matches, Stein says, \"we open the doors and give them the OK to board.\" All that happens, she says, \"in three to five seconds.\"\n\nIf things don't match, the traveler's passport is scanned manually by a gate agent.\n\ntoggle caption Brian Naylor/NPR\n\nCBP is testing biometric scanning at a dozen or so U.S. international airports to ensure that people leaving the country are who they say they are, and to prevent visa overstays. The Transportation Security Administration, another agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is testing similar devices at security check-in lines.\n\nSteve Karoly, acting assistant administrator at TSA, calls the use of biometrics \"a game changer\" for the aviation security. \"It will make things a little bit easier, more efficient at an airport environment,\" he says. Karoly predicts it will be a few more years before biometrics are in widespread use by TSA.\n\nCritics like Harrison Rudolph of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law School say the technology now isn't ready for prime time. Rudolph, co-author of a report released by the center in December, considers the system \"riddled with legal and technical problems.\"\n\nAmong the problems he cites is bias. \"DHS doesn't seem to know whether its system will falsely reject folks,\" that is, be unable to match the face scan with photos it has in the system, at higher rates because of their race or gender. \"That's a serious problem,\" he says.\n\nAccording to a report by the CAPA-Centre for Aviation, face-recognition software \"is not so good at identifying ethnic minorities when most of the subjects used in training the technology were from the majority group.\" Another problem are passengers who are wearing glasses, hats or scarves.\n\nRudolph says about 4 percent of travelers are wrongly rejected by the system.\n\nAnother concern he has: He says privacy protections are nonexistent.\n\n\"DHS hasn't issued a single rule under this program to protect Americans' privacy,\" Rudolph says. \"So what DHS decides to do with this information tomorrow, I'm not sure. And without rules there may be few protections for Americans' privacy.\"\n\nCBP says it deletes the photos taken at airport gates within 14 days. Sean Farrell, director of strategy and innovation at SITA, says travelers seem to be comfortable with the new technology. \"We haven't seen that privacy as being a major concern for passengers,\" Farrell says. \"They seem to actually embrace this technology and are willing to provide a biometric in order to get the benefit of an improved boarding process.\"\n\nMany travelers in Orlando whom NPR spoke with said they were happy with the process, although there was some grumbling by those at the end of the boarding queue.\n\nComfortable or not, travelers should probably get used to the technology.

They arrived as Washington's closest ally, Britain, is locked in a diplomatic struggle with Moscow after accusing the Kremlin of using a nerve agent to poison a former Russian intelligence officer living in the United Kingdom.\n\nTrump also joined the leaders of the U.K., France and Germany on Thursday in issuing a statement that condemned the poisoning attack.\n\nAmong the Russians sanctioned by the U.S. on Thursday are 13 people and three entities, including the Internet Research Agency, indicted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller for their alleged role in Moscow's influence operation during the 2016 campaign.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned whether Russia did indeed interfere in the election, despite the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that the Kremlin carried out a sweeping influence operation and propaganda campaign.\n\nLately, however, he has changed his tune and accepted that the active measures took place. Last week, he vowed to \"counteract very strongly\" any interference in this year's midterm races.\n\nTwo Russian intelligence agencies \u2014 the domestic-focused Federal Security Service, or FSB, and Russia's chief military intelligence organization, the GRU \u2014 also were hit with sanctions along with six senior GRU officials. Several of those individuals already faced U.S. sanctions.\n\nSanctions against the government agencies are mostly symbolic and are not expected to seriously constrain the campaign of active measures against the West.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, however, that the point is to continue pressuring and isolating Russia over its agitation against the West.\n\n\"The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyberactivity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyberattacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,\" Mnuchin said.\n\n\"These targeted sanctions are part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.\"\n\nAmong the cyberattacks for which U.S. is trying to punish Russia was the \"NotPetya\" attack, which targeted computers in Ukraine. The U.S. attributes that attack to the Russian military.\n\nMnuchin said the administration plans to impose more sanctions in an effort \"to hold Russian government officials and oligarchs accountable for their destabilizing activities by severing their access to the U.S. financial system.\"\n\nCritics said the measures announced on Thursday were far too little, too late.\n\n\"It took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain \u2014 but the administration is finally imposing the sanctions overwhelmingly approved by Congress,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\n\n\"However, sanctions alone are insufficient. Now we must protect our democracy going forward by securing our election systems and increasing transparency and disclosure requirements for online political advertisements.\"\n\nAdministration officials say they're doing that. The Department of Homeland Security and FBI are working with state-level elections officials to familiarize them with the cyberthreats from abroad.\n\nBut the potential peril is broader than ever. National security officials told reporters on Thursday that cyberattackers also have focused on American critical infrastructure, including the electrical grid and key industrial facilities.\n\n\"The cyber actors are using a multistage attack campaign with staging and intended targets involved,\" one official said. \"And the campaign is long term and still ongoing.\"\n\nForeign cyberattackers gain access to internal networks involved with running a power plant, for example. Then they map the way it works and burrow deeper.\n\n\"After obtaining access, these actors conducted network reconnaissance, moved laterally and collected information pertaining to industrial control systems, the systems that run our factories and our grid.\"\n\nAn attack that crippled an American electrical system or another major industrial target would probably be viewed as a major act of war and could trigger an equal response.\n\nSo it's not as likely as the lower-level interference that continues from Russia, but it remains part of the suite of weapons that nations could wield against one another in a crisis addition to their traditional military hardware.", "keywords": ["interference", "intelligence", "attack", "administration", "election", "cyberattacks", "russian", "measures", "imposes", "officials", "sanctions", "russia"], "polarity": 0.0161453483623295, "subjectivity": 0.4102299273053989},

Countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe have long complained that Chinese trade practices such as forced transfers of technology, illegal government subsidies and dumping of low-cost exports weaken competitors.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro, a staunch China critic, says, \"I think there's a widespread and growing consensus around the world that China is not playing by the rules and that together we as allies and trading partners need to take many, many different kinds of measures to ensure a level playing field.\"\n\nTrump has been excoriating China for years, accusing it of blocking access to its markets for foreign companies.\n\nOnce in office, he has been slower to match his rhetoric with actions. His administration failed to label China a currency manipulator, even though Trump promised to do so during the campaign.\n\nHe may have hesitated in part because he needed Beijing's help with North Korea, and because the prospect of a trade war scares U.S. companies such as Boeing, which earn a lot of money in China.\n\nBut a clash seems almost inevitable, given China's outsize role in global trade. The U.S. recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The vast increase in production of the two metals by China in recent years has helped lower their price globally and hurt U.S. producers, the U.S. says.\n\n\"If you're concerned about the large U.S. trade deficit, which the president is and has said he is repeatedly, most of that's a China problem,\" says Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn December, the administration released its national security strategy, which for the first time labeled China an \"economic aggressor,\" Navarro noted.\n\nThe paper said, \"We will work with our partners to contest China's unfair trade and economic practices and restrict its acquisition of sensitive technologies.\"\n\nStill, any move to punish China carries risks for the United States and the world as a whole.\n\nThe countries of the world have spent decades carefully crafting laws meant to regulate the flow of trade, notes Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies. Disputes between nations are meant to be settled at the World Trade Organization.\n\nIf the U.S. opts to act on its own, it could undermine the infrastructure of global trade in a way that causes more problems than it solves, Ikenson says.\n\n\"My main concern is that we actually go forward with these unilateral duties, and the rest of the world sees the United States as disavowing the WTO, China retaliates and so the costs start to spread across the U.S. economy,\" he says.\n\nWhile China has sometimes shown it's willing to change some of its more egregious trade practices, it's also made clear it will go at its own pace.\n\nToo much pressure from Washington is likely to be seen as bullying by Beijing and could invite retaliation against U.S. companies.\n\nBut after lobbing so much criticism at China over the years, Trump may feel he has little choice but to take action of some kind.\n\nAs Navarro sees it, such action has been a long time coming.\n\n\"It's staggering \u2014 staggering \u2014 what China does in terms of cheating the international system, and it's refreshing that we finally have a president that is standing up for all the American people and standing up to China on all this,\" he says.", "keywords": ["practices", "prepares", "administration", "trade", "tougher", "china", "tariffs", "navarro", "trump", "president", "world", "foreign"], "polarity": 0.04543109668109668, "subjectivity": 0.4293217893217893},

For instance, the building is covered in windows, but each one is blocked by heavy drapes. And there are security cameras all over the building.\n\nThat's what you can see from the outside. But what went on inside this building in 2015 has attracted a lot of attention in both U.S. and Russian media. The company that operated inside 55 Savushkina was called the Internet Research Agency.

The trolls were divided into groups. Those with the best English skills posed as Americans and created accounts on Facebook and Twitter. They'd use those troll accounts to stir up trouble on subjects such as U.S. elections or race relations.\n\nSavchuk, who considers herself a freelance investigative journalist and activist for free and fair elections, spent most of her time at the troll farm writing as an imaginary Russian woman on the LiveJournal blogging platform, widely used in Russia today. Her posts were meant for Russian readers and were intended to inflame anti-American feelings.\n\n\"We made up a post about a new computer game created in the States \u2014 that even kids loved to play \u2014 and the theme of the game was slavery,\" she says. \"And this was to stir negative tensions towards Americans, as the creators of this game.\"\n\nThat game never existed. Nor did the woman that Savchuk was posing as. A day at the troll factory could mean multiple layers of trolling subterfuge.\n\nEach troll was given a list of topics to focus on by a supervisor. She says there were usually about 10 topics on the list. The United States, the European Union and Putin never left the list.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jolie Myers/NPR Jolie Myers/NPR\n\n\"It is laughable when Putin says that we do not know about trolls or trolls do not exist,\" she says, \"because when anyone looks thorough the Kremlin-controlled newspapers or state TV, they can see that the propaganda in that media is the exact same stuff that the trolls are posting.\"\n\nSavchuk worries about the deleterious effect of so much fake information on Russian society.\n\n\"For the public, it is harmful because we are being brainwashed,\" she says. \"We won't be able to understand what is really happening. We are put against one another, and we are sliding back into the old ways when we were searching for the enemy among us \u2014 our friends and colleagues. That feeling from the Soviet times \u2014 I can feel it everywhere.\"\n\nSavchuk eventually leaked documents, videos and her story to the independent Russian news outlet Moy Rayon in 2015. And then the trolls and state-controlled media came after her.\n\n\"They said that I am a secret agent, a CIA operative, and that I am a pervert,\" she says. \"This is what they usually do. So I was ready for this.\"\n\nShe says she ignored the trolls and hoped that her reporting spoke for itself.\n\nShe says that the charges against the 13 employees of the Internet Research Agency are her answer to those allegations.\n\nSavchuk says she worked with several of the 13 troll factory people named in the Mueller indictment and was elated when she heard that workers and managers at the factory had been indicted.\n\n\"This was really a good sign,\" she says. \"We should continue to add more names to this list. I think that every single propagandist, even the little troll on Facebook, has to be punished, has to be named and exposed.\"\n\nFreelance journalist Anna Shpakova contributed to this story.", "keywords": ["uncovered", "trolls", "savchuk", "jolie", "troll", "building", "probe", "activist", "named", "factory", "worked", "russians", "russian", "media", "meet", "mueller"], "polarity": -0.003477591529917107, "subjectivity": 0.3136155156213295},

In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn't an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries.\n\nAs she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn't clear from Trump's remarks whether that is really what he was talking about.\n\nTrump was in the midst of a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in St. Louis on Wednesday when, according to the Washington Post write-up, he riffed on a conversation he'd had with Trudeau.\n\n\" 'Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, \"No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\" ' Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. 'Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \"Donald, we have no trade deficit.\" He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed. ... \" 'So, he's proud. I said, \"Wrong, Justin, you do.\" I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \"You're wrong.\" You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, \"You're wrong, Justin.\" He said, \"Nope, we have no trade deficit.\" I said, \"Well, in that case, I feel differently,\" I said, \"but I don't believe it.\" I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \"Check, because I can't believe it.\" ' \"\n\nThis caught-on-tape moment comes less than a week after Trump signed proclamations putting stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Those tariffs won't immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.\n\nIt's not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult.\n\nAsked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question.\n\nBut he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, \"P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!\"\n\nCanada is America's second-largest goods trading partner, according to U.S. data. Trade with Canada supported some 1.6 million jobs in the U.S., according to 2015 Commerce Department figures.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Canadian government declined to comment on Trump's remarks and directed NPR to a tweet from the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, who cited the same American figures.\n\nThis is far from the first time Trump has inaccurately described the trade relationship with America's neighbor to the north.\n\nIn a December New York Times interview, Trump claimed that \"[We lost] $17 billion with Canada \u2014 Canada says we broke even. But they don't include lumber and they don't include oil. Oh, that's not. ... [Inaudible] ... My friend Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] he says, 'No, no, we break even.' I said, 'Yeah, but you're not including oil, and you're not including lumber.' When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we're losing $71 billion.\"\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro fact-checked this at the time. It is entirely unclear where Trump got his numbers. In a recent paper, Canada-based researchers said that if energy exports are excluded, the country runs a $78 billion manufacturing trade deficit with the United States.", "keywords": ["admits", "trudeau", "justin", "canada", "guy", "according", "canadian", "trade", "prime", "making", "talks", "minister", "youre", "deficit", "trump"], "polarity": 0.08187487116058545, "subjectivity": 0.5128123067408781},

So Are The Russia Investigations Over?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nThe House intelligence committee has completed its \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" story about the Russia imbroglio. Republicans wrote a happy ending for President Trump. Democrats wrote a cliffhanger.\n\nEven though members of the committee say they're taking separate ramps off this highway, however, the road goes ever on. Here are 4 more mileposts still to come in the remainder of the Russia imbroglio.\n\n1. The House intelligence committee's final report\n\nDemocrats are already unhappy with it, but the leaders of the House intelligence committee say their report is complete. It could land with a thud: It's more than 150 pages, includes more than 40 findings and makes 25 recommendations.\n\nFor now, though, it's still secret. First, Democrats in the committee's minority need to \"review\" it \u2014 although they've already made clear how they feel \u2014 and then it must be declassified by the intelligence community before it can become public.\n\nWill it include any new information? The House committee's dueling Republican and Democratic memoranda in February both shed new factual light on the Russia story, even though they were both partisan documents.\n\nRepublicans' memo focused heavily on the facts involved with what they call abuse of power by the FBI and Justice Department, revealing, for example, that the author of the infamous, unverified Russia dossier was a Never-Trumper.\n\nDemocrats countered in their memo by revealing that some of the dossier was, in fact, verified by the FBI, and that more people in the Trump camp were under investigation than previously known \u2014 though all those details remain secret.\n\nWill the chairman of the House intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, R-Calif., break more new ground in his report or simply make an argument exonerating Trump based on what's already public?\n\nThe Senate intelligence committee and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, however, aren't quitting yet \u2014 of which more below. So Nunes' strategy boils down to a bet on time: He has cleared Trump, but how many revelations could still be coming that he doesn't know he doesn't know about?\n\nOne basic point of contention between Republicans and Democrats is over interpreting the facts in the Russia case. Republicans say, in effect, nothing in evidence today shows that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government's attack on the 2016 election or did anything wrong.\n\nContacts that took place between Trump aides and Russians before and after Election Day showed, at worst, bad judgment by the Americans involved, said Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, \u2014 not an international conspiracy.\n\nDemocrats argue that's not only not so \u2014 they believe the evidence does show collusion \u2014 but that Republicans won't do the kind of investigation that would uncover new facts they don't want. House intelligence committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., listed several witnesses he said the Republican majority wouldn't interview, the subpoenas it won't issue and the documents it won't use its power to obtain.\n\nRepublicans, in short, want to fight on the political battlefield in its present condition, build a firebreak and then move on to what they call the next phase of the story: safeguarding future elections.\n\nThat was the line House Speaker Paul Ryan's office took after Nunes' announcement:\n\n\"After more than a year investigating Russia's actions in the 2016 election, we are well into the primary season for the 2018 elections and experts are warning that we need to safeguard against further interference,\" said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. \"That's what this next phase is about and we hope Democrats will join us in seeing this through.\"\n\n2. The Senate intelligence committee's report\n\nHouse intelligence committee Republicans' decision to wrap up their Russia investigation puts subtle pressure on their colleagues in the other chamber. The relationship between the two committees is, if not broken, badly damaged after complaints of leaks and counter-leaks about their work on the Russia case.\n\nNow Republicans on the House side of the Capitol are in a position to say: We've done our work. What's taking you so long?\n\nSenate intelligence committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., has tried to keep his panel inside the guardrails and his working relationship cordial with Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., \u2014 a mirror image of the partisan corrosion on the House side.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBut they still have letters after their names and contrasting incentives in the same way every member of Congress does. Navigating those dynamics is just as fraught, although it plays out in a more senatorial and clandestine fashion.\n\n\"I have said publicly \u2014 and been criticized for it \u2014 that our committee was created to operate in secrecy,\" Burr said last month. \"I believe that's where we perform our best work.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the Senate committee's internal workings have questioned whether it will be able to conclude its work with a single report, or whether its work product might also fission apart in the way the House intelligence committee has.\n\nThat may depend on how different its findings are from the House and whether its slower and more bipartisan approach yields facts that could change the political state of play that Nunes and his compatriots have embraced.\n\n3. The administration's studies\n\nFacets of the executive branch are also at work on studies about the Russian attack on the 2016 election and how to defend the electoral system this year and beyond:\n\nWhat isn't clear is what will ultimately issue from all this work. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have already begun working with state elections officials about cyber-threats and security. Will there be a major new official report from within the Trump administration, or perhaps more than one?\n\nIf Nunes' vision of the Russia story is correct, all the evidence that exists is all there will be. That may mean Trump and his advisers feel more confident about discussing the general issue of election interference \u2014 and that could bring about another new phase in the Russia story.\n\nThere have already been some indications that a page has turned, as when Trump said last week that he isn't concerned about Russian influence on the 2018 midterms.\n\n\"We'll counteract whatever they do,\" the president said. \"We'll counteract it very strongly.\"\n\n4. More action by the special counsel's office?\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is the joker in this pack. No one truly knows what's up his sleeve except him and his team. So far he has charged a number of Americans and Russians \u2014 or concluded guilty pleas about lying to the FBI \u2014 but accused no Trump aides with conspiring directly with the Russian interference.\n\nIf that stands, it'll be a boost for the White House many times greater than the one it got from House intelligence committee Republicans this week.\n\nIf it changes and people within the Trump orbit do face indictment over alleged conspiracy with the active measures, the work of Nunes and his colleagues this week would be badly undercut.", "keywords": ["nunes", "work", "investigations", "trump", "committee", "committees", "election", "republicans", "cleared", "intelligence", "russia", "house", "intel"], "polarity": 0.09252854633289419, "subjectivity": 0.4470765496580714},

When I arrived it was just after dark and I noticed few signs of life as I drove past the scattered homes, scanning for disheartened crossers. In the center of the village a small adobe church stood in an empty dirt lot, and I saw that the front door had been left ajar. I parked the van and left the headlights shining on the entrance. I walked to the heavy wooden door and leaned with all my weight to push it open, causing a loud and violent scraping to rise up and echo into the dim interior.\n\nInside the church, the light from my flashlight glinted off tiny strings of tinsel hanging from the ceiling. A large piece of fabric depicting the Virgin of Guadalupe was strung across the front wall, and beneath it I saw two figures lying on a blanket that had been spread out between the pews and the altar. As I approached, a man looked up at me and squinted, holding out his hand to block the light. We were resting a little, he said. It's just that we are lost, muy desanimados. A woman huddled close to him, hiding her face. The man propped himself up on one elbow and told me that they had crossed four days ago, that their guide had left them behind on the first night when they'd failed to keep pace with the group. They were lost for days, he said, with nothing to drink but the filthy water from cattle tanks. Puede ser muy fea la frontera, I told him. The man shook his head. Pues s\u00ed, he replied, pero es a\u00fan m\u00e1s feo donde nosotros vivimos.\n\nThe man told me that they came from Morelos. My wife and I, we're just coming to find work, he said. He rubbed his eyes in silence. I have fresh water for you, I told them. At the station there's juice and crackers. The man looked at me and smiled weakly, then asked for a minute to gather their belongings. He stuffed some things into a backpack, then helped his wife to her feet. Her face was streaked with dried tears, and when she turned toward me I saw that she was pregnant. How many months are you? I asked. The woman looked away and the man answered for her. Seis meses. He smiled. My wife speaks perfect English, he said, shouldering the backpack. He stopped in front of the altar, bowing his head and making the sign of the cross. I waited at the door as he mumbled a prayer. Gracias, he whispered. Gracias.\n\nOutside I looked at their faces in the glare of my headlights. The woman seemed young. Where did you learn English? I asked. Iowa, she told me quietly. I grew up there, she said, I even got my GED. She kept her head down and avoided my gaze as she talked, glancing up only briefly at my uniformed body. Why did you leave? I asked her. She told me that she had returned to Morelos to care for her younger siblings after their mother died. In Morelos I made some money teaching English at the kindergarten, she said, I even tutored the adults in my village, people preparing for the journey north. For a few seconds she seemed proud, and then she shook her head. But the money there, it isn't enough. She glanced up at her husband. It was my idea to cross, she said. I wanted our child to have a life here, like I did.\n\nThe man took a moment to look at me in the light. Listen, he said, do you think you could bring us back to Mexico, como hermano? You could drive us down to the border, he pleaded, you could just leave us there, all\u00ed en la l\u00ednea. Like a brother. I sighed and turned my head, squinting at the darkness beyond the church. I have to bring you in, I told him. It's my job. The man took a deep breath and nodded and then climbed into the back of the transport van, holding out his arms to help his pregnant wife.\n\nI gestured at a case of water bottles on the floor. You should drink, I told them. I grabbed the metal door of the cage and paused. What are your names? I asked. The man looked at me strangely and glanced at his wife. Then, as if it were nothing, they took turns introducing themselves. I repeated their names and I told them mine. Mucho gusto, I said. They replied with polite smiles. Igualmente. I turned my head and then bolted the cage and shut the door.\n\nIn the driver's seat I turned to look at the couple through the plexiglass. The man held his wife and gently whispered to her, cradling her head. Just before I started the engine I could hear the soft sound of her sobbing. As I drove through the unmarked streets of the village, trying to find my way to the highway, I felt for a moment that I had become lost. Beyond the last house, I saw a white dog in the darkness at the edge of my headlights, staring into the night.\n\nAt the station, I sorted through their things with them, discarding perishables and sharp objects. I had them remove their belts and their shoelaces and I tagged their backpacks and handed them a claim ticket. I counted and took note of their money, in pesos and in dollars, and then handed it back to them, telling them to keep it close. Inside the processing center I filled out their voluntary return papers and entered their names into the computer. Before leaving them in their cell I wished them luck on their journey and asked them to be safe, to always think of their child.\n\nLater that night, as I sat in the transport van listening to the calls come out over the radio, I realized I had forgotten their names.", "keywords": ["wife", "looked", "line", "asked", "told", "river", "head", "turned", "man", "took", "village", "van"], "polarity": 0.03761123136123136, "subjectivity": 0.3734547859547859},

Special Election. Here's What It Means\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:50 p.m. ET\n\nDemocrat Conor Lamb appears to have won the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, defeating Republican Rick Saccone in an upset for President Trump and congressional Republicans, based on a review of the vote by member station WESA and barring a recount.\n\nThat a Democrat is even close in this Western Pennsylvania congressional district can mean only one thing \u2014 bad news for Republicans in this midterm year.\n\n\"We should be able to elect a box of hammers in this district,\" veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told the Washington Post's Robert Costa. \"If we're losing here, you can bet there is a Democratic wave coming.\"\n\nWhy the alarm bells?\n\nConsider: Not only is this a district President Trump won by about 20 points in November 2016, as plenty have pointed out, but there are 118 Republicans sitting in seats Trump won by less than the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania. Democrats need to flip a net of 24 seats to take back control of the House.\n\nIt's important to not overread the results of any special election, but the result \u2014 no matter which way it goes in the end \u2014 raises questions about the Trump coalition and how much it transfers to the Republican Party broadly; the GOP's messaging on everything from continuing to use House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a cudgel to the tax bill; and whether Republicans can hold off a Democratic wave given that this result was yet another example of Democrats' holding on to the enthusiasm advantage.\n\nWhere the race goes from here\n\nMember station WESA has reviewed current vote counts from all of the individual counties in the district. That count shows Lamb with a lead of 627 votes. Between provisional ballots, absentee ballots and military/residents overseas ballots still outstanding, there are only 618 votes left to count based on the latest numbers. That gives Lamb an insurmountable lead.\n\nThis is barring the potential for a protest recount, which would be based on evidence of voter fraud or errors in counting. Pennsylvania law does not provide for an automatic recount in congressional races.\n\nThere is no timeline for certification of the race at this point, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office.\n\nA recount is an outside possibility at this point. One would be triggered if three people in each precinct come forward with evidence of voter fraud or counting errors. Loosely, they have until the middle of next week to do that.\n\nWarning signs for GOP that the Trump coalition may not be transferable\n\nWhite, working-class voters were key to Trump's presidential victory \u2014 and there are plenty of them in this district.\n\nTrump won whites with some or no college education by 39 points, a wider margin than any candidate since at least 1980.\n\nThere are no exit polls to know for sure how this group voted Tuesday, but Lamb made clear appeals to them \u2014 and it would be impossible to make up a 20-point gap without at least some crossover. In fact, dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 election.\n\nLamb also benefited from Saccone's history of supporting \"right to work\" legislation in the state Legislature. The district has a sizable number of union households that might have been willing to support a different Republican candidate, but unions and the Lamb campaign were able to define Saccone as anti-union.\n\nAlso, turnout was pretty high, especially for a special election in March. It was so high, in fact, more people voted than in the gubernatorial general election during the last midterm in 2014.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Swensen/Getty Images Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n\nWhat's more, the approximately 228,000 people who went to the polls were 78 percent of the approximately 294,000 cast for Republican Rep. Tim Murphy. Murphy ran unopposed in 2016 but resigned last October amid a sex scandal, which set this special election in motion.\n\nRepublicans spent some $10 million to try to hold this district (that won't even exist in nine months because of the maps' being redrawn by the state Supreme Court) and turn out their voters. But despite the relatively high turnout, Saccone got only about 113,000 votes (the same as Lamb) \u2014 less than 40 percent of Murphy's total in 2016.\n\nTrump made an eleventh-hour visit this past weekend to try to help Saccone over the line.\n\n\"I think the president helped close this race,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan contended Wednesday, per NPR's Susan Davis.\n\nBut that does not appear to have been enough.\n\nThe Pelosi factor and the tax bill messaging\n\nDoes this win for Democrats mean they will start to abandon Pelosi? It very well might, but it depends on the district. A couple of things to look at:\n\nRepublicans seemed to abandon talk of the tax bill, something Democrats point to as the weakness of its message. (One moderate Democratic member of Congress, though, told NPR last week he thinks it's been Democrats who have struggled with how to speak out against the tax bill, as some people see higher paychecks.)\n\nRepublicans also hit Lamb hard, trying to tie him to Pelosi. But it didn't work this time. Lamb cut a conservative Democratic figure and distanced himself from the minority leader.\n\nTo which Ryan had this to say: \"This is something that you're not going to see repeated, because they [Democrats] didn't have a primary. They were able to pick a candidate who could run as a conservative, who ran against the minority leader, who ran on a conservative agenda. You will have primaries in all these other races, and the primaries bring them to the left. So I just don't think this is something they're going to be able to see a repeat of.\"\n\nBut it provides a road map for Democrats in these very kinds of districts if they want to win. That has to be worrying for Republicans.\n\nIt also does raise the question of what Democrats do about Pelosi. If they win the House back in large measure by running against Pelosi, can they really then turn around and re-elect her speaker this fall? And there's the question of whether enough Democratic candidates will vow not to support her for speaker that she can't get elected.\n\nThe suburbs and making inroads in rural areas\n\nFifty-two percent of Lamb's vote came from the suburban precincts in Allegheny County outside Pittsburgh.\n\nIf Democrats are going to win back the House, their road goes through the suburbs. Nationally, in 2016, Trump won the suburbs with 49 percent. In 2012, Mitt Romney got 50 percent in them. So that's key.\n\nLamb won only a handful of precincts in the other three more rural counties in this district, but dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 presidential election for Trump.\n\nIn other words, Lamb was able to cut into Republican margins \u2014 and when every vote counts, as in a race like this, it can make all the difference.\n\nNPR's Arnie Seipel contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["democratic", "pelosi", "pa", "conor", "democrats", "won", "means", "special", "election", "heres", "democrat", "district", "appears", "lamb", "trump", "republican"], "polarity": 0.11978323980983555, "subjectivity": 0.4591707258462578},

Conor's been to every fish fry, every VFW, every American Legion, senior center, doors,\" Fitzgerald told NPR's Scott Detrow. \"He's been relating to people. And that's really what it takes for Democrats to get away from just urban areas and get out into the smaller towns and compete.\"\n\nAnd compete he did.\n\nLamb is the apparent winner of the contest for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, according to an analysis by public radio station WESA. The race has not been officially called, but a review of the votes indicates that Lamb has an insurmountable lead over Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone.\n\nLamb's victory would be a huge win for Democrats, and a major blow to President Trump.\n\nTrump won this district by 20 points in 2016, and Republican Tim Murphy \u2014 who resigned in October after a report that he had encouraged a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion \u2014 won his last eight elections easily.\n\nBut Lamb seems to have overcome that Republican advantage in this largely white, working-class district by touting his bio \u2014 a Marine Corps veteran, former prosecutor, Catholic; and his more conservative positions \u2014 on guns, abortion, crime.\n\nHis first TV ad highlights the fact that he grew up in the district. In the same town, in fact, where he now lives \u2014 Mount Lebanon, a suburb south of Pittsburgh.\n\nConor Lamb via YouTube\n\nHe graduated from Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 2002, earned both his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Pennsylvania, and worked as a prosecutor in the Marine Corps \u2014 first in Okinawa, Japan, and then for the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\nAfter leaving active duty in 2013 and joining the Reserves, Lamb was appointed an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh. There, his bio says, he \"led prosecutions against drug dealers and violent criminals and helped establish the Justice Department's Pittsburgh office as a national leader in the fight against the heroin epidemic, working to build partnerships between law enforcement and community members in places that have been hit hardest by the crisis.\"\n\nLamb stepped down from the U.S. Attorney's Office last fall, shortly after Murphy resigned his seat.\n\nThough this is his first run for office, Lamb comes from a family that has been active in state and local politics. His uncle is Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb; and his grandfather Thomas Lamb was a state representative, the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate in the 1970s and secretary of legislative affairs for Gov. Robert Casey.\n\nUnlike his Republican opponent \u2014 who billed himself as \"Trump before Trump was Trump\" \u2014 Lamb stayed away from making the race about the president or partisan politics.\n\n\"The biggest issues facing the 18th Congressional District aren't partisan,\" his campaign website reads. \"Heroin kills both Democrats and Republicans. Health care is too expensive. The roads and bridges we all use are crumbling. But the people we send to Washington aren't solving these problems. I'm running for Congress because it's time for that to change.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lamb highlighted his work fighting the opioid crisis \u2014 which has hit the region hard \u2014 as well as his support for unions. In a district with 86,000 union households, union endorsement was key to his success.\n\nAt a rally Sunday night, United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts came out hard for Lamb, calling him \"a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, Social Security-believing, health care-creating and sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat.\"\n\nIf certified as the winner, Lamb will serve out the rest of the year in the House, representing PA-18. But the district as it is now will cease to exist at the end of the year because of court-ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania. So if Lamb wants to stay in the House after 2018, he will have to run again \u2014 in a district that is likely to look different from the one he just won.\n\nSamantha Fields is the producer of the NPR Politics Podcast.", "keywords": ["winner", "pittsburgh", "conor", "state", "president", "special", "election", "district", "run", "lamb", "prosecutor", "republican", "trump", "pennsylvania", "apparent"], "polarity": 0.046434481594056096, "subjectivity": 0.358340087808173},

But not even the combined talents of the secretaries of Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy seemed enough to move the ball on the $1.5 trillion plan, and it remains unclear whether the measure will ever find its way to a vote in the House or Senate.\n\nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman John Thune, R-S.D., said he was hopeful that \"both sides can come together on this and it can happen this year.\"\n\nBut several unanswered questions remain, chief among them where the $200 billion in federal funding would come from and where states would find the remainder of the money.\n\nThe Trump plan commits $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. Half of the funding, $100 billion, would be used as incentives to entice cities, counties and states to raise at least 80 percent of the infrastructure costs themselves.\n\nThat's a departure from the way many projects are funded now. Funding for federal-aid highways, including interstates, is usually allocated in an 80-20 federal-state split. So, President Trump's plan would flip that funding burden. Major mass transit projects are often funded on a 50-50 federal-local basis. Again, the administration's plan puts a much greater burden on local taxpayers and users.\n\nEstimates vary but the American Society of Civil Engineers has opined that there is a $2 trillion investment gap when it comes to the country's infrastructure needs.\n\n\"How are you gonna get members of the Senate to vote for the tax revenue in order to pay for these plans?,\" asked Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the ranking Democrat on the panel. \"We can't toll our way out,\" he said. Nelson suggested that the recently-enacted tax cut be changed from a 21-percent corporate rate to 25 percent to pay for infrastructure, a non-starter as far as most Republicans are concerned.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that with some estimates as high as $4 trillion to repair the nation's roads, bridges, ports and airports, \"We cannot address a challenge of this magnitude with federal resources alone, or by borrowing.\" She said the administration was \"agnostic\" about where the state share of the funds would come from, but said the federal government only owns 10 percent of the nation's roads and bridges, implying it was up to state and local governments to figure out where to find the funds to finance their share of improvements.\n\nSeveral states have already raised their gas taxes to fund road repairs, and others have instituted new tolls.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said Congress and the administration have \"got the identification of the problem down cold,\" adding the challenge is \"how we're going to pay for it.\" The administration's plan, he said was \"just smoke and mirrors.\"\n\nAddressing criticism that the administration only released an outline of what it hopes to see in an infrastructure plan, Chao said the administration sent Congress a list of principles rather than specific legislation in \"an open show of cooperation.\" She said the administration wants to work with Congress \"and not be prescriptive\" with specific legislative language.\n\nOne of the key principles for the administration, said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, was removing regulatory barriers to speed approval of construction projects. Perry called the current permitting process fractured and redundant, saying \"it requires projects to navigate a huge maze of federal regulations.\" Perry said Trump wants to see the process streamlined and \"substantially cut back.\"\n\nWednesday morning, the president tweeted thanking the Senate committee for helping with his effort to improve the nation's infrastructure. The president wrote that the nation's infrastructure was \"crumbling,\" and said \"We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE.\"", "keywords": ["cabinet", "trillion", "secretaries", "infrastructure", "way", "plan", "administration", "push", "nations", "congress", "federal", "funding", "projects", "trump"], "polarity": 0.03296226150392817, "subjectivity": 0.37083613916947245},

It was 6:15, and LBJ was only in the sixth full day of his presidency. \"Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor,\" he began. \"All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget. We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been, but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be, what is to be for America, for the world, for the cause we lead, for all the hopes that live in our hearts.\" Reading with deliberate care from a prepared text, the president acknowledged what was surely on every American's mind: \"A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on. Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose.\"\n\nThe day before, LBJ had delivered his first speech before a joint session of Congress-a solemn and widely acclaimed address in which the new president pledged to pick up the mantle from John F. Kennedy and secure passage of the New Frontier's sweeping but stalled policy agenda, including a major tax cut that Kennedy's advisers believed would stimulate the economy; aid to primary and secondary education; and hospital care for seniors. Dozens of LBJ's former colleagues from Dixie sat in stone-cold silence as Johnson affirmed to stirring applause that \"no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law.\"\n\nNow, on Thanksgiving, Johnson doubled down, asking his countrymen to join him in prayer \"for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skins\u2014for God made all of us, not some of us, in His image. All of us, not just some of us, are His children.\"\n\nFor most Americans, Thanksgiving week marked the start of the holiday season. For Lyndon Johnson, it signaled the beginning of an intense, yearlong sprint to prove that he could break the logjam, achieve the New Frontier, and surpass it beyond even the wildest expectations of John Kennedy's supporters. It would be no easy lift.\n\n\"I think the Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was there in the Congress,\" Kennedy remarked roughly a year before his death. For well over two decades, a coalition of conservative southern Democrats and northern Republicans had stymied the expansion of domestic policies first established during the New Deal era. In the Senate, an institution that the journalist William White once dubbed \"the South's unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg,\" conservatives made frequent use of the filibuster to prevent social welfare and civil rights legislation from coming to a vote, while in the House powerful southerners kept such measures forever bottled up in committee. Now, in a sharp rebuke to Kennedy's promise of dynamic action and national rejuvenation, the conservative coalition had all but ground the government to a halt. Not only did the House and the Senate refuse to take up key New Frontier measures. They also refused to pass eight of twelve routine appropriations bills, thus leaving whole parts of the government unfunded and operating on a continuing resolution that set spending at the previous year's levels.\n\nCongressional Quarterly deemed the state of affairs \"unprecedented,\" while Walter Lippmann, the dean of American journalism, bemoaned the \"scandal of drift and inefficiency\" that had beset Washington. \"This Congress has gone further than any other within memory to replace debate and decision by delay and stultification. This is one of those moments when there is reason to wonder whether the congressional system as it now operates is not a grave danger to the Republic.\" Yet as Harry Truman famously asserted, the buck stopped with the president. A week before Kennedy's assassination, the columnist James Reston noted \"a vague feeling of doubt and disappointment about President Kennedy's first term. . . . He has touched the intellect of the country, but not its heart. He has informed but not inspired the nation. He is the most popular figure, but he has been lucky in his competition. . . . [H]is problem is probably not how to get elected but how to govern.\"\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when Lyndon Johnson entered the White House.\n\nLBJ first came to Washington as a young congressional staff member in the early 1930s before returning to Texas in 1935 to serve as state director of the National Youth Administration (NYA), a marquee New Deal jobs project. Two years later, and against all odds, he won a special election to Congress at age twenty-eight. An ardent supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson established a more liberal voting record than most southern Democrats with whom he served in the House. Though he consistently opposed legislation to abolish the poll tax and to make lynching a federal crime, he joined northern Democrats in supporting expanded rights for organized labor, greater administrative oversight of business and industry, and funding for public works. Notably, he continued to do so long after most of his southern Democratic colleagues forged an informal alliance with northern Republicans to oppose the Roosevelt administration. On the strength of his New Deal credentials, FDR strongly backed Johnson in a special election to fill an unexpired Senate seat in 1941. LBJ most likely won the primary (in Texas, as throughout the South, the only vote that mattered), but party rivals stole it from him in a brazen display of election-night ballot fraud. Though in the coming years he aligned himself more closely with his state's oil and gas interests, when he ran a second time for the Senate in 1948, Johnson was once again recognized as the liberal option. After achieving a razor-thin primary victory over the conservative former governor Coke Stevenson-this time, it was likely LBJs allies who stole the election-Johnson drifted rightward during his two terms in the Senate, in part out of recognition that Texas was moving strongly in that direction and in part to curry favor with the chamber's powerful southern chairmen, most notably Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia. Johnson delivered his maiden floor speech in opposition to civil rights, turned against former New Deal allies who now stood accused of communist loyalty, and, in his time as Democratic leader after 1953, cooperated closely with the Eisenhower administration. Many of the liberals in his caucus came to despise LBJ, particularly after he neutered their civil rights bill in 1957. They correctly perceived that he wanted to pass a weak bill in order to make his prospective presidential candidacy in 1960 palatable to northern Democrats but unobjectionable to his fellow southerners. On the day that he assumed office, very few people knew what to make of Lyndon Johnson. Was he simply a pragmatist who, deep in his heart, remained an ardent New Dealer? Or was he a southern conservative who would betray John Kennedy's unfinished legacy?\n\nIf Johnson's belief system was a matter of wide speculation, few observers doubted his keen understanding of Congress. LBJ knew that conservative Democrats, in loose cooperation with Republicans, had willfully manufactured a bottleneck of important legislation to form a bulwark against Kennedy's civil rights bill. Only when liberals capitulated and withdrew the Civil Rights Act would southern Democrats consent to bring Kennedy's tax stimulus to a vote and fund the many government initiatives-including bridges, highways, post offices, and defense projects-that their more liberal and moderate colleagues hoped to deliver to hometown constituents. Johnson knew the playbook because, as a freshman senator, he had helped to write it. As long as conservatives could hold the government hostage, much as they had in 1949, when they successfully fought back Harry Truman's civil rights agenda, they could forestall consideration of Kennedy's New Frontier agenda, including civil rights legislation that lay dying on the Hill.\n\nIt took LBJ less than a day to spring into action. In a series of phone calls before and after Thanksgiving 1963, the new president highlighted the imperative of using his political capital to clear the logjam; then, and only then, would members of Congress feel at liberty to bring civil rights and other New Frontier measures to a vote. In the meantime, however, he would keep up the pressure. On Saturday, November 30\u2014just over a week after assuming the presidency\u2014LBJ asked the former Treasury secretary Robert Anderson, a Republican and outspoken fiscal conservative, to intervene with Howard Smith, the chairman of the Rules Committee, which had broad authority to prevent legislation from proceeding to the House floor. Johnson reminded Anderson that \"this country is not in any condition to take that kind of stuff . . . and that's going to hurt our people. And it's going to hurt the conservatives.\" Anderson agreed to speak with Smith and to convey the president's willingness to support a seldom-used measure\u2014a discharge petition\u2014to bypass Smith's committee altogether and bring the legislation directly to the full House.\n\nPlaying the other side just as artfully, Johnson placed a call to Dave McDonald, the president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and a member in good standing of the liberal coalition. \"They've got to petition it out,\" the president instructed. \"That means we got to get 219. We'll start at about 150 Democrats; that means we got to get 60, 70 Republicans.\" The president spoke with the passion of a true believer (\"we've been talking about this for 100 years. And they won't give us a hearing on this thing, so we got to do something about it\") and implored McDonald to fire up his union's formidable lobbying operation\u2014not only to support the discharge petition in the House, but also to move the tax and appropriations bills through committee.\n\nBefore and after the Thanksgiving holiday, Johnson repeated these conversations time and again, at once lining up support for a discharge petition in the House while affirming the need to clear the logjam of tax and spending bills before making a final push on civil rights in the Senate. Among those who understood the president's strategy was Senator George Smathers, a conservative Democrat from Florida who ultimately opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but who represented a faction of the southern caucus that was disinclined to grind all government to a halt indefinitely over civil rights. The \"sooner we can get a civil rights bill over with,\" he told Johnson, \"get that part of it ended and out of the way, the better off the South's going to be, and the better off the North's going to be, and the better off everybody's going to be. And they wouldn't hide behind the tax bill\u2014and hide behind a lot of other bills, just on the pretense of being against them when the real fact is they're against the civil rights bill.\"\n\nWithout prompting\u2014and without the knowledge that LBJ had been making a similar case to his economic advisers for several days\u2014Smathers suggested that the president make a concerted effort to woo Harry F. Byrd, the deeply conservative chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. If Johnson were willing to indulge Byrd's obsession with fiscal discipline and bring the 1964-1965 federal budget under $100 billion, then the chairman might allow the tax cut to clear through his committee. \"Wish you'd feel Byrd out,\" LBJ agreed, \"and give me a pretty good, full report.\" Unknowingly, George Smathers would help set in motion a chain of events whose consequences would be far reaching.\n\nThe strategy that Lyndon Johnson developed in the first week of his presidency had a profound but highly calculated effect. The pressure that his supporters placed on Howard Smith\u2014and the chairman's realization that a discharge petition, if successful, would permanently undermine his authority\u2014persuaded the cantankerous Virginian to allow the Civil Rights Act to reach the House floor. Beginning with outreach from Smathers, LBJ simultaneously courted Harry Byrd until the patrician senator effectively agreed to swap budget cuts for a tax stimulus. With major economic legislation now cleared through Congress, the president had paved the way for passage of long-awaited civil rights legislation.\n\nJust before the Thanksgiving holiday, some of Johnson's advisers cautioned him that presidents should not spend valuable capital on hopeless causes. \"Well,\" he purportedly replied, \"what the hell's the presidency for?\"\n\nLBJ ultimately brought his budget under $100 billion, pushed Kennedy's tax cut through Congress, and secured passage of the Civil Rights Act-all by late June 1964. He accomplished these measures while also declaring an \"unconditional war on poverty\" and creating the blueprint for the Great Society\u2014the most ambitious domestic agenda since the New Deal. Though LBJ's early success owed in part to his mastery of legislative strategy, equally fundamental were efforts by advocacy groups-religious and lay alike-on behalf of civil rights and social justice legislation. Above all, Johnson benefited from a deep well of public support in the wake of Kennedy's assassination. The president's approval ratings, which fluctuated between 70 percent and 77 percent throughout the spring, owed at least as much to the country's determination to lock arms with its new leader as to LBJ's policy and political triumphs.\n\nUnlike most of his predecessors, LBJ did not enjoy the benefit of a transition period to build the team that would help him, in turn, build his vision. Instead, he had little choice but to improvise on the spot\u2014to pull a trusted friend like Jack Valenti along with him to the White House or entreat old hands from his House and Senate days to join him on a new and unfamiliar journey. These handicaps notwithstanding, in that first year of seemingly unrestrained activity and accomplishment\u2014from the time of Kennedy's death to his own election to the presidency in late 1964\u2014Johnson assembled an ad hoc staff that defied the expectations of even the most cynical Washington hands. They were a \"coalition government\" of Kennedy and Johnson men\u2014a \"strange amalgam of Austin and Boston, of cool, brainy Easterners and shrewd, folksy Texans, of men who had always been fiercely loyal to him and men who had fought and belittled him before the 1960 Los Angeles Democratic convention,\" according to Charles Roberts, who covered the White House for Newsweek. \"It is some kind of tribute to Isaiah and the LBJ Way that the transition went as smoothly as it did.\"", "keywords": ["building", "legislation", "tax", "senate", "civil", "kennedys", "society", "rights", "great", "house", "johnson", "lbj", "president"], "polarity": 0.15173983379725015, "subjectivity": 0.46541957112531274},

He largely supports the president's agenda and has been a big advocate of his tax cuts.\n\n\"Trump and the GOP are on the side of the growth angels with the passage of powerful tax-cut legislation to boost business investment, wages, and take-home family pay,\" Kudlow wrote after the Republican tax bill passed in December.\n\nBut he has criticized Trump's trade policies. For example, he recently said any move to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement would be a \"calamitously bad decision.\"\n\nLike Cohn, he also opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs announced earlier this month, telling CNBC: \"In the Reagan years, we used to call the free traders the 'white hats' and the protectionists the 'black hats.' The black hats won this time around and I'm very sorry, because it will damage the economy to some extent.\"\n\nKudlow told The Wall Street Journal he had voiced his concerns to the president and was encouraged by Trump's decision to exempt Canada, Mexico and Australia from the tariffs.\n\n\"He said to me several times, 'I believe in global trade. I regard myself as a global trader, but it has to be fair trade to protect America,' \" Kudlow told the Journal. \"I'm on board with that. I personally hope widespread tariff use \u2014 it doesn't come to that. But in some cases, it will.\"\n\nOn his recent podcast, Kudlow noted: \"Mr. Trump has a negotiating style that is very interesting to me. He comes at you \u2014 like he's going to punch you in the teeth with all these tariffs. But then he pulls back and starts making, you know, negotiating deals that can work. That looks to me like, you know, that's his art of the deal. It's in his book. That looks to me like what he's doing here on tariffs. He comes out really hard and strong. Scares everybody. But then he starts to pull back and withdraw.\"\n\nKudlow does not have an economics degree. After serving in the White House Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, he was hired as chief economist at Bear Stearns. But he was forced out amid struggles with drug use, a problem he has spoken about publicly.\n\nSince then he has been a regular commentator and host on CNBC and has written often on economic matters. But he was criticized for repeatedly downplaying the economy's troubles in the months leading up to the Great Recession.\n\n\"There ain't no recession,\" he wrote in December 2007. \"The Bush boom is alive and well.\"\n\nKudlow also warned that subsequent Federal Reserve policies aimed at stimulating the economy would lead to higher inflation, which didn't happen.", "keywords": ["white", "larry", "trade", "economic", "kudlow", "picks", "commentator", "policies", "tariffs", "adviser", "cnbc", "house", "trump", "president"], "polarity": 0.08482363315696649, "subjectivity": 0.33783814950481617},

But several senators have already expressed reservations because of Haspel's role in the CIA's waterboarding of al-Qaida suspects after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, posted this tweet Tuesday:\n\nWaterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods appear set for another round of litigation in the court of public opinion as the Senate prepares to vote on Haspel's nomination.\n\nIn many ways, U.S. laws and policies are much clearer today than in the past and have effectively settled some legal questions.\n\nPresident Barack Obama banned torture with an executive order in 2009. The Republican-led Congress followed up with its own torture ban in a 2015 law. The Army Field Manual spells out which types of interrogation are permitted, and waterboarding is not among them.\n\nThe likely debate\n\nStill, that doesn't mean the discussion is over. Not by a long shot.\n\n\"The debate that will occur around the Haspel nomination may help clear the air by putting these issues before the public,\" said John Prados, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, a nonprofit in Washington that advocates for government openness.\n\nHowever, if Haspel and the CIA are not forthcoming, it could create a new backlash, he warned.\n\n\"I believe the agency is mistaken if it thinks it can escape from what happened here,\" added Prados, a frequent critic of the agency and the author of The Ghosts of Langley: Into The CIA's Heart Of Darkness.\n\nJohn Rizzo, who was the CIA's acting general counsel in the period after the Sept. 11 attacks, also believes a renewed discussion could be helpful.\n\n\"Now, with the benefit of time, I think the country would be well-served by a reasoned, non-emotional discussion about whether any kind of interrogation technique, beyond a standard Q&A, is ever justifiable \u2014 or effective, for that matter,\" Rizzo told NPR's Morning Edition.\n\nHowever, Rizzo, who said he has known Haspel since the 1990s, remains a supporter of the tough interrogation methods.\n\n\"I have some regrets, but I still continue to believe the program was effective,\" he said. \"I have a strong feeling that the information in question \u2014 and there was a lot of it \u2014 would not have come nearly as quickly without resorting to aggressive measures.\"\n\nHe does not think those measure amounted to torture.\n\n\"I do not believe that the word 'torture' was and is legally accurate,\" he said. \"There were very harsh, very brutal methods. But not torture.\"\n\nTrump's campaign comments\n\nLegally speaking, an attempt to resume waterboarding or other similarly harsh techniques would require new legislation reversing the measures put in place in recent years, legal scholars say. In practical political terms, any technique that amounts to torture is certain to provoke a firestorm of criticism.\n\nTrump raised the issue during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying, \"I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\"\n\nDuring the first days of the Trump administration in January 2017, McCain said: \"The president can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.\"\n\nIn addition, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other current and former officials in the military and intelligence communities have spoken out against waterboarding.\n\nAn undercover career\n\nHaspel was an undercover CIA officer for three decades and therefore has no public record. Some Democratic senators objected when she was named the CIA's deputy director a year ago, but that position did not require Senate confirmation.\n\nIn addition to overseeing a black site prison in 2002, she was deeply involved in the 2005 decision to destroy videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. That action came after Congress had learned of the videos and called on them to be preserved.\n\nThe Justice Department spent years investigating alleged abuses in the interrogation program, but no one was ever charged with a crime. Haspel's supporters say that she and others involved were asked to do a tough job and were given assurances that their actions were legal.\n\n\"People in the prosecution of their duties inside government take on a great burden,\" said Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"They do not deserve to be indicted on Twitter or by WikiLeaks or in the press before they get a hearing.\"\n\nFor a time, Haspel was at the black site prison in Thailand where some al-Qaida suspects were interrogated after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nOne big question is whether evidence obtained during their interrogations will be admissible at a trial for the suspects.\n\nGreg Myre is a national security correspondent. Follow him @gregmyre1.\n\nEditor's note on March 16: In a previous version of this story, there was a reference to Gina Haspel's presence \"at a black site prison in Thailand\" where two al-Qaida suspects, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, were interrogated. According to several media reports, including from ProPublica, she was \"chief of base\" at that site starting in 2002. But this week, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology for some of its reporting on that point. It now says that Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment.", "keywords": ["interrogation", "haspels", "black", "cia", "nomination", "chief", "reopening", "waterboarding", "site", "cias", "suspects", "haspel", "debate", "torture"], "polarity": 0.019329381232366313, "subjectivity": 0.3866122310525296},

She especially adored the Harry Potter series, identifying with the brainy character Hermione.\n\nCarmen played guitar, violin and piano. \"She would go online and find a song she loved and just practice until she did it,\" says her younger sister Evelyn, age 14.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Couresy of the Schentrup family Couresy of the Schentrup family\n\nRobert, 18, a college freshman, highlights his sister's competitive streak. \"She always wanted to be the one who came out on top when it came to academics,\" he says, \"because I kind of had her beat in sports! She wanted to get into the best colleges she could.\"\n\nAt the time she died, Carmen had been accepted into the University of Florida's honors program, with dreams of becoming a medical researcher.\n\nUp until now, the Schentrups haven't spoken to the media about the shooting. \"We've always been private people,\" Phil explains. But they feel they can't stay silent any longer.\n\n\"We become immune to tragedy,\" he says. \"We guard ourselves from it, we don't want to think about it. We want to make it an academic debate, because then we don't have to feel the pain and suffering of others. We wanted to speak up.\"\n\nThe family hopes that by their speaking out, others can better understand that suffering: its causes and consequences.\n\n'I just want to know where my daughter is'\n\nThe day of the Parkland shooting, April Schentrup was at the nearby elementary school where she is the principal. The first hint she got that something was wrong was when she received a baffling text message from daughter Evelyn.\n\nIt said simply, \"I'm safe.\"\n\nVery quickly, news started spreading that there had been a shooting at her daughters' high school.\n\nThe relief that freshman Evelyn was okay, was followed by panic.\n\nApril called Philip to say \"Evelyn's safe, but I can't find Carmen.\"\n\nShe recalls the family's frantic search for information: calling friends, sending out messages on social media, driving from hospital to hospital searching for Carmen.\n\nNo one could tell them anything. \"All I kept saying was, 'I just want to know where my daughter is,'\" she says.\n\nAt one hospital, April was told by law enforcement officials, \"We want to be honest with you, this was a mass shooting and there were multiple fatalities.\"\n\nHer voice breaks as she continues: \"I heard what they were saying, but I didn't want to hear what they were saying.\"\n\nLate in the night, she received a devastating phone call from the sister of one of Carmen's classmates.\n\nThe conversation is etched in April's mind: \"She said, 'I'm speaking for my sister, 'cause she can't speak. She saw your daughter get shot. And when rescue came, they didn't take her with them.'\"\n\nIt would be 12 excruciating hours before an FBI agent finally confirmed to the Schentrups that their daughter was among the 17 dead.\n\n\"I think part of me just broke,\" April says, weeping as she recalls that moment.\n\n\"And even as devastating as it was, I kept thinking, 'At least one of my children came home that day.' And it's sad to think that I'm thankful that one out of two of my children came home from school.\"\n\nAs April breaks down, her children, Evelyn and Robert, lean in close, knitting their fingers around her hand.\n\nUltimately, the Schentrups learned what happened in Carmen's classroom that day.\n\nThe gunman shot out a window in the class door.\n\nHe stuck the barrel of his semi-automatic, assault-style rifle through and fired, bullets flying everywhere.\n\nCarmen was struck four times.\n\n'It's unimaginable, but ... we need to imagine it'\n\nHer father Philip's voice shakes with anger and grief as he speaks of the aftermath.\n\n\"People constantly say to me, 'I can't imagine what you're going through,'\" he says. \"Well you should. You should try to comprehend your daughter \u2014 who you are so proud of, and who was just beginning to live her life \u2013 being riddled by bullets. Being told, when the medical examiner gives the body back to the funeral home, 'You can't see her. We have to spend days working on her body. And maybe, maybe you'll be able to see her then.'\"\n\n\"Think about that,\" Philip urges. \"And then come tell me why we can't do things to keep our kids safe.\"\n\n\"It's unimaginable, but I think we need to imagine it,\" April says. \"I know we need to act. We need to do something more than pray and console each other.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Melissa Block/NPR Melissa Block/NPR\n\nWith more urgency than ever before, the Schentrups support gun control measures such as banning the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.\n\nThey want to see loopholes in background checks closed.\n\nThey talk about their views with family members who are gun owners and NRA members, and admit that those conversations can be painful.\n\nAfter Carmen was killed, Philip recalls what he heard from a close relative: \"'Sorry, but this is the way it is. This is our second amendment right.'\"\n\n\"Then I walk away,\" he says.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" April adds, \"we had another family member right when this incident happened tell me, 'We have this type of gun in our home, and we no longer want it.'\"\n\nThe Schentrups have little patience for the argument that it's the shooter that's the problem, not the weapon.\n\n\"You can say it's the man \u2013 sure,\" Philip says. \"But in the end, if we allow him to have the gun that can fire indiscriminately large amounts of bullets, that's on us. We let that happen.\"\n\n\"Yes, whether you call him crazy or just evil, he's the guy who pulled the trigger. We put a gun in his hand, or allowed him to have a gun in his hand.

But now things are out in the open and I have to speak plainly, at least to my travel agent. \"I want to go to Maiduguri,\" I say, as nonchalantly as possible.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Maiduguri in Nigeria,\" I say, hoping faintly that the poor phone connection is the reason for her question.\n\n\"You're not serious, are you?\"\n\nSabine, the owner of the little agency in Munich, is used to me by now. She's been booking my flights for years. And they have regularly taken me, as a journalist and an expert on Muslim terrorism and victim traumatization, to troubled regions of the world that no one would normally visit if they didn't have to. Sabine has organized my frequent trips to Afghanistan, Iraq or Africa without batting an eyelid. But she's unhappy about today's request.\n\n\"Maiduguri airport's been bombed,\" she informs me. \"As far as I know nobody flies there anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" I didn't know that. \"Is there a northbound bus connection?\"\n\n\"Are you crazy? It's about six hundred miles away from Abuja. And anyway ...\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" I cut in. Sabine doesn't need to say any more. It would be too dangerous to drive through Nigeria by car. The A13, the main connection with the northern cities of the state of Borno, also lies on the road on which the terrorist group Boko Haram is active. It leads straight by the notorious Sambisa Forest. This swampland is where they have been holding the schoolgirls they abducted from Chibok, nearly seventy miles south of Maiduguri, in the spring of 2014, in an act that brought the terrorist militia into the world's eye. Michelle Obama, then the First Lady of the USA, put herself at the head of the \"Bring Back Our Girls\" movement, with which parents are trying to free their children from the clutches of the terrorists. Am I going to have to forget my travel plans?\n\n\"Let me just check,\" Sabine says. I hear her keyboard clicking. \"Hm, you might be in luck: the Nigerian company Medview recently started flying into Maiduguri again, but quite irregularly. The flight might be canceled or postponed at short notice if the security situation gets worse.\"\n\n\"OK, great!\" I hear myself saying. \"Can you book them from here?\"\n\n\"I can try.\" More clicking at the other end. \"It seems to be working,\" Sabine says. \"Do you want me to book it? Or just reserve it for now?\"\n\n\"No,\" I say firmly. I've been dithering for long enough. For over a year I've been considering traveling to northern Nigeria. Since the Islamists of the Boko Haram sect in the north of the country began wreaking their havoc, and particularly since the kidnap of the Chibok schoolgirls, I've thought more and more about interviewing the female victims of the terrorist group. For a foreigner, and a white- skinned woman, such a journey is an incredibly risky undertaking. But recently I've found someone who knows the area to come with me: I can travel with Renate Ellmenreich, a retired Protestant vicar who lived there as a missionary years ago, and who still has good connections.\n\n\"I'm quite sure,\" I say to Sabine. \"Book two tickets for me.\"\n\n\n\nAbout a month before this I met Renate for the first time at Berlin's Central Station. Even though we'd only previously spoken on the phone, I recognized her straightaway. She was wearing a tweed jacket and a huge pair of purple sunglasses. The sixty-five-year-old strode energetically toward me, her freshly blow- dried pageboy cut bouncing in rhythm. \"I'm Renate,\" she said in her sonorous vicar's voice.\n\nWhen we're sitting in a caf\u00e9 a few minutes later she tells me about her time in Nigeria. Around the turn of the millennium she and her husband were sent there by the mission in Basle. Renate was assigned to the station in Gavva, a small town at the foot of the Mandara Mountains, seventy kilometers southwest of Maiduguri. Her husband, Gunnar, took a similar job in Mubi, a little further to the south.\n\nWith a pencil, Renate does me a quick sketch of the area on a paper napkin. \"Gavva's here,\" she explains, and draws a rectangle toward the top left-hand side of the district. \"And this is the Sambisa Forest, about ten miles away as the crow flies.\" I'm startled by the small distance between the two places. Renate's chosen home in Africa is in the middle of the territory where the Islamic sect is terrorizing the population.\n\n\"We would never have expected anything like this,\" admits Renate, who was doing Christian development work. \"Even then there were sporadic tensions between the Christians and the Muslims. But terrorism, and on this scale, was completely unimaginable.\"\n\nAt that moment a group of football fans drifts past us, shouting, waving the red and white flags that identify them as Bayern Munich supporters, and roaring their slogans. We have to interrupt our conversation. But Renate just smiles mildly. \"Football is mostly harmless,\" she says. \"But it's a different story if you give those young men a gun. In Nigeria, sadly, there are far too many men with guns. And it's always the women who pay in the end.\"\n\nRenate lost her husband in Nigeria back then. He died in 2004 of a brief but violent fever, caused by a tropical virus. After that she set up an aid organization for widows. Now that organization looks after women victims of Boko Haram terrorism. \"I urgently need to get back to Maiduguri to find out what the women there need most urgently,\" she tells me, deeply concerned.\n\n\"Then let's go together,\" I suggest. The fact that Renate has a local infrastructure of private contacts also brings the journey into the realms of the feasible as far as I'm concerned. \"We can depend on your people there, can't we?\"\n\n\"A hundred percent,\" she says, without hesitation. \"But let's be clear about one thing: churches and vicars are high on the list of the terrorists' targets. And foreign journalists come next.\"\n\nEven though I knew that, of course, Renate's words from our first conversation go on echoing in my head for a long time. But they won't put me off. Now we both have our tickets and our visas. She's given me precise instructions about what I need to pack: nuts, dried fruit, muesli bars, multivitamin tablets, protein shakes, bedsheets, towels, disinfectant spray, bandages, antibiotics, a mosquito net and \u2014 very important \u2014 instant coffee for our breakfast.\n\nThe food supply situation in the northeast of Nigeria is extremely poor. Since Boko Haram occupied large stretches of the terrain in 2014, the farmers haven't been able to work their fields, and harvests have failed. Food from the rich south comes to the north very rarely. First of all because there are road blocks and many attacks on transports. And also because there are hardly any solvent customers in the corrugated- iron metropolis of Maiduguri. The city is full of refugees who depend on government handouts.\n\nIn November 2015 we meet at Frankfurt airport. I've just come from Berlin, and as always I've allowed a very short transfer time. Breathlessly I dash into the departure lounge and look out for Renate. She hobbles toward me on crutches. She sprained her ankle the previous day. But clearly it didn't occur to her to cancel the trip. \"The swelling's already going down,\" she reassures me, and cheerfully waves her crutches in the air. \"I don't really need these things. But somebody in Nigeria is bound to have a use for them.\"\n\nI grin. Now I'm quite sure that Renate's exactly the right traveling companion for me.\n\nIt takes our Lufthansa plane only six hours to get to Abuja, the seat of government and the second largest city in Nigeria. We get there at four o'clock in the afternoon local time. Hard to believe there is not even a time difference with Germany.\n\nI step onto the escalator behind Renate and her crutches, and crash into a wall of tropical heat and high humidity. In the hall with the luggage carousels helpers run about busily to take our luggage outside on their trolleys in exchange for a few cents. They make an enormous racket. The only problem is: Renate's suitcase hasn't arrived. The big one, stuffed with the things that she needs for the job-finding workshops that she wants to do with the women in Maiduguri. Now we lack both the ingredients for soap production and the molds for muffin baking; these two skills were intended to enable the women to earn some money. Renate is in despair. \"I can't travel on without my suitcase,\" she tells me.\n\nWe hastily fill out a series of very complicated forms to report the loss. A young woman in a pretty straight-hair wig is very helpful to us. \"You might get your suitcase tomorrow, ma'am,\" she says, looking as if she doesn't believe it herself. \"If you like, I can keep your claim slip and pursue the matter for you at the airport. Just write your phone number on it.\"\n\n\"My phone number?\" Renate thinks for a moment. \"Yes, OK.\" She writes down the phone number of her German friend Annegret, who lives on a farm near Abuja. We will spend the first night at her place. The sixty-year-old South German is waiting for us in the arrivals hall.\n\nA little later we are sitting in Annegret's rickety Fiat. It's already getting dark. The road to the farm is quite heavily used. It leads through several small villages whose centers are recognizable by the gatherings of people and the proliferation of stalls. They are selling groceries, warm food and all kinds of paraphernalia. We buy a SIM card for Renate's phone. Then we turn on to a gravel track. From now on there are no villages; the bush used as pasture by the Fulani nomads stretches out on either side of the road.\n\nNigeria's population consists of a great variety of ethnic groups who speak a total of 514 different languages. The Fulani and Hausa in the north, who constitute about a third of the population, are among the biggest and most politically influential. They are Muslim. The south is dominated by the Christian Yoruba and Igbo, who each constitute about 20 percent of the overall population. About 180 million people in all live in Nigeria. Around half of them are Muslims, 45 percent Christian, the rest follow traditional African religions. In many places, however, widespread animist thinking mixes with the ideas of other religions.\n\nWe reach a grove of palm trees \u2014 and the road becomes even bumpier. Annegret skilfully drives around the potholes. When she stops somewhere in the darkness at last, I curiously open the door and step outside. A sweetish fragrance hits me with the warm evening air. It is very quiet. The only sound is the quiet rustle of the palms.\n\n\"Welcome to Hope Eden,\" she says.\n\nAnnegret leads us to one of the round huts that she and her husband, Shekar, rent to guests. It's made of red bricks that they bake themselves on the farm. Mosquito nets are stretched over the windows. There is no running water, but there's a big barrel from which water can be drawn, including the water for the toilet flush. Electricity comes from a solar cell on the roof.\n\nAt dinner in the main house lots of children join us at the table. They're all little relatives of Shekar that the couple have taken in so that they can go to school. Their own parents wouldn't be able to afford it. There is cassava with beans from the farm's fields. \"And you just left the receipt with that woman? Even though you don't even know her?\" she asks. \"How is she even going to get in contact with you? We have no phone reception here on the farm.\"\n\n\"Oh my. And internet?\" Just in case we don't get the suitcase in time I need to rebook our onward flights at midday tomorrow with an email to Sabine. That would definitely be easier than trying to find the relevant office somewhere around here.\n\nAnnegret smiles. \"No, there's no internet. For that you'd need to go into Abuja. It's in the opposite direction from the airport. It's about an hour to the center.\"\n\nRenate shakes her head. \"Let's just try our chances at the airport.\"\n\n\n\nThe next morning we are woken at dawn by all kinds of noises that sound like a jungle: the grove of palm trees coos, buzzes and chirrups. Annegret, who is already feeding her schoolchildren, helps us to our feet with freshly brewed coffee. It tastes delicious. \"Enjoy it,\" Renate advises me, \"we won't be getting anything like that in Maiduguri.\"\n\nWe set off immediately after breakfast. There is no public transport, such as an airport bus. So to avoid being a burden on our host we hire a car and driver from the village. \"If it all goes wrong, just come back to me,\" Annegret says as we wave goodbye.\n\nOn the way, Renate keeps trying to get through to the woman at the airport, on her mobile phone with the new SIM card, but to no avail. \"Maybe she hasn't got up yet,\" I wonder after the fifth attempt, \"or ...\"\n\n\"Or she's conned us,\" Renate says darkly. \"We've been a bit na\u00efve. With that form she could take legal possession of my suitcase whenever she liked. There's not a thing we can do. Why didn't we try her number yesterday?\"\n\nI can't give her an answer to that one. \"Maybe we'll find her at the airport,\" I say, trying to reassure us both.\n\nWe get there a short time later. But there's nothing going on at that time of day. Since no planes leave in the morning, the counters at the international terminal are all bolted shut. And of course there's no one we can ask about the suitcase.\n\nRenate and I are at a loss. She slumps exhausted on a bench and guards our luggage while I try to rebook our tickets in the national terminal. There are crowds of people at the Medview counter. I plunge into the crowd and fight my way to the front. It smells of sweat, perfume and deodorant.\n\n\"The tickets!\" the man from the airline demands when I finally manage to attract his attention amid all the competitive customers. Luckily the official language in Nigeria is English, so at least we're able to communicate with one another.\n\n\"We have e- tickets.\" I hand him my phone, on which the tickets are stored. He frowns. He definitely wants to see a piece of paper. But I haven't got one. Then he passes my phone to one of his colleagues behind the counter. They chat together, looking rather skeptical. \"Where did you book these?\" the first one asks.\n\n\"In Germany.\"\n\n\"Paid for already?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"But the numbers don't agree with our system.\"\n\nOh, great, I think. What's that supposed to mean? Is he trying to tell me that the tickets I bought in Germany are invalid? \"That's impossible,\" I protest helplessly. \"Please look again!\"\n\nMy phone wanders from hand to hand all around the airport, with me running after it. At least a dozen men stare at the document from abroad that's stored on it. It feels like hours until at last they find someone who's able to convert the international booking code into a local one \u2014 and who demands a healthy sum of money in return. I pay up.\n\nBut by now it's almost half past ten. Do we even have time to postpone the flight for another day? Just as I want to ask this awkward question, Renate hobbles up on her crutches.\n\nShe is beaming. \"The lady from the luggage office came,\" she cries, \"and the suitcase is there too!\"\n\n\"So I don't need to rebook?\"\n\n\"No, it's all fine!\"\n\nShe points to a young man who's come behind her to the counter with a trolley: all our luggage is stacked up on it. He zealously heaves our cases on to the scales, and wants to be rewarded accordingly. A hefty charge is also leveled on our excess baggage.\n\nThis is the first personal lesson that I learn about Nigeria, which enjoys the dubious reputation of being the most corrupt country in the world: there are lots of problems and there are lots of people who make money from solving those problems. Everything costs money. That's how the system works.\n\nThen we're on the Medview plane. I haven't a clue why the company should be called \"Mediterranean view.\" From the window I see the skyscrapers and the mosques of Abuja, whose domes gleam in the distance. And the vast outskirts of one- story houses that twist around the metropolis and spill further and further into the bush. The houses become increasingly humble the further they are from the center. The huts of the people who have moved from the country form the outermost ring around the city.\n\nWhen we've left even those behind, the land is more sparsely populated. Near Abuja the soil is still fertile and many of the fields grow maize or cassava. But the further north we fly, the sparser the vegetation. Soon there are only very scattered trees in the steppe- like landscape, through which the Fulani nomads drive their herds of thin cattle. The lack of rain has dried the ground out \u2014 even though the dry season has only just started. Everything seems to have the same earth- colored tone.\n\nAt last it becomes hazy. It looks as if a veil has settled over the earth. At first I think it must be clouds. But strangely they don't part even when the plane begins its descent.\n\n\"That's bad luck, the harmattan has started already,\" Renate says.\n\n\"The what?\"\n\n\"The desert storm.\"", "keywords": ["darkness", "airport", "renate", "gift", "need", "sabine", "maiduguri", "suitcase", "nigeria", "phone", "tickets", "say"], "polarity": 0.054944217045384346, "subjectivity": 0.4422938680428952},

One major change this time, however, is that Florida teenagers who survived the violence are spearheading the conversation.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee officially joined the discussion Wednesday with a hearing that opened with Florida's senators begging their congressional colleagues to act.\n\n\"We've had our fill of this in Florida the last two years,\" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., before he listed the many mass shootings the state has endured, including the Pulse nightclub massacre in June 2016 that killed 49 people.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., raised his voice as he noted that the alleged Parkland shooter, Nikolas Cruz, \"didn't slip through one crack, he slipped through every crack.\"\n\nWatch The Hearing\n\n\"This tragedy was the result of two things: the first is of a multi-systemic failure of government agencies at the federal, state and local levels,\" said Rubio. \"And second because of vulnerabilities in our existing laws that need to be addressed.\"\n\nQuestions about the FBI's actions fell to acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, who testified alongside the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Thomas Brandon, and the head of the National Threat Assessment Center, Lina Alathari.\n\nBowdich walked senators through the timeline of when the FBI knew what about Cruz and the potential threat he posed.\n\nIn September 2017, Bowdich said, the FBI received an email tip about someone posting on YouTube under the name Nikolas Cruz: \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\"\n\nAnd then in January, the bureau's tip line received a call from a close friend of Cruz's family warning that he had made statements about harming himself and others. The caller said they were concerned about him \"shooting up a school,\" Bowdich said.\n\nThe FBI operator who took the phone call found the YouTube comment thread and consulted her supervisor. After that, however, the investigation was closed without any information being forwarded to any FBI field offices or any state or local law enforcement agencies.\n\nAfter questions from senators, Bowdich said the nature of the conversation between the operator and her supervisor remained unclear because the they gave differing accounts.\n\n\"This is not the kind of news I want to deliver to this committee, to the families, or to the public, but we are committed to transparency in all that we do on behalf of the American people,\" Bowdich said. \"When we make mistakes, we will not hide from them.\"\n\nBowdich said the FBI is conducting a full-scale review of the tip line, which he said received some 765,000 calls, and 735,000 emails, last year.\n\nLocal law enforcement also reportedly missed red flags. The Broward Sheriff's Office also received a tip about Cruz potentially being a \"school shooter in the making,\" according to the Miami Herald. The newspaper says deputies didn't report the warning.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was frustrated that representatives from the sheriff's office declined to testify on Wednesday.\n\nRyan Petty, whose daughter Alaina died in the shooting, and a teacher at the high school, Katherine Posada, also gave statements and took questions as part of the hearing.\n\nPetty asked the lawmakers to put aside the basic divisiveness of broad gun control measures, to focus on specific common-sense reforms. Two weeks ago, Senate Republicans decided not to vote on gun legislation that would have changed the background check system for most gun purchases.\n\n\"Americans are deeply interested in safe schools, in caring communities and in secure neighborhoods. As the family of one of the victims, we've learned at great personal cost that Americans can come together,\" Petty said. \"We do not have to all agree on guns, and we won't. But we can agree on the most fundamental things.\"\n\nWhen asked by Grassley what Congress could do to honor his daughter's memory and legacy, Petty answered simply: Make sure \"that this never happens again.\"", "keywords": ["shooter", "school", "gun", "state", "fbi", "parkland", "mishandling", "congress", "questions", "answers", "shooting", "bowdich", "cruz", "tip", "received"], "polarity": 0.07339793281653746, "subjectivity": 0.3006376891842008},

In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn't an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries.\n\nAs she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn't clear from Trump's remarks whether that is really what he was talking about.\n\nTrump was in the midst of a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in St. Louis on Wednesday when, according to the Washington Post write-up, he riffed on a conversation he'd had with Trudeau.\n\n\" 'Trudeau came to see me. He's a good guy, Justin. He said, \"No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\" ' Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio of the private event in Missouri obtained by The Washington Post. 'Nice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \"Donald, we have no trade deficit.\" He's very proud because everybody else, you know, we're getting killed. ... \" 'So, he's proud. I said, \"Wrong, Justin, you do.\" I didn't even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \"You're wrong.\" You know why? Because we're so stupid. ... And I thought they were smart. I said, \"You're wrong, Justin.\" He said, \"Nope, we have no trade deficit.\" I said, \"Well, in that case, I feel differently,\" I said, \"but I don't believe it.\" I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \"Check, because I can't believe it.\" ' \"\n\nThis caught-on-tape moment comes less than a week after Trump signed proclamations putting stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Those tariffs won't immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.\n\nIt's not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult.\n\nAsked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question.\n\nBut he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, \"P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!\"\n\nCanada is America's second-largest goods trading partner, according to U.S. data. Trade with Canada supported some 1.6 million jobs in the U.S., according to 2015 Commerce Department figures.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Canadian government declined to comment on Trump's remarks and directed NPR to a tweet from the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, who cited the same American figures.\n\nThis is far from the first time Trump has inaccurately described the trade relationship with America's neighbor to the north.\n\nIn a December New York Times interview, Trump claimed that \"[We lost] $17 billion with Canada \u2014 Canada says we broke even. But they don't include lumber and they don't include oil. Oh, that's not. ... [Inaudible] ... My friend Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] he says, 'No, no, we break even.' I said, 'Yeah, but you're not including oil, and you're not including lumber.' When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we're losing $71 billion.\"\n\nNPR's Domenico Montanaro fact-checked this at the time. It is entirely unclear where Trump got his numbers. In a recent paper, Canada-based researchers said that if energy exports are excluded, the country runs a $78 billion manufacturing trade deficit with the United States.", "keywords": ["admits", "trudeau", "justin", "canada", "guy", "according", "canadian", "trade", "prime", "making", "talks", "minister", "youre", "deficit", "trump"], "polarity": 0.08187487116058545, "subjectivity": 0.5128123067408781},

But not even the combined talents of the secretaries of Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy seemed enough to move the ball on the $1.5 trillion plan, and it remains unclear whether the measure will ever find its way to a vote in the House or Senate.\n\nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman John Thune, R-S.D., said he was hopeful that \"both sides can come together on this and it can happen this year.\"\n\nBut several unanswered questions remain, chief among them where the $200 billion in federal funding would come from and where states would find the remainder of the money.\n\nThe Trump plan commits $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. Half of the funding, $100 billion, would be used as incentives to entice cities, counties and states to raise at least 80 percent of the infrastructure costs themselves.\n\nThat's a departure from the way many projects are funded now. Funding for federal-aid highways, including interstates, is usually allocated in an 80-20 federal-state split. So, President Trump's plan would flip that funding burden. Major mass transit projects are often funded on a 50-50 federal-local basis. Again, the administration's plan puts a much greater burden on local taxpayers and users.\n\nEstimates vary but the American Society of Civil Engineers has opined that there is a $2 trillion investment gap when it comes to the country's infrastructure needs.\n\n\"How are you gonna get members of the Senate to vote for the tax revenue in order to pay for these plans?,\" asked Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the ranking Democrat on the panel. \"We can't toll our way out,\" he said. Nelson suggested that the recently-enacted tax cut be changed from a 21-percent corporate rate to 25 percent to pay for infrastructure, a non-starter as far as most Republicans are concerned.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that with some estimates as high as $4 trillion to repair the nation's roads, bridges, ports and airports, \"We cannot address a challenge of this magnitude with federal resources alone, or by borrowing.\" She said the administration was \"agnostic\" about where the state share of the funds would come from, but said the federal government only owns 10 percent of the nation's roads and bridges, implying it was up to state and local governments to figure out where to find the funds to finance their share of improvements.\n\nSeveral states have already raised their gas taxes to fund road repairs, and others have instituted new tolls.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said Congress and the administration have \"got the identification of the problem down cold,\" adding the challenge is \"how we're going to pay for it.\" The administration's plan, he said was \"just smoke and mirrors.\"\n\nAddressing criticism that the administration only released an outline of what it hopes to see in an infrastructure plan, Chao said the administration sent Congress a list of principles rather than specific legislation in \"an open show of cooperation.\" She said the administration wants to work with Congress \"and not be prescriptive\" with specific legislative language.\n\nOne of the key principles for the administration, said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, was removing regulatory barriers to speed approval of construction projects. Perry called the current permitting process fractured and redundant, saying \"it requires projects to navigate a huge maze of federal regulations.\" Perry said Trump wants to see the process streamlined and \"substantially cut back.\"\n\nWednesday morning, the president tweeted thanking the Senate committee for helping with his effort to improve the nation's infrastructure. The president wrote that the nation's infrastructure was \"crumbling,\" and said \"We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE.\"", "keywords": ["cabinet", "trillion", "secretaries", "infrastructure", "way", "plan", "administration", "push", "nations", "congress", "federal", "funding", "projects", "trump"], "polarity": 0.03296226150392817, "subjectivity": 0.37083613916947245},

Here are some areas in which the change could make a difference.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nTillerson was caught flat-footed last week when Trump abruptly accepted an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had told reporters just a day earlier that the U.S. was \"a long ways from negotiations\" with Pyongyang.\n\nTrump acknowledged he hadn't discussed the idea in advance with Tillerson. \"Rex wasn't, as you know, in this country,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"I made that decision by myself.\"\n\nPompeo defended the president's move but stressed the U.S. and its allies will continue to press North Korea in advance of any Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\"This administration has its eyes wide open, and the whole time this conversation takes place, the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. \"There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.\"\n\nThat objective is denuclearization. According to South Korean officials who met with Kim, the North Korean leader expressed a willingness to discuss it, though it's not clear exactly what that means.\n\nIran\n\nTrump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama administration and five other countries, although so far he has stopped short of doing so. The deal gives Iran relief from certain international economic sanctions in exchange for suspension of its outlaw nuclear program. Tillerson and other national security advisers have urged the president to move carefully in overturning the deal, arguing that despite Iran's other transgressions, the nuclear agreement is working.\n\nThis was one of the key differences Trump cited in explaining Tillerson's dismissal.\n\n\"We disagreed on things,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.\"\n\nPompeo, like the president, has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal, saying it doesn't go far enough in dismantling Tehran's nuclear program and that it's not permanent.\n\n\"President Trump is determined to prevent that from happening in North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. Trump's reluctance to live by the terms of the Iran agreement, however, may affect U.S. credibility in negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\nTrade\n\nTillerson's ouster comes just days after Trump fired the opening salvo in what critics warn could become a trade war. The former Exxon Mobil CEO was among the advisers who reportedly tried to stop the president from ordering steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nPompeo defended the president in an interview with Fox News Sunday, especially with regard to China, which is widely blamed for the glut of steel and aluminum on the world market.\n\n\"It was very clear that what the Chinese are doing, whether that'd be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in East and South China Seas, this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the Chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with China in a way the world desperately needs,\" Pompeo said.\n\nChemistry\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he wished Tillerson well but conceded he and the former secretary of state often didn't see eye to eye. The president regularly undercut Tillerson, once tweeting that he was \"wasting his time\" in pursuing a diplomatic approach to North Korea.\n\nTillerson, in turn, made little effort to hide his disdain for the president.

You can barely buy a two-room apartment for less than 2 million shekels. (That's about $577,000).\n\nWhat's any of this got to do with U.S. politics? At a meeting at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump told reporters that he had rejected a $1 billion plan to build a new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Instead, he's going to build one for just $250,000.\n\nWhat a deal!\n\nBut that's not quite the whole story.\n\nWhat did Trump say?\n\nHere's what Trump said in full about the cost of the new embassy with Netanyahu by his side:\n\n\"We'll have it built very quickly. A lot of people wouldn't be doing it quickly like that. We're going to have it built very quickly and very inexpensively. They put an order in front of my desk last week for $1 billion. I said, 'a billion? What's that for? We're going to build an embassy.' I said, 'We're not going to spend $1 billion.' We're actually doing it for about $250,000. So check that out.\"\n\nTrump quickly added: \"Now, it's temporary, but it'll be very nice.\"\n\nHe then boasted: \"$250,000 versus a billion dollars.\"\n\nTurning to an already laughing Netanyahu, he asked rhetorically, \"Is that good?\"\n\nYouTube\n\nWhat was Trump talking about?\n\nWe checked it out. Is the United States somehow building \"it,\" as in a permanent embassy, for $250,000?\n\nNo.\n\nTrump was probably conflating two things: a permanent new embassy to be built years from now and a temporary embassy office the U.S. is building inside an existing consular building in Jerusalem to be set up by May, NPR diplomacy correspondent Michele Kelemen and international correspondent Daniel Estrin, based in Jerusalem, report.\n\n\"Internal modifications to allow the embassy to open in an existing facility in May is anticipated to cost $200,000 to $400,000,\" a State Department official tells Kelemen.\n\nAs for financing the permanent embassy, The Associated Press reported in late February:\n\n\"The Trump administration is considering an offer from Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson to pay for at least part of a new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, four U.S. officials told The Associated Press. \"Lawyers at the State Department are looking into the legality of accepting private donations to cover some or all of the embassy costs, the administration officials said. ... \"In one possible scenario, the administration would solicit contributions not only from Adelson but potentially from other donors in the evangelical and American Jewish communities, too. One official said Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate and staunch supporter of Israel, had offered to pay the difference between the total cost \u2014 expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 and what the administration is able to raise.\"\n\nIn January, Trump chafed at the $1 billion cost of the new U.S. Embassy in London.

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n\nIt's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\n\"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n\nAt a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n\nA December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n\n\"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n\nHe's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n\nBut President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n\nIt could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n\nThat wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n\n\"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n\nHowever, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n\nIf legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n\n\"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n\nAmong those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n\n\"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n\nAnd a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n\n\"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n\nThe special session begins April 11. The state needs a budget agreement by June 30 to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local NPR stations and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["expand", "senate", "medicaid", "virginia", "divided", "think", "republicans", "house", "expansion", "budget", "hanger"], "polarity": 0.1359292328042328, "subjectivity": 0.4262438949938949},

The outcome appears as though it will be decided by outstanding absentee ballots. But Lamb and national Democrats declared victory anyway, given that Saccone needed to win a huge percentage of those absentees to close the gap.\n\n\"It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it,\" Lamb told a roaring crowd at his election watch party at nearly 1 a.m. Wednesday morning.\n\nIntroduced as \"congressman-elect,\" the Democrat struck a conciliatory tone and promised bipartisanship once he heads to D.C.\n\n\"We fought to find common ground and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2014 each of us, Americans. ... Our job in Congress is to attack the problems, not each other,\" Lamb said.\n\nBut just before midnight, Saccone had come out to speak to his supporters, expressing confidence that they could still win.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the GOP nominee said. \"We're going to fight all the way to the end. ... We're not giving up.\"\n\nJust minutes after Saccone finished speaking, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted out a statement declaring Lamb the victor, despite AP's having said it would not call the race Tuesday evening.\n\n\"These results should terrify Republicans. ... Candidates and message matter and that was on full display in this election,\" DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Republican Congressional Committee signaled it is still waiting for all remaining ballots to be counted.\n\n\"This race is too close to call and we're ready to ensure that every legal vote is counted,\" said NRCC Communications Director Matt Gorman. \"Once they are, we're confident Rick Saccone will be the newest Republican member of Congress.\"\n\nAllegheny County counted its absentee ballots Tuesday evening. The elections director for Washington County told CNN it had 1,195 absentee ballots returned that would not be counted until Wednesday morning, but the county later reversed course and said it would begin counting them late Tuesday evening into the wee morning hours. And officials from Westmoreland County also told CNN that the 1,138 absentee ballots would be counted shortly as well, instead of on Wednesday morning.\n\nEven with such a photo finish, there is no provision for an automatic recount in a congressional race \u2014 only in statewide contests, per Pennsylvania election law. Voters can petition for a recount, however.\n\nPresident Trump won this Pittsburgh-area district by about 20 points in 2016, but it's Lamb who has run a high-energy race to challenge Saccone, after Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., resigned last year amid a sex scandal. Republicans have privately grumbled that their candidate has been lackluster, and the Democrat seemed poised to pull off the upset.\n\nIf Lamb does eke out the win, it would be the latest sign of worry yet for Republicans this fall. It's evidence of just how motivated Democrats are in 2018 and shows that the blue-collar coalition President Trump was able to build in the 2016 campaign is not necessarily transferable to other Republicans.\n\nWhile the close margin may give some solace to wary GOP members, it's still another example of Republican candidates way underperforming not just Trump's 2016 numbers but the past performance of the district, too. Murphy routinely won re-election and didn't even face a Democratic challenger the past two cycles. Other special congressional elections last year in deep red territory in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina also ended much closer than expected.\n\nIf Republicans do lose this seat, the fact they were unsuccessful also shows that the GOP's economic argument to voters and touting its tax cuts may not be enough to save the party at the ballot box, either. While early ads in Pennsylvania focused on a fiscal message, closing arguments from Republican outside groups hit Lamb on immigration and crime instead.\n\nTrump visited the district for a rally on Saturday as a last-ditch rescue mission, where he asked his supporters, \"Do me a favor. Get out on Tuesday and vote for Rick Saccone.\" Trump also referred to the Democrat as \"Lamb the sham,\" saying that if elected, Lamb would vote as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants, even though the candidate has said he would not support keeping her as leader of the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe president's visit capped off a massive effort by GOP groups to keep the seat in Republican hands. More than $10.6 million has been spent to support Saccone, about twice as much as has been spent for Lamb. That massive expenditure is despite the fact that the district won't even exist in its current form come November because of court-ordered redistricting, underscoring just how desperate Republicans were to avoid an embarrassing loss that would portend a growing blue wave.\n\nLamb had outside support in the final days from former Vice President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native. The young former prosecutor and Marine veteran homed in on local issues and eschewed most national help, and even Republicans concede he has been an unusually tough candidate.\n\nIf Saccone does win, President Trump would get credit for juicing Republican turnout in the final days. But even if he loses, the president does seem to have moved some election day voters the GOP's way, which Trump will surely seize on as well.\n\nData in the last week of the race backed up assertions from the district that Saccone's fundraising was weak. Of the more than $10 million spent to support his campaign, less than 10 percent was from the Saccone campaign itself. On the Democratic side, about two-thirds of the money spent to support Lamb came from his campaign.\n\nLoading...\n\nNational Democrats largely took a hands-off approach to the race and left most of the responsibility to Lamb's campaign, at least publicly. The DCCC stopped airing television ads weeks ago, leaving the Lamb campaign to purchase and air its own spots. But on the eve of the possible upset, the DCCC said it had invested more than $1 million in the race.\n\nThat mirrors the approach the national party took in last year's Alabama Senate race. In Pennsylvania, the DCCC largely spent the money in a behind-the-scenes way meant to help Lamb keep the race locally focused. The national party transferred more than $400,000 to Pennsylvania's Democratic Party and spent $170,000 on digital ads and turnout efforts.\n\nIn addition to that, the Democratic National Committee directed $370,000 into the race. The DNC sent $150,000 to the state party and helped the Lamb campaign raise an additional $220,000 through a joint email fundraising effort.\n\nOne byproduct of all that money and the television ads that blanketed the Pittsburgh media market in recent weeks was a lot of confused voters. Pittsburgh public radio station WESA reported that election officials in Allegheny County fielded calls all day from angry would-be voters wanting to know why their polling place was closed. The answer: These people don't live in the 18th Congressional District.\n\nDemocrats say that enthusiasm swing in a 20-point Trump district shows just how energized their voters are, even though it was a close race. It would be the first flip for House Republicans in the Trump era. A Georgia race also drew a lot of attention and money last year, but the GOP candidate eventually prevailed. Now, a Lamb victory would come on the heels of other Democratic victories, including big wins last year in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial contests, flipping 39 state legislative races from red to blue and an upset in last year's Alabama Senate race.", "keywords": ["saccone", "democratic", "republican", "campaign", "special", "election", "district", "lamb", "republicans", "race", "close", "trump", "pennsylvania"], "polarity": 0.06367665304581194, "subjectivity": 0.3865059136087177},

Here, in the crowded basement ballroom of a swanky D.C. hotel, the mockery is at least kind of the point: For 133 years, journalists have invited a constellation of Washington's bright stars in media and politics to reach across whatever distances divide them for a good verbal kick in the shin \u2014 and a hearty laugh about it together.\n\nYou can see how this might get weird.\n\n\"I know the Gridiron is really an old tradition in Washington \u2014 been around a long time, and one that's important to many of you in the media,\" Trump told the journalists gathered in the room, whom he termed his \"opposition party\" at one point in his half-hour comedy set. \"So I was very excited to receive this invitation to come here and ruin your evening in person.\"\n\nTrump takes the stage\n\nIt was just the latest Gridiron invitation accepted by a U.S. president, all but one of whom have attended the ritzy, closed-door dinner since the elite media organization's founding in 1885. (We're casting a stern eye in your direction, Grover Cleveland.)\n\nBut it's fair to say this time felt different: Trump famously turned down Washington's high-profile political media schmoozefests during his first year in office, not only rejecting the Gridiron but the White House Correspondents Dinner last year, as well. In fact, to this point, the only media gala Trump has planned to take part in during his young presidency was one of his own creation, The Highly-Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards, and that turned out to be a Web page.\n\nStill, standing behind the podium and flanked by a minor pantheon of Cabinet members and aides, Trump appeared to relish the opportunity to let loose, training his fire on just about everyone during the roast-style event.\n\nThere was his son-in-law seated to his left, Jared Kushner: \"You know, we were late tonight because Jared could not get through security.\"\n\nHis treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, sitting to his right: \"America has a proud history of treasury secretaries who sponsored the arts. Alexander Hamilton gave us so much. Andrew Mellon famously gave us the National Gallery \u2014 a tremendous gift. Steve has given us the blockbuster movie Lego Batman.\"\n\nThere was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a favorite object of Trump's biting comments on Twitter, getting one this time in person: \"You know, it's weird, I offered him a ride over \u2014 and he recused himself!\"\n\nThen he turned to his senior adviser Stephen Miller and wife, Melania.\n\n\"I like turnover,\" he said. \"Now the question everybody keeps asking is, who is going to be the next to leave, Steve Miller or Melania?\"\n\n\"That is terrible, honey \u2014 but you love me, right?\" he added, turning to his wife as the joke was greeted with gasps from the audience. And after she mouthed something off-mic, he said to the crowd: \"I won't tell you what she said.\"\n\nThe governing rule behind the evening's roast-style comedy \u2014 as laid out by Gridiron President David Lightman at the start of the night \u2014 was to \"singe, not burn.\" It was guidance Trump observed ... for the most part. To muddy a beloved adage: He reserved the brunt of his heat for some of the absent figures who had stayed out of the kitchen \u2014 such as his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who Trump called one of CNN's \"true stars, the guy who got you the most scoops and inside info.\"\n\nThat included apparently ad libbed broadsides lobbed at former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (\"man, she's crazy \u2014 but she's a fine woman\"), former Vice President Joe Biden (\"trust me, I would kick his ass\") and Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election: \"What is he, on some committee? That's the only thing he doesn't know, is what committee \u2014 because he's on the phone so much, he doesn't have any time. Hey!\"\n\nAnd then he turned to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California.\n\n\" 'He must be impeached!' That's all she knows how to say,\" Trump told the crowd. \"And I say \u2014 and I get in trouble for this \u2014 'she has to immediately take an IQ test,' and people go crazy.\"\n\n\"There's so much hatred,\" he added a few seconds later. \"We have to stop the hatred.\"\n\nBuilding bridges with North Korea?\n\nAt one point deep in Trump's set, a moment of genuine policy appeared to glimmer through the cloud of quips and digs \u2014 though whether that moment was to be taken seriously or lightly remains unclear.\n\n\"I won't rule out direct talks with [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un \u2014 I just won't. As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine,\" he said. \"He must be a fine man \u2014 do you think he's a fine man?\"\n\nLate last month the South Korean leadership said North Korea was open to dialogue with the U.S., potentially dialing down the tensions that have simmered between the two countries in recent months. Trump himself has traded barbs with Kim throughout much of his presidency.\n\n\"They, by the way, called up a couple of days ago. They said, 'We would like to talk.' And I said, 'So would we, but you have to denuke,' \" Trump said, shifting his tone.\n\n\"Maybe positive things are happening now,\" he added. \"I hope that's true. I say that in all seriousness: I hope that's true.\"\n\nTrump seemed happy with his performance at the dinner, tweeting early Sunday afternoon, \"The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People!\"\n\nBuilding walls with the warm-up acts\n\nTrump, of course, was but the closer. The sets and sketches before him teemed with other high-profile figures thrust into unfamiliar roles.\n\n\"We practiced very hard for things that don't come naturally to us,\" said Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, referring to his wife, Anna Peckham. \"For me, comedy speech; for Anna, laughing at my jokes.\"\n\nCotton represented the GOP side of the aisle with his set, following the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu. Encouraged by the fact Trump accepted the Gridiron invitation, Landrieu extended one of his own to the president: Come to the Big Easy, which has \"everything Donald Trump likes and talks about.\"\n\nParades, for instance \u2014 and walls.\n\n\"You like walls. We've got one of those. It's called the levee,\" Landrieu said. \"Too much public leaking goes on during Mardi Gras all the time. Gold: we've got that too. There are enough gold doubloons in the city of New Orleans you could literally write your name across a building in huge gold letters. Not that anybody would want to do that.\"\n\nAnd all the while \u2014 before, between and after the two politicians' sets \u2014 the journalists of the Gridiron Club carried out another tradition, dressing up and performing musical skits swiping broadly at politicians and themselves. Lifting the tunes to popular standards and swapping in some barbed lyrics of their own, not unlike the Capitol Steps, reporters and anchors traded in their gravitas for some amateur theatrics.\n\nSpeaking of weirdness, it's not often the common viewer gets a good look at [name redacted, to protect professional dignity] in a silver sequined tuxedo; [yup, these are redacted too] giving Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" dance an honest, if imperfect try; and [you'd better believe this one's redacted] dancing in a peacock suit to the belted tones of a Carly Simon satire.\n\n\"You're so vain,\" sang the pantsuited ladies in front of the dancing peacock as one woman, dressed as Hillary Clinton, crooned: \"Why can't you let this show be about me? I'm in pain! For 30 years the show's been about me.\"\n\nIn the end, though, this show was about Trump \u2014 or \"King Chaos,\" as Landrieu attempted to christen him. \"I mean, if it fits.\"\n\n\"I like chaos,\" Trump said in his own set. \"It really is good.\"\n\nAnd he closed the night of sparring with one final haymaker.\n\n\"I do want to say this is one of the best times I can ever remember having with the media,\" he said. \"This might be the most fun I've had since watching your faces on election night.\"", "keywords": ["set", "president", "media", "journalists", "jabs", "turned", "opposition", "gridiron", "dinner", "thats", "trades", "trump", "say", "party"], "polarity": 0.15118613319832827, "subjectivity": 0.5187844111624602},

Then Wedding Registry.\"\n\nThese are some of the valentine creations of Tanzila Ahmed, a Los-Angeles-based writer, artist, activist and co-host of the podcast #GoodMuslimBadMuslim.\n\nThe messages make people laugh \u2014 and squirm. And that was absolutely her intention, Ahmed says.\n\n\"It is humorous and it is loving, but I think that one of the things that happens ... when it comes to talking about Islamophobia and the politics around being Muslim, people get numb to it,\" she says. \"With humor, you're able to sneak into people's consciousness and get them to think differently.\"\n\nThe project began as a joke in 2011. At first, she made the cards for a few friends. Eventually, as demand grew, she sold them on Etsy. After a few years, she thought the project had played itself out and she stopped making the cards.\n\nThen came the 2016 elections cycle.\n\n\"There was just so much material to work with,\" Ahmed says. \"The Islamophobia that we're experiencing in America has escalated to this level that I just did not ever think that we'd ever be at, and I think, given the time, we need humor and love to push back on it.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn whether the cards make Muslims feel uncomfortable, too\n\nMy cards definitely do make Muslims feel uncomfortable. There's this perception that when Muslims present themselves in mainstream culture that we're supposed to present this \"good Muslim\" narrative, of being perfect and being a good immigrant, and not causing waves ... not being snarky, not pushing back on the status quo, and I think these cards definitely do that.\n\nOn her favorite valentine from this year\n\nI think my favorite from this year is the \"So Fly List.\" ... You have this no-fly list that so many of us are used to being on, and so I like the idea of taking that back and calling it the \"So Fly List\"\n\nOn having fun while doing serious work challenging stereotypes\n\nThere's absolutely a serious message. I've been a political activist for about 18 years now, and it's so hard to get people to pay attention to your message, and you have to be creative and you have to figure out how to use humor. I was also just tired of being serious all the time. I'm a Muslim-American woman, and I can have fun and talk about love and be a little bad. I don't always have to be that \"good Muslim\" narrative that people think that I need to be.\n\nOn the idea of combining activism with Valentine's Day cards\n\nMy whole life is a running gag. It started out as a joke on Twitter [in 2011]. I was doing publicity for an anthology I was in called Love, InshAllah: The Secret Love Lives of American Muslim Women. And all these interviewers were asking me, \"Do Muslim-American women actually experience love?\" And I was like, this is just dumb, this is ridiculous. ... These questions are very Orientalizing and fetishizing. ... So I just started letting off steam on Twitter, with the hashtag #MuslimVDay. And then I had some friends who were like, uh, make me these cards. I was like, this was just a joke. I didn't really want to. The first year I made it for my friends only. And the second year, I made a little bit more.\n\nOn whether a mostly Muslim audience is attracted to the cards\n\nI think so. I think that's who the audience is for a lot of my work. But I do have a lot of folks that are white who will buy them for their Muslim significant other, which is kind of cute.\n\nLinah Mohammad, Justine Kenin and Renita Jablonski produced and edited this story for broadcast.

His office has acknowledged receiving a request to look into the FISA matter.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday morning that won't cut it.\n\nSessions responded later in the day on Wednesday defending himself and the Justice Department.\n\n\"We have initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary,\" Sessions said. \"As long as I am the attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.\"\n\nThere's a lot going on between these two leaders. Here's a look at the backstory.\n\nFact check: Does Horowitz have \"prosecutorial power\"? The IG would not bring charges himself if he opened an investigation and discovered wrongdoing. The inspector general refers his findings to the FBI or others within the Justice Department for action \u2014 as with a case from earlier this month, for example, in which the IG's office looked into alleged misconduct by a senior FBI agent. Prosecutors would make decisions on their own about whether to opt to bring criminal charges.\n\nFact check: Is Horowitz \"already late with reports on Comey etc.\"? The IG's office has been looking into the FBI's handling of its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. That story and the conduct of officials including former FBI Director James Comey \u2014 whom Trump fired \u2014 have been a main focus for Trump and his allies. Not only do they argue the FBI and Justice abused their surveillance powers but they also argue Clinton should have faced criminal charges.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress that he expected the IG report about that era to be complete soon, although it is not yet public. There have been indications that early drafts have circulated internally with some consequences already: Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who had been expected to retire this year, may have done so because bureau officials were anxious about how the Horowitz report treated his role in the Clinton email matter or other cases.\n\nFact check: \"Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers?\" Horowitz was nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2012. Before that, he had been nominated by George W. Bush to serve on the the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a post for which he was also confirmed by the Senate. He worked as a career official in the U.S. Attorney's office in New York. So Horowitz has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations and was and remains a \"Justice Department lawyer.\"\n\nThe background: What Trump apparently wants is for Sessions to launch a full-scale criminal investigation into the applications the FBI and Justice Department made in 2016 to conduct surveillance on his onetime campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nAs Sessions responded, he says he is proceeding by the book.\n\nRepublicans have zeroed in on that warrant and argued it was obtained improperly: The FBI and Justice Department excluded the fact that part of the evidence in their application, the infamous Russia dossier, was anti-Trump political agitprop, Republicans say.\n\nIn effect, a \"biased\" FBI hoodwinked a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, as the argument goes, and violated Page's civil rights.\n\nThat argument was the thesis of the secret memo released early in February by the House intelligence committee's Republican majority. On Saturday, Democrats released their response. It argued that the FBI and DOJ had acted appropriately. Not only that, the surveillance on Page yielded what the Democrats' memo called \"valuable\" foreign intelligence \u2014 suggesting he was, in fact, contacting foreign spies or engaged in other clandestine activity.\n\nTrump's tweet on Wednesday underscores the difficulty of sustaining a strong political defense on such wonky, disputed grounds. The basis for Republicans' objection is complex.\n\nWhat's more, the argument that the Justice Department and FBI abused their powers out of anti-Trump animus is undercut by the disclosure in the House intelligence committee memos that both Obama and Trump administration officials signed warrant applications for Page. Even Rosenstein, Trump's own appointee, thought there was sufficient cause to ask for surveillance to continue.\n\nThe president supported releasing House Republicans' memo over the objections of his own administration, fast-tracked it into the open in just one week and made it possible for it to appear unexpurgated. Democrats' countermemo took much longer and appeared full of redactions by the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nTrump's tweet on Wednesday, however, suggests his patience with this thread of his defense might be running out. He has blasted the attorney general before, and other supporters also criticized Sessions' initial unwillingness to appoint a second special counsel to begin investigating the Justice Department's current special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nSo Sessions' strategy of simply raising more questions about the proper use of FISA may no longer cut the mustard \u2014 so much so that Trump asked why he should even bother. That's why the attorney general's efforts, for Trump at least, are \"DISGRACEFUL!\"\n\nNPR correspondents Carrie Johnson and Ryan Lucas contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["justice", "surveillance", "fact", "check", "probe", "trumps", "fbi", "patience", "trump", "attorney", "abuse", "appears", "republicans", "sessions", "department", "vows", "fisa", "horowitz", "general"], "polarity": 0.04582397208979487, "subjectivity": 0.4636299705919959},

Bush appointee Julie Robinson, has repeatedly chastised Kobach and his legal team for failing to submit evidence ahead of trial and then trying to incorporate it into witness testimony.\n\nThat's led to heated exchanges, with a frustrated Robinson urging Kobach \u2014 who is serving as his own attorney rather than rely on the state's attorney general \u2014 to review the basics of federal litigation.\n\n\"That's ambushing,\" she said at one point, and called a fellow Kobach lawyer \"out of line.\"\n\nKansans who say they were blocked from voting are suing over a law that requires people to show documents like birth certificates or passports to register to vote. The law took effect in 2013.\n\nLawyers from the ACLU, representing the plaintiffs, say Kobach blocked tens of thousands of legitimate voter applications. The Republican secretary of state \u2014 who hopes to be Kansas' next governor \u2014 says he is preventing non-citizens from illegally casting ballots.\n\nKansas is one of two states that require citizenship documentation for voter registration. Kobach's deposition for the trial revealed he planned at one point to speak with Trump about offering incentives to other states to follow suit.\n\nKCUR has this explainer of the lawsuit and the stakes. If Kobach loses his case, it will stop Kansas from enforcing its law on anyone who registers to vote while getting or renewing a driver's license.\n\nThe ACLU is arguing so-called \"motor voters\" are subject to a 1993 federal law that doesn't allow for Kansas' stricter system.\n\nTo win, Kobach has to convince the court he's shielding Kansas elections from non-citizens gaming the system. He claims upwards of 18,000 non-citizens could be on Kansas' voter rolls.\n\nHe has the names of more than 40 suspected non-citizens who registered to vote and is relying on statistical extrapolations to make his case that they are \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nRick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, thinks some Republican states could follow Kansas' footsteps if the court finds in Kobach's favor.\n\nHasen calls that \"red state election law,\" and says it's based on the theory that making it harder to register ultimately benefits Republicans at the polls. Democrats, meanwhile, see political benefits in easing access to the vote.\n\n\"States with Republican legislatures and governors have been passing laws that make it harder to register and vote,\" Hasen said. \"States with Democratic governors and legislatures have been passing laws that make it easier.\"\n\nThis story comes from the Kansas News Service, a collaboration covering health, education and politics across the state.", "keywords": ["rules", "noncitizens", "state", "voter", "trial", "kobach", "law", "states", "federal", "kansas", "fraud", "vote", "trump", "investigator"], "polarity": 0.021180555555555564, "subjectivity": 0.36423611111111104},

He will miss his colleagues at the Department of State and enjoyed working together with the Department of Defense in an uncommonly robust relationship.\"\n\nContinued Goldstein: \"The secretary did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted.\"\n\nLater Tuesday, Goldstein was also fired, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Goldstein both confirmed to NPR's Tamara Keith.\n\nA senior administration official says White House chief of staff John Kelly called Tillerson on Friday and notified him that he would be replaced and \"that he was being asked to step down. It was made clear that it was imminent.\" The official added that Kelly and Tillerson had a follow-up conversation on Saturday.\n\n\"He was asked to step down,\" the official said, and he didn't.\n\nTrump and Tillerson have been described as talking often but sometimes appeared quite out of step on major foreign policy decisions.\n\nA White House official says the president wanted to have a new team in place in advance of upcoming talks with North Korea and ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nTillerson, who was traveling in Africa last week, was caught flat-footed when the surprise announcement came that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just a day earlier, he had told reporters that negotiations were a long way off.\n\nTrump has named Gina Haspel, Pompeo's former deputy and a CIA veteran, to take the helm of the spy agency.\n\nHaspel did not require Senate confirmation to serve in her deputy role but will to serve as the full-fledged director of the agency. Her hearing could exhume many CIA demons about the torture of terror suspects and the secret detention program that followed the 2001 terror attack.\n\nDemocrats blasted what they called the nonstop chaos of the Trump White House, which they said meant it cannot focus on conducting business seriously.\n\n\"The instability of this administration in just about every area weakens America,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nBut another sometime-opponent of Trump's, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he would move as quickly as possible to convene a confirmation hearing for Pompeo to run the State Department.\n\n\"I had a very good conversation with Director Pompeo this morning and look forward to meeting with him soon,\" Corker said. \"As I shared with the president, the committee will consider his nomination as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nSlow burn\n\nTillerson said at the State Department on Tuesday afternoon that he was grateful for the chance to serve in government and he thanked the foreign service officers and others who work on behalf of the United States abroad.\n\nTillerson said he wants to arrange an orderly transition to Pompeo, whose Senate confirmation hearing is expected in April and appears to have the support to move into the State Department job.\n\nPBS NewsHour via YouTube\n\nTillerson said he has begun delegating responsibilities from his office to that of Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.\n\nA former boss of Exxon Mobil, Tillerson didn't know Trump before 2016, and their relationship seemed to rupture after months of disputes over policy, embarrassing leaks and a few public humiliations by the president himself.\n\nTrump told reporters on Tuesday that he and Tillerson had always gotten along and that he was a \"good man,\" but their friction over tough issues such as the Iran nuclear deal had been what compelled Trump to replace him.\n\nThe campaign may have been in the works for some time. A Nov. 30 report by The New York Times revealed the existence of a secret plan by Kelly to force out Tillerson and replace him with Pompeo.\n\nTrump would then nominate Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to replace Pompeo, according to the Times. As it happened, Cotton is not getting the nomination to lead the CIA, after all.\n\nThe report took care to say that the plan was \"tentative\" and that Trump hadn't yet approved it.\n\nThat story followed other evidence that the relationship between the president and the nation's top diplomat was barely functional.\n\nTillerson earlier said he would not resign in October after an NBC News report said Tillerson had called Trump a \"moron\" in July after a tense meeting at the Pentagon. Tillerson declined to deny it publicly, and Trump retorted to Forbes magazine that he was ready to compare \"I.Q.\" tests \u2014 \"and I can tell you who's going to win.\"\n\nTrump also undermined Tillerson's efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the situation in North Korea. As Tillerson kept up support for talks with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, Trump said on Twitter on Oct. 1 that Tillerson was \"wasting his time.\"\n\n\"Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was about five months later that Trump agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nTillerson had also distanced himself from what critics have called Trump's equivocation between neo-Nazis and counterprotesters, who clashed over a Confederate monument in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nTillerson appeared Aug. 27 on Fox News Sunday and was asked by host Chris Wallace about the way the international community views the United States following Trump's controversial comments about the protesters and counterprotesters in the wake of deadly violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We express America's values from the State Department,\" Tillerson said. And later: \"The president speaks for himself, Chris.\"\n\nTillerson's departure makes him the latest member of Trump's inner circle in the administration to step down \u2014 following a series of White House aides, starting with national security adviser Mike Flynn and continuing on to chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn \u2014 who have left their posts amid administration turbulence.\n\nIn September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was ousted over a travel expense scandal.\n\nTillerson leaves behind a State Department that critics have called a shadow of its former self because of Tillerson's disconnection from the department and the White House's antipathy toward appointing or keeping top talent in the nation's diplomatic ranks.\n\nWorld A Diplomat On The Reported 'Hollowing Out' Of The State Department A Diplomat On The Reported 'Hollowing Out' Of The State Department Listen \u00b7 3:54 3:54\n\nSome ambassadorships as well as top jobs at the department's Washington headquarters remain vacant.\n\nAnd speculation has swirled for so long that Tillerson might quit that this isn't the first wave of discussion about prospective replacements. A previous go-round centered on Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and former governor of South Carolina. The New York Times reported there was tentative talk that Trump might appoint his daughter, Ivanka, as Haley's replacement at the U.N.\n\nFor now, Haley remains in her post in New York and the Ivanka narrative appears to have cooled.\n\nTillerson's tenure as America's top diplomat was unlikely. Trump interviewed more conventional candidates, including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, but he ultimately gave the nod to the Texas oilman Tillerson based on a recommendation from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.\n\nTillerson told interviewers early on that he hadn't been looking for the job and was \"stunned\" to get Trump's offer \u2014 but his wife, Renda St. Clair, sold him.\n\n\" 'I told you God's not through with you,' \" as Tillerson recounted his wife's remarks.\n\nOilman\n\nTillerson had no government experience; he went to work in 1975 for Exxon Co., as it was then known, as an oil production engineer. But having risen to become CEO of the descendant Exxon Mobil, he effectively served as a kind of head of state \u2014 not only running the energy behemoth, but also conducting its foreign policy around the globe where it drilled or refined or conducted other operations.\n\nThat work brought Tillerson into contact with all manner of leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who awarded him Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013. Trump and Tillerson met with Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Germany in June, and then Tillerson continued follow-up negotiations with Russia until his departure from office.\n\nAs secretary of state, Tillerson belonged to a cadre of leaders who sometimes preceded Trump on international travel to assuage allies' concerns about him. Or they returned after his visits to try to smooth things over.\n\nTillerson, Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary James Mattis and others emphasized conventional points about American commitment to allies and to international norms and other longstanding points \u2014 often after Trump appeared willing to flout them.\n\nAt the same time, Tillerson stayed in lockstep with the president on many matters of policy. He defended to the State Department press corps, for example, the realism that he said underpinned the administration's new strategy focused on Afghanistan, which amounted to the new goal of playing to a draw.\n\n\"I think the president was clear this entire effort is intended to put pressure on the Taliban to have the Taliban understand: You will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, however, the new Afghanistan strategy will remain one of Tillerson's most significant elements of unfinished business. It depended upon a broad new diplomatic campaign across South Asia involving pressure on India and Pakistan to help with a good outcome in Afghanistan \u2014 even though, at the time, the United States did not have active ambassadors in India or Afghanistan.", "keywords": ["white", "state", "cia", "president", "told", "trumps", "secretary", "replacing", "mike", "pompeo", "tillerson", "department", "house", "trump", "director"], "polarity": 0.06945480885957075, "subjectivity": 0.3862154710368994},

As the OPR proposal stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,' \" Sessions also said in explaining his decision.\n\nIn a statement issued immediately after his termination was announced, McCabe said the decision was politically motivated. \"The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people,\" McCabe said.\n\n\"Here is the reality:,\" he added, \"I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens.\"\n\nMcCabe announced his retirement from the bureau abruptly in January and it was to take effect this Sunday.\n\nHis dismissal, just days before he was set to retire, puts his full pension and benefits package in jeopardy and is an inglorious end to career of almost 22 years with the bureau.\n\nA longtime target\n\nRepublicans have been attacking McCabe since the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHis wife, Jill, ran for a state legislative seat in Virginia as a Democrat and accepted campaign contributions via then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton loyalist. The FBI and Justice Department's compliance offices found no problems with the situation but Republicans called it a conflict of interest.\n\nEven while he was on the campaign trail during the 2016 race and at times since taking office, President Trump has complained about what he called McCabe's bias and called for Sessions to fire him.\n\nBy mid-December 2017, before McCabe was set to testify behind closed doors with the House intelligence committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., alluded to McCabe's rocky standing.\n\n\"I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week,\" said Gowdy, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee which has oversight responsibility for the bureau, in a Dec. 15 interview with Fox News.\n\nMcCabe served as the acting director of the FBI for three months in 2017, after Trump abruptly fired James Comey, and before the current director, Christopher Wray, was sworn in. McCabe made news in a congressional hearing in May by contradicting Trump.\n\nThe White House had said Trump fired Comey because he had lost the confidence of the FBI's rank-and-file agents and workers \u2014 but McCabe, when asked, said that was not so.\n\n\"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day,\" McCabe told lawmakers soon after the president had ousted Comey.\n\nBehind the scenes, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz was continuing to investigate Comey and McCabe and the bureau's handling of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The IG's office drafted a report that is believed to include the allegation that McCabe lacked candor with investigators about his contacts with a Wall Street Journal reporter. In addition, the statement from Sessions late Friday said the OIG and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility also faulted McCabe for \"an unauthorized disclosure to the news media.\"\n\nAccordingly, the OPR recommended that McCabe lose his job.\n\nPeople in McCabe's camp said earlier this week that he has an explanation for any inconsistencies in his account of the conversations with the journalist, and in each instance, he went back and corrected the record, often citing the chaos around him and the FBI at the time. He has followed up with investigators as part of the Justice Department process.\n\nIn his statement Friday McCabe explained events this way:\n\n\"The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\"\n\nMcCabe added that his contacts with the reporter were \"not a secret,\" were known to others at the FBI at the time including then-Director Comey, were typical of the exchanges with the media he regularly oversaw as deputy director and was also the kind of work he continued under Director Wray.\n\n\"The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth,\" McCabe also said in his statement. \"During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\"\n\nIn January, when Wray attempted to move McCabe into another job to limit the FBI's embarrassment when the IG report became public, McCabe abruptly announced his retirement. His plan was to use up accumulated leave he was due before his previously scheduled retirement date this month.\n\nTrump and his supporters group McCabe with what they call other bad actors inside the FBI, including two employees who exchanged text messages critical of Trump in 2016. That revelation also has embarrassed the FBI and fueled critics' accusations that people inside the bureau abused their power to target Trump out of personal animus.\n\nA raw deal?\n\nMcCabe's supporters, led by Comey, say he has been badly mistreated. \"Special Agent Andrew McCabe stood tall over the last 8 months, when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on,\" the former FBI director wrote on Twitter in late January when McCabe announced his retirement. \"He served with distinction for two decades. I wish Andy well.\"\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department and their allies in Congress deny the charges of \"bias\" and say there is no deep conspiracy aimed at Trump, nor any wrongdoing in use of surveillance authority by FBI or DOJ as Republicans charge.\n\nFor his part, McCabe told members of Congress shortly after Comey's firing last year that he was confident the bureau would continue to pursue the Justice Department's Russia investigation and do its other work amidst the controversy.\n\n\"You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,\" he said, \"protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.\"", "keywords": ["comey", "justice", "embattled", "short", "retirement", "fbi", "report", "investigation", "deputy", "sessions", "mccabe", "department", "fires", "trump", "director"], "polarity": 0.0011727021220692164, "subjectivity": 0.39117150430441566},

Tom Udall, D- N.M., decried the cartoon on Twitter, writing, \"Words and images are still hateful and offensive, even when they appear in a cartoon.\"\n\nIn her apology, Moses said that she couldn't say what Delonas had in mind; however, her interpretation was that \"on one level it appeared to us to be poking at President Trump's rhetoric by portraying a quaking Republican couple who were painting Dreamers with a broad, totally false, brush.\"\n\nBut Delonas, a former cartoonist at The New York Post, later contradicted Moses' take. In an interview with the Journal, he said the protesters' interpretation was right, adding that he believes unchecked illegal immigration has a negative impact on public safety.\n\n\"I'm not saying they can't come in; they have to come in legally, and they have to be vetted,\" Delonas said. \"I think you can call them Dreamers, but I kind of agree with Trump that Americans have Dreams, too.\"\n\nHe also told The New York Times, \"I've learned that MS-13 is purposely sending minors over here to commit crimes.

These alternatives, which offer coverage for a limited time, are exempted from ACA rules \u2014 including the rule that bars insurers from rejecting people who have pre-existing medical conditions.\n\n\"On the one hand, they're saying they're going to enforce the ACA,\" says Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But, Lueck adds, the Health and Human Services Department also seems to say, \" 'if you want to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions, we have some ideas for you.' And that concerns me.\"\n\nIdaho's approach, announced in January, would have allowed insurers to offer \"state-based\" insurance plans that did not include some of the ACA's consumer protections. A few weeks later, Idaho Blue Cross jumped in with five \"Freedom Blue\" state-based plans it hoped to sell.\n\nRegulators in other states were watching the Idaho situation. Its move was viewed either as a brazen effort to flout federal law or an innovative attempt to stabilize the market. Regardless, Idaho's action meant the Trump administration had to take a position: Enforce the ACA or look away.\n\nHere are four key takeaways from the administration's response to Idaho, and how the ruling may play elsewhere.\n\nStates and insurance carriers can't ignore federal law\n\nAlthough Thursday's letter from Seema Verma, head of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, commended Idaho's effort to \"address the damage\" caused by the ACA, it said that, as proposed, the state-based plans would violate at least eight of the federal health law's provisions. For example, the ACA forbids insurers from charging sick people more for a policy than it charges those who are considered healthy; it bans the establishment of annual or lifetime coverage caps; and it won't allow insurers to reject applicants who have pre-existing conditions.\n\nVerma's letter noted that if plans that don't meet ACA standards were sold in Idaho, insurance carriers might face significant financial penalties. Health policy specialists say they would be surprised if insurers would want to take that risk.\n\n\"It's one thing for the state to take on the CMS, but quite another for carriers,\" says Jan Dubauskas, general counsel for the IHC Group, which sells short-term health insurance nationally. \"When I heard that, I thought, 'This is the end for state-based plans.' \"\n\nBut Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, a Republican, has been upbeat, saying the letter from Verma \"was not a rejection of our approach,\" but \"an invitation ... to continue discussing ... what can and cannot be included in state-based plans.\"\n\nLate Friday, Idaho Blue Cross issued a statement expressing disappointment in the CMS decision, but also echoing Otter's willingness to move forward.\n\nThe timetable going forward is not immediately clear, although both federal regulators and state officials say they are willing to talk about alternatives to Idaho's original proposal. Following Verma's suggestion to get new short-term plans on the market would also require Idaho's insurers to consider their options, modify the plans and come up with new premium rates \u2014 all of which takes time.\n\nShort-term plans get another boost\n\nDubauskas and others say the Idaho decision could increase interest in short-term plans.\n\nSuch policies have been sold for years, meant as a stopgap for people between jobs. They are less expensive than ACA plans, mainly because they are allowed to reject people who have health conditions (or exclude coverage for such conditions) and have other limitations.\n\nMost short-term plans don't cover treatment for substance abuse or mental health issues; few cover maternity care and some don't include prescription drug coverage. They generally can't be renewed \u2014 meaning consumers must reapply and answer medical questions each time their policies expire.\n\nThe Obama administration, fearing that short-term plans would suck relatively healthy people out of the ACA market, limited such policies to 90-day terms. The Trump administration, however, has proposed allowing short-term plans to last for up to a year. These final rules aren't expected for at least another two months.\n\nIronically, Idaho Insurance Director Dean Cameron had in January promoted the more robust \"state-based\" plans \u2014 like those the Blues insurer wanted to sell in Idaho\u2014 as an alternative to short-term coverage.\n\nAfter getting the CMS letter, Cameron told the Idaho Statesman newspaper that short-term plans might be easier for the Trump administration to handle legally, but could cause consumers more problems than what Idaho had proposed.\n\nCritics fear that consumers will buy such plans without understanding their limitations.\n\n\"They might think it's health insurance like they're used to,\" Lueck says. \"But it's really not. It's really very bare-bones.\"\n\nState reactions will vary widely, creating different rules around the country\n\nEven if the Trump administration's proposal to extend short-term coverage to a full year is finalized, states can set stricter rules.\n\nA handful of states already do.\n\nNew York and New Jersey require many of the same rules as the ACA for policies sold in their states. But insurers won't sell short-term plans there.\n\nFour states \u2014 Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Oregon \u2014 limit the length of short-term plans sold in their states to 185 days, according to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund and researchers at Georgetown University.\n\n\"A small group of largely blue states have some regulation [of short-term plans], but not very many,\" says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. \"It's possible that if this rule is finalized we will see more states start to step up and regulate short-term markets.\"\n\nConversely, lawmakers in other states may promote short-term coverage as a lower-cost alternative to the ACA \u2014 although people with pre-existing conditions may not be able to buy such plans.\n\n\"Politically, short-term plans have some appeal because lawmakers can say now there's a cheaper option out there,\" Corlette notes.\n\nThe increased emphasis on short-term plans could increase premiums\n\nActuaries fear that short-term plans \u2014 or state-based plans like those rejected in Idaho \u2014 would drive up costs for people who remain in more comprehensive ACA coverage.\n\nThat's because younger and healthier people might be tempted to drop their ACA coverage, leaving only those who are older, sicker and costlier in the remaining pool. That, in turn, drives up premiums \u2014 affecting millions of Americans who don't receive subsidies and already struggle to pay for their health insurance.\n\nBut just how many people would jump to new, short-term coverage?\n\nThe Trump administration has estimated that about 100,000 to 200,000 people with existing ACA coverage would make the shift, while other specialists in health insurance suggest higher numbers.\n\nChristopher Condeluci, a Washington, D.C., attorney who specializes in employee benefits and previously served as the tax and benefits counsel to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, says it's unclear which estimates are correct.\n\nThe real issue to keep in mind, Condeluci says, is that an increasing number of people who don't get subsidies are already choosing to either forgo coverage or pick an alternative, such as a short-term plan.\n\n\"People are voting with their feet,\" he said. \"That cannot be overlooked.\"\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Her research is an inspiration to a generation of technically curious cheesemakers: she is the cheese geek's cheese geek. When American cheesemaker Mateo Kehler talks about the on-site laboratory that he and his brother Andy have set up at the Cellars at Jasper Hill in Vermont, he jokes that \"there is already a lab coat hanging up here with Marie-Christine's name on it.\"\n\nSo there was great excitement when Montel was invited to deliver a presentation on her work with the Salers producers and their gerles at the 2015 American Cheese Society conference in Providence, Rhode Island. The annual conference is the single largest gathering of North American cheesemakers, importers, and sellers. There are educational sessions, industry briefings, and plenty of swag. Delegates wear intricately color-coded badges to denote their status, with categories ranging from members of the press to senior attendees, who are labeled \"Aged to Perfection.\" At the 2015 meeting, twelve hundred people packed into the Rhode Island Convention Center to learn, gossip, and do business.\n\nWhen it came time for Montel's presentation, a large audience crowded into the seminar room. But as they heard the tale of the gerles and saw the experimental data, they sat unmoved. The elegance of the microbiology, the revalorization of ancient cheesemaking techniques, and the implications for understanding and enhancing their own cheeses were lost on the crowd. Instead, in the question and answer session at the end, it became clear that the research on gerles had seemed irrelevant to the majority of the audience. What most people wanted was advice on potential pathogens and handling issues with public health officials.\n\nThe audience had not been ready for her message, had not been primed for a world where microbial biodiversity could be the defining goal of good dairy farming. It was, said Montel afterward, as if she were \"from a different planet.\" It was true. She might as well have delivered a lecture on unicorn ranching. Despite our frustration, we could recognize and appreciate the concerns of the audience. Their problems were intimately familiar: this was the dairy world in which Bronwen's family had lived for over a century.\n\n\n\nYOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S HERD\n\nA decade earlier, amid the cocktail chatter at our wedding in London, two dairy industries collided. Many of our guests were Bronwen's colleagues from Neal's Yard Dairy in London, a company that has come to emblematize the revival of British farmhouse cheese. Seated next to the company's sales director was Bronwen's uncle Eddie. We always thought of Eddie as a car enthusiast ex-NASA engineer, but he was also a farmer, fighting a last stand to maintain the viability of the California dairy that had been founded by Bronwen's great-grandfather.\n\nAt the time, Eddie's farm in California was comfortably larger than any dairy operation in the United Kingdom. However, even with thousands of cattle, the farm was too small to prosper amid the vicissitudes of the American market for liquid milk. Despite milking high-yielding cows twenty-four hours a day, life was a struggle. But this was not a consequence of his poor management or lack of business savvy; rather, he was the prisoner of a market that was beyond his control.\n\nBronwen's great-grandfather, Fred Imsand, was a Swiss emigrant to California at the turn of the twentieth century. From a dairying family, he found work at a dairy while he romanced the chambermaids of San Francisco. He survived the 1906 earthquake by the simple expedient of standing in an empty lot during his milk-delivery run, and in the ensuing chaos he made his way to San Bernardino in Southern California, where through a combination of savings, resourcefulness, and gruff charm he acquired a farm of his own, Meadowbrook Dairy.\n\nThe dairy of Fred's era was diversified and complete. Beyond the cows and their milk, the family farmed chickens and pigs, smoked their own hams, and sold produce from their orchard. Yet Bronwen's grandparents eventually rebelled against the unremitting toil of this system, embracing the progressive promise of scale, mechanization, and specialization. By the late 1950s, the dairy was a successful local business, with a fleet of milk trucks and \u2014 as the Inland Empire grew into Eisenhower-era suburban comfort \u2014 five little dairy drive-thrus.\n\nFred had started out with a herd of twenty Holstein cows, but Bronwen's grandfather Eddie Sr. recognized the direction that the milk market was going and made every effort to expand the business. In this environment, Bronwen's mother's involvement in the dairy as a young woman was restricted to some light bookkeeping as she studied for her medical school exams; a loathing for calves' liver is the only legacy of her upbringing on a dairy farm.\n\nBy the early 1970s, as supermarkets began to dominate retail sales, Eddie Sr. decided to concentrate solely on producing liquid milk and abandoned direct-to-consumer sales completely. With that decision came expansion: by the time Bronwen's mother graduated from college, the herd numbered just under four hundred cows. It was ultimately a question of pragmatism, and decisions were made in order to survive. Eddie Sr. had spent a year studying at the University of California, Davis, in the 1930s before the worsening economic climate of the Great Depression demanded that he return to work on the farm, and at each stage of Meadowbrook Dairy's expansion, he looked to the experts at UC Davis \u2014 one of the major American centers for industrial agricultural research \u2014 for advice. Each decision he made was based on progressive mainstream ideas about best practice.\n\nThe pace at which Meadowbrook Dairy grew mirrors trends in dairy farming within the United States at large. We can see these changes reflected most starkly in US Department of Agriculture statistics. From 1970 to 2006, average herd size leapt from just 19 cows to 120 cows per farm. Hidden within the arithmetic mean is an even more significant change: small dairy farms are disappearing rapidly. The smallest class of farm, those with fewer than thirty cows, might still constitute nearly 30 percent of all dairy operations, but together this bottom third represents only 2 percent of all cows and 1 percent of milk production. In contrast, between 2000 and 2006, the number of farms with more than two thousand cows doubled. In 2006, almost a quarter of all milk production \u2014 and the majority in the western United States \u2014 took place at these megadairies.\n\nEurope is also seeing a steady consolidation of the dairy industry and growth of herd size. The number of registered dairy producers in the United Kingdom dropped by more than half from 1998 to 2013. From 2008/9 to 2012/13, the only UK dairy farms growing in size were those producing more than two million liters of milk a year; based on average milk yields, the average herd size of these farms was approximately three hundred cows. With milk prices at historic lows, milk production at dairies with more than two thousand cows is becoming more widespread. Where the United States has led, Europe is following.\n\nChange came rapidly to Meadowbrook. A sudden series of family bereavements led to a swift generational succession, and in 1978, at age twenty-seven, Bronwen's uncle Eddie took full responsibility. It was a tough time. The suburban expansion of San Bernardino was about to swallow the dairy, and strategic decisions had to be made. Again, the advice of the dairy extension program at UC Davis proved critical. Resisting a possible move to the San Joaquin Valley, Eddie relocated the entire operation fifty miles north across the San Gabriel Mountains to El Mirage. While the high desert did not afford lush pastures, a new five-hundred-acre alfalfa ranch provided vertical integration. The dairy's systems were pared down for maximum efficiency, and an anaerobic digester was installed that converted manure into electricity. Again, scale increased. At its peak, the new operation was milking 2,200 cows, but life was still a struggle.\n\nFor this most mainstream of dairies, there was no sense that processing the milk on the farm or attempting to produce a unique product could add anything to the sustainability of the operation. When family members talk about the dairy, their pride is palpable, but each commercial decision and each stage of growth is explained and rationalized as the inevitable consequence of market conditions. Over the more than thirty years Eddie spent running the farm, he was beaten down by a commodity market that he could not control. His is a common stoicism: \"Every farmer goes through periods of up and down; it's a cyclic business as far as profit and loss go. It's never been a business where you can count on a percentage of margin.\"\n\nThe farm's milk contract paid according to total solids \u2014 the number of pounds of butterfat and protein that the herd could produce \u2014 so the system was optimized for maximum production with maximum efficiency. In this model of dairy farming, controlling feed costs is everything, and Eddie was forced to become increasingly sophisticated at supplementing the silage and hay that he made himself with cheaply available commodity by-products. Technology helped. Eventually, it was simply a question of entering the details of the almond hulls, cottonseed, or citrus pulp into the computer to get the appropriate balance for a nutritionally optimized total mixed ration.\n\nTo this extent, Meadowbrook Dairy was the diametric opposite of Guy Chambon's operation. The entire conceit of Chambon's Salers Tradition is to have cows who will thrive in a place where they will eat interesting food \u2014 hence the painstaking twice-daily milking in the pastures on the top of a mountain \u2014 and then let the cheese make itself, with a little help from the gerles. Uniqueness is fundamental. Taken together, these farming and cheesemaking practices, from the choice of the cussed and archaic Salers breed to the maintenance of the biodiversity of the mountainside pastures and the microbial biofilms on the wooden gerles, make for the production of something that could not be achieved anywhere else. In contrast, Meadowbrook Dairy tacitly accepted that their output would be blended with milk from many other sources and that the route toward commercial sustainability was through efficiency and growth. Instead of keeping cows in a place where they would eat interesting food, Meadowbrook kept its cows where space was cheap and then fed them carefully calculated inputs to keep costs down and yields up.\n\nWhen none of his children expressed any interest in dairy farming, Eddie ultimately took the opportunity to divest himself of the business. When we talk with him now, his sense of relief is clear, even if it is bittersweet: \"We ended up taking this as a time we could slow down and keep the [alfalfa] farm out in Inyokern, and we donated the land to the water district. It was an opportunity that comes along only once or twice in a lifetime.\"\n\nAlthough the cheesemakers attending Montel's presentation at the American Cheese Society conference almost certainly operated on a smaller scale than thousand-cow dairies, the mentality with which Eddie worked would have been familiar to them. It is true in much of Europe as well, where the scale might be smaller still but the same pressures toward consolidation, volume, and efficiency are being felt. For Bronwen, this too is familiar. When she was a teenager, she and her family had managed, by following received notions of best practice, to domesticate industrial dairying.\n\n\n\nINDUSTRIAL WRIT SMALL\n\nUnlike her mother, Bronwen did not grow up on a dairy farm. Visits to her cousins at Meadowbrook Dairy brought exotic new experiences, like the opportunity to climb mountains of fuzzy cottonseed feed, but the dairy and its evolution registered only vaguely on her consciousness. Her parents settled several hours further south in eastern San Diego County, in the foothills of the Cuyamaca Mountains. With hot, dry summers and mild winters, the area was dominated by chaparral and horse fancy. Surrounded by equestrianism, Bronwen soon became obsessed by the desire to own a horse.\n\nAnd so as she began junior high school, Bronwen joined the local 4-H club along with her best friend Melody; it seemed more exciting than the Girl Scouts, and it would give her the chance to make a halter for the horse of her dreams. But Melody, whose family owned a billy goat called Buck Rogers, also convinced Bronwen to sign up for the dairy goat group. At the first meeting, she was exposed to the vision of baby goats frolicking in fresh straw, and all thoughts of horses were immediately banished. Bronwen's parents recognized a modified win when they saw one, and within days a goat pen was being constructed in the backyard.\n\nWhen Bronwen's parents, a musicologist and a physician, bought a house with land, they had no intention of dabbling in domestic dairying; they simply needed space where they could practice the violin without the neighbors complaining. Music loomed large in their lives \u2014 they had first met as teenagers playing in the same orchestra \u2014 and distance from other neighbors allowed assiduous practice to be combined with the odd hours of the work schedule at the hospital. While Bronwen's mother had been raised on the dairy farm and her father's family had dabbled in semisuburban farming when he was young, they had no firsthand knowledge of animal husbandry. Jerry Belanger's book Raising Milk Goats the Modern Way (Garden Way Publishing, 1975) would be their homesteading bible.\n\nThe goats, Natasha and Ginger, were to play a major role in the life of Bronwen's family for the next six years. They grew into glossy, glorified pets, but a vague sense of paranoia surrounded their management. Their pen sat within a two-and-a-half acre goat smorgasbord packed with sumac, foxtails, eucalyptus, manzanita, and native sages. This type of Mediterranean scrubland is one of the classic environments for goat foraging, a way of exploiting marginal land that has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nThe goat book, however, suggested otherwise, claiming that a diet foraged from the native chaparral was poor in nutritional value and would lead to malnourished goats and problems with worms. The family deemed it much safer to buy in a mixture of hay, fermented alfalfa with molasses, and vitamin-enriched, grain-based goat chow for them to eat. In an area famous for its raging wildfires, with strict requirements for brush control, the goats looked on quizzically every summer as Bronwen's father scoured the property with a weed whacker and the family raked and bagged up the fallen weeds to take to the local dump. Ironically, within the world of forestry management, goat grazing is now regarded as one of the most effective weed management solutions for fire prevention; it is also inexpensive, nontoxic, and nearly carbon neutral. At its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Google now uses goats for just this purpose.\n\nThen there was the question of sex. There was no mistaking when the goats came into heat: the sex-starved animals would stand on the big rock in the middle of the pen and bleat loudly and incessantly. Were it not for this habit, they would likely have been bred only a couple of times. But as it was, they got their way year after year. When it came time to breed them, they were loaded into the back of the family's dusty Chevrolet Suburban and whisked off to the goat breeder's for a quickie with the buck. Bronwen's father remembers setting aside his Messiaen program notes on a day when the rest of the family was gone, the kids all at school, and \"driving the goat off to get nailed.\"\n\nWhen the baby goats arrived, the family kept the females or gave them to other members of the 4-H club who wished to found their own goat dynasties, but their sentimental approach to animal husbandry left them in a quandary when it came to the boys. The first set of kids were both, tragically, male. They were sent off at a tender age to \"eat grass\" in a friend's backyard. Another male kid followed; we learned in researching this book that he ended up as the main course at a family friend's Easter celebration. Had Bronwen known the truth at the time, she would have been beside herself, but it highlights a perennial problem for sentimental domestic dairy farmers: males. Unless you are prepared to eat them, they have no value. Bronwen's reservations about eating her pets were not remarkable. When we talked with Jeannette Beranger, senior program manager for the Livestock Conservancy in the United States, it became clear that many sentimentalists dabble in homesteading with rare breeds. Beranger launched into an anecdote about an enthusiastic couple with whom she worked who could not bear to see any of their males killed or eaten. The couple had the capital to keep them, ultimately tending a separate paddock of forty lost boys. Without those resources, even the ethically consistent lacto-vegetarian will eat veal.", "keywords": ["goat", "family", "bronwens", "milk", "goats", "eddie", "farm", "meadowbrook", "reinventing", "cows", "dairy", "wheel"], "polarity": 0.10870145330859624, "subjectivity": 0.4613576410362123},

Bush.\n\nHaspel's role in it meant that when Trump nominated her for the No. 2 job last year, critics within and outside of Congress called for her to be blocked even though she did not require Senate confirmation.\n\nTo become full director, however, she will. Haspel is up for the top job because Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and announced he planned to nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place.\n\nSo Haspel would need to go through what could be a bruising confirmation hearing that reopens the vault on secret prisons, torture, alleged cover-ups and accountability.\n\nHaspel would be the first woman to lead the CIA, and Trump told reporters outside the White House that he had gotten to know her well.\n\nIntelligence veterans call Haspel one of their own and say the time is right for her to hold the reins.\n\n\"When she was selected to be deputy director, I think the choice was enthusiastically received at CIA,\" former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. \"In all this turmoil, I actually think CIA is going to be a bit of a calm spot with Gina now being elevated to the director position.\"\n\nPolitics A Former Director On What Leadership Change Means For The CIA A Former Director On What It Means For The CIA Listen \u00b7 6:12 6:12\n\nEveryone at the CIA in the post-Sept. 11 era was simply doing what they were asked to do in the aftermath of a crisis, Hayden said.\n\nOpponents, however, made clear that they believe the Senate intelligence committee should not confirm Haspel.\n\n\"During Gina Haspel's long tenure at the CIA, she oversaw the agency's torture and rendition program, one of the bleakest chapters in our nation's history. No one who had a hand in torturing individuals deserves to ever hold public office again, let alone lead an agency,\" said Raha Wala, director of national security advocacy for Human Rights First.\n\n\"To allow someone who had a direct hand in this illegal, immoral and counterproductive program is to willingly forget our nation's dark history with torture,\" Wala added.\n\nOther opponents said Pompeo and Haspel should be able to go forward into new roles so long as they made a clear break with brutal interrogations and the past conduct of the CIA.\n\n\"Both nominees would have to disavow all previous statements and actions advocating this unlawful conduct if they are to be seriously considered as candidates,\" said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.\n\n\"Torture, extraordinary rendition, and indefinite detention are unacceptable, and we cannot allow human rights abuses to be condoned in the name of national security,\" she said.\n\nMany Democrats, however, may fully oppose Haspel. Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico both wrote Trump last year to say they felt she should not get the deputy director job at CIA.\n\nWyden said on Tuesday that he feels the same way now.\n\n\"Ms. Haspel's background makes her unsuitable to serve as CIA director. Her nomination must include total transparency about this background, which I called for more than a year ago when she was appointed deputy director,\" his statement read. \"If Ms. Haspel seeks to serve at the highest levels of U.S. intelligence, the government can no longer cover up disturbing facts from her past.\"\n\nMaine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key voice on the intelligence committee, said on Tuesday that she would reserve judgment for now.\n\n\"I have met Gina and I know of her decades of experience at the CIA,\" Collins said. \"I prefer to wait to have a confirmation hearing before making a decision on her nomination. She certainly has the expertise and experience as a 30-year employee at the agency. But I'm sure there's going to be some questions raised.\"\n\nOpponents in the wider Senate made clear there could be no correct answers to these questions.\n\n\"I voted against Mr. Pompeo's nomination to be CIA director because he failed to express moral opposition to torture, but Ms. Haspel has done much worse,\" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.\n\n\"Not only did she directly supervise the torture of detainees, but she also participated in covering it up by helping to destroy the video evidence,\" Duckworth said. \"Her reprehensible actions should disqualify her from having the privilege of serving the American people in government ever again, but apparently this president believes they merit a promotion.\"\n\nIf Democrats elect to oppose Haspel as a bloc in committee or the full Senate, Republicans will need all the votes they can get in order to confirm her, assuming the ailing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., remains absent from the chamber.\n\nMcCain said on Tuesday: \"The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history. Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA's interrogation program during the confirmation process.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., opposed Pompeo as CIA director, and if he opposes Haspel as well, that could make for a narrow tightrope to walk.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, however, appeared eager to get Haspel's nomination on his committee's calendar.\n\n\"I know Gina personally and she has the right skill set, experience, and judgment to lead one of our nation's most critical agencies,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm proud of her work, and know that my committee will continue its positive relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency under her leadership. I look forward to supporting her nomination, ensuring its consideration without delay.\"\n\nNPR correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report", "keywords": ["gina", "tough", "cia", "nominee", "intelligence", "faces", "senate", "nomination", "confirmation", "committee", "torture", "road", "haspel", "trump", "director"], "polarity": 0.03487542696403455, "subjectivity": 0.4211194220687892},

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n\nIt's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\n\"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n\nAt a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n\nA December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n\n\"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n\nHe's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n\nBut President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n\nIt could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n\nThat wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n\n\"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n\nHowever, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n\nIf legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n\n\"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n\nAmong those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n\n\"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n\nAnd a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n\n\"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n\nThe special session begins April 11. The state needs a budget agreement by June 30 to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local NPR stations and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["expand", "senate", "medicaid", "virginia", "divided", "think", "republicans", "house", "expansion", "budget", "hanger"], "polarity": 0.1359292328042328, "subjectivity": 0.4262438949938949},

In a week that saw Secretary of State Rex Tillerson fired by tweet, there is renewed speculation that national security adviser H.R. McMaster or other members of the Cabinet may be on their way out. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins me now from the White House. Hi, Tam.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: Let's start with McMaster. What is the latest on his status?\n\nKEITH: So NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman reports that McMaster will likely leave, although there is no timetable on when that might happen. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders last night tweeted out that she had spoken with the president when a story emerged in The Washington Post saying that Trump had decided that he was going to remove McMaster. And Trump told her that that was not accurate, that he has no intention of making a change there at this time and that the two of them have a great working relationship.\n\nNow, randomly there have been a lot of H.R. McMaster sightings around the White House today, which doesn't always happen. A bunch of us reporters were walking through the West Wing in areas where we're allowed to walk. And what do you know? There was H.R. McMaster standing there sort of near the Oval Office.\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter) Right.\n\nKEITH: And then an ABC News correspondent tweeted that she caught up with him outside of the West Wing. And she said that he told her that Sarah Sanders had set things straight. And then he added, everybody has got to leave the White House at some point. Then she says she asked whether he was leaving sooner rather than later. And he said, I'm doing my job and walked away.\n\nSHAPIRO: You know, people are sometimes criticized for focusing on palace intrigue.\n\nKEITH: Yes.\n\nSHAPIRO: And there has been a lot of turnover at this White House. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and national security adviser H.R. McMaster are two vital positions, and a change in both or either of them means a big change in the way American policy is determined and executed.\n\nKEITH: Right. And just think about the timing on this. This is right after President Trump has accepted this offer to meet with the North Korean dictator, though there isn't a lot of clarity on where and when exactly that will happen. You know, the national security adviser position is a very important position in terms of sort of figuring out how the dialogue works within the White House and externally and sort of managing the White House foreign policy.\n\nSHAPIRO: When you have a White House with this much turnover and speculation about future turnover, how does that affect people doing their everyday jobs? I mean, how does it affect morale?\n\nKEITH: Well, can you imagine if this was happening in our office every day?\n\nSHAPIRO: No.\n\nKEITH: It would be terrible. You know, Sarah Sanders said that today, chief of staff John Kelly actually sat down a bunch of senior staffers this morning and told them that - you know, tried to reassure them. And here's how she described that conversation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Reassuring them that there were no immediate personnel changes at this time and that people shouldn't be concerned. We should do exactly what we do every day, and that's come to work and then do the very best job that we can.\n\nKEITH: No immediate personnel changes at this time is neither reassuring nor particularly conclusive, especially when you have the president himself saying just this week, there will always be change, and I think you want to see change.\n\nSHAPIRO: There has been controversy surrounding several other Cabinet secretaries recently and speculation that any of them might be replaced. Can you run through who they are and what the White House is saying about them?\n\nKEITH: I - we don't have time for me to go through all of them.\n\nSHAPIRO: Because it's such a long list, OK (laughter).\n\nKEITH: It is a very long list, and people sort of rotate on and off. But Sarah Sanders today was specifically asked about VA Secretary Shulkin, who was on the receiving end of a very critical inspector general's report - also HUD Secretary Ben Carson, who is still trying to get his story straight about a $31,000 dining room set that was ordered for his office. That order has been canceled. She was asked whether the president offered the same assurances to them that he offered to H.R. McMaster, and she simply repeated, we don't have any personnel changes at this time.\n\nSHAPIRO: NPR's Tamara Keith at the White House.

That changed during the 2016 presidential race.\n\n\"I was going out into the field and covering a lot of Trump rallies and talking to people,\" Klepper says, \"and they were getting a lot of their ideas and their news from these far-right sources. So what first felt fringe, suddenly felt mainstream.\"\n\nToday those sites are required reading for Klepper's job. As the host of Comedy Central's satirical political show The Opposition, Klepper delivers commentaries in the persona of a far-right conspiracy theorist.\n\n\"He creates his own reality,\" Klepper says of his character. \"He sees the two dots and he fills the spaces with the things that make him feel more comfortable.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn developing his character for The Opposition\n\nThe character that I play lives in this world of Alex Jones, but is not a one-to-one satirization of Alex Jones. We kind of wanted to create a character that stood alone from those characters. So it's got the paranoia and the opportunism of an Alex Jones; it's got the Trump support of a Sean Hannity. It feels like state-run media. It's got the snark and smarm of a Jesse Watters, and it's got a little bit of Midwestern Jordan Klepper in there as well.\n\nThe look that we've started to cultivate is less like \"I'm a New York guy with skinny ties and thin suits.\" ... These guys like to have flashier suits, bigger watches, big stripes and things of that nature. And so costume-wise we try to go in that direction. They sort of all preach the prosperity gospel; they're going to talk about God. But the best way to show that you are a person of God and living a righteous path is that you are successful. I think the Jordan Klepper character on the show wants to show he's successful in how he looks and how he holds himself.\n\nOn how he relates to the people he satirizes\n\nI don't want to overplay my hand as someone who has lived a really difficult, tough life. I've been very fortunate. I had a great upbringing. [But] trying to become a professional comedian had its toil. I didn't have a lot of successes.

Am I thoughtful enough?\" And I do think we're all dealing with those issues and we all have those fears deep down inside. ...\n\nWhen I look at these characters who might be more on the fringe, who I disagree with ideologically or the things that they're pushing, and I try to find what is really going on right there \u2014 \"Why are you pushing so hard against this anti-intellectualism? Why are you so angry?\" \u2014 it's like, I think I can relate to [you] because you are scared.\n\nOn how \"resistance\" is a theme for both the left and the right\n\nYou see the ideology that exists on these far fringier sites like Infowars and even Breitbart \u2014 they're not like traditional Republican ideologies. They're based in conflict and opposing the mainstream \u2014 anti-mainstream, anti-intellectualism, anti-fact in many ways.\n\nAs we wanted to build this show, we saw that, \"This is all opposing something. Find an enemy. Call it out. We want to be that.\" We also realized what was so interesting is [Jones] was calling himself \"the resistance\" at the same time Keith Olbermann had a show calling itself The Resistance, and it felt like a very American moment that we could all be united in being against something. We're all resisting something. We all want to be the underdogs.\n\nOn getting cast for The Daily Show over his wife and comedy partner, Laura Grey\n\nThey had us both audition and we went through a bunch of rounds. We both came in and read with Jon [Stewart] and they could only take one person, and I was the person who got that job, which was one of the weirdest, strangest, happiest, saddest moments of my life. ...\n\nWe had worked together for so long, worked on these projects and gotten so close to this really cool dream job \u2014 one which she was so perfect for, I felt I had a strong chance for. ... So I got to go along with it and she didn't and started working on other things. ...\n\nIt's kind of the truth of this industry. On the outside everything is a dream and you get to have dream jobs. And, again, I am so fortunate with the opportunities that I had, but up until that point, Laura and I had both been doing comedy for 15 years and we had some successes, but a lot of that was us making videos ourselves on no money, teaching improv 40 hours a week to try to get by, hustling, getting really close to opportunities and then failing. So this idea of this dream thing happening and everything is great is a fallacy. I think when I had that opportunity ... it was a mix of so many emotions. It's always going to be complicated.\n\nHeidi Saman and Seth Kelley produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

One basic notion that is false is the idea the Obama administration took no action \u2014 it did. The question that has been asked many times since the presidential election is why it didn't do more.\n\nPrivate warnings\n\nAmong other things, top U.S. intelligence officials \u2014 including then-CIA Director John Brennan \u2014 privately warned their Russian counterparts not to persist with their active measures. Obama himself told Russian President Vladimir Putin not to interfere in the election. These warnings did not work.\n\nPublicity\n\nObama administration officials also told reporters on background that Russian intelligence operatives were behind the cyberattacks that led to the release of emails stolen from political figures and institutions. Later, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson formally blamed the Russian government in an official statement.\n\nAlthough it wasn't universally accepted, the active measures campaign became a part of the political campaign itself. Trump and opponent Hillary Clinton traded barbs about the Russian interference during their debates.\n\nYouTube\n\nTrump has gone back and forth about what he accepts and what he doesn't about the nature of the attack. Sometimes he acknowledges it; other times he has cited the denials he has gotten from Putin, saying, \"I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"\n\nThe president's position since Friday's indictments has been that the interference campaign did take place \u2014 but that he and his campaign had nothing to do with it. On that point, Trump has been consistent: There was, he says, \"no collusion.\"\n\nMueller is focused on whether that is so and whether Trump may have broken the law if he tried to frustrate the investigation. More on this below.\n\nDiplomatic response\n\nAfter Election Day, Obama ordered the U.S. intelligence community to issue a public report about the Russian scheme. Once it had \u2014 and concluded Russia's attack was aimed at helping Trump and hurting Clinton \u2014 the United States imposed a slate of punitive measures against Moscow. In addition to imposing new sanctions, Washington also expelled a number of Russian diplomats and closed two Russian diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York.\n\nSo why didn't Obama's administration do more?\n\nThat isn't clear. Some former administration officials who have talked about it publicly have reproached themselves for not acting more aggressively. There also was a long-standing criticism of Obama that his foreign-policy making amounted to endless process with no outcomes \u2014 hours of meetings that yielded more meetings but no ultimate action.\n\nPlus, the relationship between the United States and Russia is multifaceted and often intensely complicated:\n\nObama scaled back missile defense plans in Europe to placate Moscow.\n\nObama wanted Russia to play a role in the international agreement under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program \u2014 and Putin went along.\n\nObama spent the end of his presidency trying to bring Russia into a multilateral agreement to end the Syrian civil war, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ultimately never committed.\n\nSo Obama's team had to manage many spinning plates in addition to the active measures campaign it detected by the middle of 2016. One question Obama may address in his book is why he calibrated his choices in the way he did \u2014 whether he looked the other way on election interference to keep open other options elsewhere.\n\nA partisan tightrope\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden also has complained that the White House wanted Republicans to join in a bipartisan statement announcing and condemning the interference campaign. In Biden's telling, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., wouldn't go along.\n\nBut that didn't stop then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., from alluding publicly to the Russian campaign in a letter to then-FBI Director James Comey. And Comey reportedly wanted to announce the active measures in an op-ed column, as Newsweek reported in March 2017. Two sources with knowledge about the matter told Newsweek that Obama administration officials blocked the effort.\n\nThere's no way to know what difference it might have made for U.S. officials to have confirmed and condemned the Russian interference in real time.\n\nObama administration officials have said they worried about appearing to put their thumb on the scales for Clinton. Combined with Obama's belief that Clinton would win, their political calculus appears to have boiled down to: Let's ride this out.\n\nObama himself said in December 2016 that he wasn't convinced that he should have done anything different.\n\n\"There have been folks out there who suggest somehow if we went out there and made big announcements and thumped our chests about a bunch of stuff, that somehow it would potentially spook the Russians,\" he said. \"I think it doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well.\"\n\nFACT CHECK: The intelligence community did not make an assessment about how the active measures campaign affected the 2016 election. Trump and supporters have sometimes said incorrectly that the report found there was no effect; in fact, it did not address the question. Homeland Security officials did conclude that cyberattacks didn't tamper with vote tallies in 2016.\n\nWhy aren't Democrats under investigation?\n\nSome of them may be. FBI special agents in Arkansas are reportedly conducting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. But Trump and his allies, especially Republicans in the House, want more. They say this story is about abuse of power by the FBI and Justice Department and \"bias\" within those agencies against the president.\n\nTrump wants Attorney General Jeff Sessions to do more work to expose those aspects of the story. He may, but so far Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have said they don't see enough cause to appoint a second special counsel in addition to Mueller.\n\nWhy is Trump under investigation?\n\nPart of Russia's active measures campaign included clandestine overtures from human intelligence operatives to people in the Trump campaign. When the FBI learned that a junior foreign policy adviser in London got offers of \"dirt\" on Clinton or \"off the record\" meetings with top Russian officials, it began a counterintelligence investigation that continues to this day.\n\nSeveral other people in the Trump campaign had contacts with Russians before and after Election Day. Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. received an email that included what was described as an offer of help for the campaign from the Russian government.\n\n\"If it's what you say, I love it,\" Trump Jr. wrote back.\n\nHe later hosted a delegation that included a Russian attorney and a Russian-American lobbyist; the details of what took place in the meeting are disputed.\n\nMore contacts took place. An adviser traveled to Moscow. Other contacts involved Sessions \u2014 then an Alabama senator, who now serves as attorney general but is lately the target of Trump's ire \u2014 and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, who today is dueling behind the scenes with White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nThe contacts continued until just before the inauguration. As Obama was imposing punitive measures against Moscow following the election, Trump's administration-in-waiting was asking its Russian interlocutors not to retaliate.\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, asked Russia's then-ambassador to the U.S. to hold off because it could expect a different approach once Trump was inaugurated. Putin agreed.\n\nThere have also been suggestions that Flynn and the Trump administration planned not only to renegotiate financial restrictions with Moscow once Trump was in office but had already decided before the fact to lift sanctions.\n\nFlynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the conversations he had with Russia's ambassador and is cooperating with Mueller's investigation.", "keywords": ["interference", "stop", "obama", "active", "check", "campaign", "administration", "election", "trump", "russias", "measures", "2016", "officials", "russian", "didnt", "fact"], "polarity": 0.04008700809548266, "subjectivity": 0.33116730256560784},

The Florida Senate approved a bill last weekend that would cover lost wages for first responders with PTSD, and the House followed suit on Monday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott is now saying he will sign the bill.\n\n\"I intend to sign it as soon it makes it to my desk,\" Scott said, speaking at an event to honor firefighters who died in the line of duty. \"What this will do is ensure firefighters suffering from PTSD can receive workers' comp benefits.\"\n\nAbout a third of states have similar laws. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, also the state fire marshal, called PTSD a \"hidden killer.\"\n\n\"This benefit is needed so we ensure that our firefighters don't have this as their only option, our first responders don't look to suicide as the outlet to sort through the demons they deal with and these horrific images,\" Patronis said.\n\nChanging the law has not been easy. Legislation was introduced after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando two years ago. That shooting left 49 people dead. At least three first responders to the shooting have publicly disclosed that they have been diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nThe bill languished in Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature last year, and a related measure's prospects had been uncertain this year. The Florida League of Cities, for example, raised concerns about the costs to local governments that pay for police and fire departments.\n\nI have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\n\nBut after the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, in which 17 people died, opposition to the bill faded.\n\nBefore the final floor vote, state Rep. Matt Willhite looked up to the gallery where Linda Benoway was watching. Willhite told her he was sorry.\n\nBenoway's son Stevie LaDue, 55, died by suicide in September. Before his retirement after 30 years as a Tampa firefighter, he tried to get workers' comp because of PTSD. When the state denied his claim, he had to go back to work and pay back the time he missed.\n\n\"Why I say I'm sorry to you is because the system failed you, and prior to today, we failed you,\" Willhite said. \"Your son, this may have saved his life.\"\n\nAfter Willhite spoke, the bill passed unanimously.\n\nThe bill also comes too late for Josh Vandegrift, a firefighter and paramedic in the city of Cocoa.\n\nVandegrift was just starting a 24-hour shift in July 2016 when the call came in: A pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle about 100 yards from his station.\n\nVandegrift and other firefighter paramedics responded by ambulance, and Vandegrift cleared bystanders out of the way.\n\n\"I looked down and I saw my brother's face on the patient,\" he said.\n\nNate Vandegrift, his younger brother, had been hit by a commercial van crossing the street. Josh Vandegrift began to treat his brother before being removed from the scene by police officers. \"I remember just absolutely losing it in the middle of the road.\"\n\nNate Vandegrift died about eight hours after the accident. Since then, Josh Vandegrift has had nightmares and flashbacks. He avoids the intersection if possible.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Vandegrift with PTSD. He took his sick time and vacation time, and when that ran out, co-workers donated their sick time to him. When that ran out in August 2016, he applied for workers' compensation. His claim was denied.\n\n\"I had to go back to work or resign, basically,\" said Vandegrift, who returned to work. \"I have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\"\n\nVandegrift, one of dozens of first responders who have answered WMFE and ProPublica's request to hear from first responders suffering from PTSD, won't benefit from the new law. The legislation will cover people who make a workers' comp claim after Oct. 1, 2018, as long as the triggering event was within the prior year.\n\nThat means Parkland first responders could be covered, but not Vandegrift and responders to the Pulse nightclub shooting. Vandegrift said he knew before he started advocating for the law that it likely wouldn't apply to him.\n\n\"If anything happens in the future, something is in place now so nobody will have to go through what I went through,\" Vandegrift said. \"You know, to be able to get out of bed in the morning.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Built by private contractors from across the country, from Maryland to Arizona, the prototypes have been funded with $20 million from Customs and Border Protection.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and several Border Patrol officials briefed the president on the ongoing assessment of the prototypes, the White House says, \"with a focus on how the features and attributes of each impedes illegal crossings.\"\n\nUltimately, the Trump administration expects that the whole border wall, when completed, would cost about $18 billion \u2014 though other estimates have ranged up to $38 billion. Despite a concerted effort from the White House and many GOP lawmakers, efforts to apportion that money have stalled in Congress, along with broader conversations around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other immigration programs.\n\nTrump's campaign pledge to build a massive wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico has proven just as divisive outside Capitol Hill. Just a day before Trump's arrival in California, the state's Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, called on the president to extend the focus of his visit beyond the wall.\n\n\"You see, in California we are focusing on bridges, not walls. And that's more than just a figure of speech,\" Brown said in a letter to the president he posted publicly Monday.\n\n\"After you've examined your wall prototypes on the border,\" he added, \"I invite you to head north to the Central Valley \u2014 the heart of California. Here in cities like Fresno and Madera more than a dozen bridges are being built for the nation's first and only High-Speed Rail line.\"\n\nOthers, such as San Diego-based immigration advocate Andrea Guerrero, see the president's proposal as an alarming symbol of the policies his administration has pursued.\n\n\"The wall is more than a wall,\" she told NPR's Richard Gonzales before Trump's arrival. \"In the shadow of that wall, a deportation force is growing and it is ripping families from one another. It is devastating communities well within the interior of the United States.\"\n\nDuring remarks to media Tuesday, Trump countered those fears by raising still others.\n\n\"There's a lot of problems in Mexico \u2014 they have a lot of problems over there,\" he said. \"The fact is, if you don't have a wall system it would be bedlam, I imagine.\"\n\nLater, he stopped in at the nearby Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, addressing an often-boisterous crowd \u2014 and promoting what he called \"the largest military buildup since Ronald Reagan and one of the largest buildups we've ever had in the history of our nation.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nAmong other things, the president promised the assembled members of the military their \"largest pay raise in over a decade,\" brand-new warplanes and and a national strategy that \"recognizes that space is a war fighting domain \u2014 just like the land, air and sea.\"\n\n\"We may even have a 'space force,' \" he added. \"Develop another one: We have the Air Force, we'll have the space force.\"\n\nHe is expected to wrap up his day in Los Angeles with a fundraiser later in the evening.", "keywords": ["space", "wall", "largest", "mexico", "trip", "whirlwind", "mockups", "california", "talks", "tours", "border", "military", "prototypes", "trump", "president"], "polarity": 0.00608108108108108, "subjectivity": 0.3481981981981982},

The Republican secretary of state \u2014 who hopes to be Kansas' next governor \u2014 says he is preventing non-citizens from illegally casting ballots.\n\nKansas is one of two states that require citizenship documentation for voter registration.

There's been a whole lot of that news (laughter) about Russia over these last few days.\n\nKELLY: There has indeed. To review, there's the sanctions that we know the Trump administration imposed yesterday which the Kremlin is displeased over because they continue to insist that they did not interfere in U.S. elections - also, Ari, that they didn't carry out cyberattacks on the U.S. power grid. Oh, and by the way, they did not poison the former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.\n\nSHAPIRO: All of that.\n\nKELLY: That's the line here in Russia - no. And meanwhile, we got this whole presidential election going on. So we've got lots more on that later in the program. But let me hand it back to you for now for our weekly discussion about U.S. politics.\n\nSHAPIRO: OK, looking forward to hearing more from you in a bit, Mary Louise. But first, for that weekly political discussion, we have Mary Katharine Ham, senior writer at The Federalist. Hi There.\n\nMARY KATHARINE HAM: Hi. Thank you for having me.\n\nSHAPIRO: And also here in the studio - Kimberly Atkins, reporter and columnist at the Boston Herald. Hi again, Kimberly.\n\nKIMBERLY ATKINS: Hi there.\n\nSHAPIRO: Let's start with that U.S.-Russia relationship and the sanctions that the White House announced this week. Do you think those sanctions, that acknowledgement by the Trump White House shows that this president has finally caught up with his intelligence community in the agreement that Russia interfered with the 2016 elections, Kimberly?\n\nATKINS: I think not quite yet. I mean, you saw even after the announcement of these sanctions, which are the toughest sanctions that this administration has handed down against Russia so far, there still is not a willingness to say for certain, unequivocally that Russia is a bad actor.\n\nYou saw Sarah Huckabee Sanders still saying, well, it depends on what Russia does from here on in. You know, you saw the president not really talk about the sanctions or the actions that Russia has taken against the U.S. even when he was talking about this poisoning in the U.K. that the U.S. issued a joint statement condemning. So it still seems to be a hesitancy there to fully embrace that.\n\nSHAPIRO: Mary Katharine, how do you interpret these sanctions?\n\nHAM: I mean, well, there are - well, first of all, it's a big step to recognize that not only have they gone past the disinformation campaign but into actual infrastructure, which is a huge deal.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah.\n\nHAM: And so to recognize that with actual action is big. I do think Trump is willing to admit that for a moment, and then he might change his mind later. Other folks in the administration - H.R. McMaster, Nikki Haley, even Mike Pompeo, who will now be secretary of state - have been much harder on this line.\n\nSo you've got this strange dichotomy where at times the Trump administration is quite tough on Russia substantially or substantively with closing a consulate in San Francisco or with these sanctions. But you do not have a united front because the leader is missing in action and has sometimes been far too kind to Putin.\n\nSHAPIRO: Let's move on from the U.S. relationship with Russia to this dramatic week of staff changes, from the secretary of state being fired in a tweet to a close personal aide to the president apparently being deemed a risk to national security and walked out of the White House. Last night, there were some headlines that the national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, was going to be ousted immediately then maybe not so immediately. This afternoon, here's what press secretary Sarah Sanders said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: The chief of staff actually spoke to a number of staff this morning, reassuring them that there were no immediate personnel changes at this time and that people shouldn't be concerned.\n\nSHAPIRO: At this time - Mary Katharine, how do you think this turmoil affects President Trump's agenda?\n\nHAM: Well, I think it makes it hard to focus on something like, say, Infrastructure Week, which we've tried several times now.\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter) Right.\n\nHAM: Look; the Trump White House does operate differently just as the Trump Organization operates differently. This is how he likes to manage, and I'm not sure it's that effective. It's like the online dating app of White Houses.\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter).\n\nHAM: There's a lot of heat and fire, not a lot of thought about compatibility, very little vetting. And in the end, you get ghosted or texted to be dumped.\n\nSHAPIRO: (Laughter) Or tweeted.\n\nHAM: But yeah, it's not a great way of doing business, and I don't think it helps him actually move legislation and goals forward.\n\nSHAPIRO: Kimberly, President Trump says this is how he enjoys working. So what's wrong with that?\n\nATKINS: Well, it is how he enjoys it. I think he is fine with this setup even if the people around him are kind of flailing in this chaos. Remember; he came from \"The Apprentice.\" He likes being at the table and saying, you're fired. And I think he's more comfortable being in that position, going with his gut, with his instincts than necessarily relying on people around him who later on - as we've seen in many instances, he can regret following other people's advice and wishing he would - stuck to his own guns.\n\nHAM: I will say often his second choice is a more compatible choice that actually ends up being more functional - a Kelly at chief of staff or - and I think Pompeo likely at secretary of state. So there is that.\n\nSHAPIRO: I also want to talk about this week's special election in Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, Conor Lamb, the Democrat, apparently just barely won this district that President Trump carried by more than 20 points. Kimberly, do you think this one special election should redefine the way Democrats and political observers go into the midterm elections?\n\nATKINS: I think they should pay careful attention to it. Look; I always say special elections are special. They are - they measure what's happening on the ground more than the national feeling. But in this sense, there's a lot to draw from it. There is an anti-Trump sentiment that can be palpable here. You - it's about choosing good candidates.\n\nConor Lamb seemed to be the perfect candidate for this district at this time. And it brings in, you know, this idea of how strong Trump will be. If he's going out on the campaign trail for the midterms like he promises he will, will this be a get-out-the-vote effort for the Democrats?\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah.\n\nATKINS: It's really a lot of things at play here, and I think the - both parties need to pay careful attention to that race.\n\nSHAPIRO: The line we heard this week from Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan was that the Democrat ran as a Republican, and as a conservative. Mary Katharine, does that give any consolation to the Republicans who appear to have lost this race?\n\nHAM: Look; he did run as a moderate Democrat, and I do think that's something Democrats should pay attention to. Notably, he was not picked by primary, so it wasn't progressive activists and that energy that was working on his behalf. It was, you know, committee sort of chairmen who did that. And I think that's how you got a more moderate candidate.\n\nBut what you can't ignore is that the swing away from Republicans toward Democrats in every special election has been uniform, right? That's the problem for Republicans. There's a real issue there, and they can't rely on Democrats to pick two liberal candidates in every single race.\n\nSHAPIRO: Just briefly in our last minute, in Washington and across the country this week, we saw students walk out of school to protest gun violence. Do you both think we're seeing a new political movement here, or is this just a moment?\n\nATKINS: I think we're seeing a cultural change. I think people are finally looking at guns and gun violence, particularly in schools, in a new way that can help change sentiment. I don't think that that can come from the Capitol, from lawmakers. I think it comes from communities, and these students are a example of that.\n\nSHAPIRO: Last word, Mary Katharine.\n\nHAM: I think the question is always whether this is social media and media fire but doesn't actually lead to change. I think that's the question. And as a lifelong contrarian, I'm also worried about dissenting voices and when you're up against the behemoth of your school administration sort of pushing this and national media pushing it. I - my best wishes to those who might have disagreements on these policies and not walk out or walk with a different sign. I support them as well.\n\nSHAPIRO: Mary Katharine Ham, senior writer at The Federalist, thanks very much for joining us. And Kimberly Atkins, reporter and columnist for the Boston Herald - good to have you both here.\n\nHAM: Thanks very much.\n\nATKINS: Always a pleasure.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

And he managed to snag a rather high-profile guest: Barack Obama.\n\nThe full audio of the interview is available here for the next six days. The interview was taped in September during the Invictus Games in Toronto, an event created by Harry for wounded, injured or ill servicemen and veterans.\n\nThe conversation is billed as the first interview with the former president since leaving the White House, and it's not exactly hard-hitting.\n\nBut it does offer a window into Obama's life now: still driven by purpose, but with less adrenalin and more leisurely breakfasts.\n\n\"I didn't used to experience traffic,\" Obama says. \"I used to cause traffic.\"\n\nThe transition of power\n\nLeaving the White House after the inauguration, Obama says, his first thought was gratitude for his wife, Michelle.\n\n\"She is not someone who was naturally inclined to politics, so in some ways, despite the fact that she was as good of a first lady as there's ever been, she did this largely in support of my decision to run,\" Obama says.\n\n\"For us to be able to come out of that intact, that our marriage was strong, that we're still each other's best friends, our daughters turning into amazing young women ... that we had done the work in a way that preserved our integrity and left us whole\" was a satisfying feeling, Obama says.\n\nThe former president doesn't mention Donald Trump by name but does acknowledge some worries as he left office.\n\n\"That [feeling of satisfaction] was mixed with all the work that was still undone, and concerns about how the country moves foward,\" he says. \"But overall, there was a serenity there. More than I expected.\"\n\nAdjusting to a different pace\n\nObama says it was \"strange good fortune\" that he and Michelle were in their 40s before being in the public eye. The result was that when his presidency came to an end, his entire identity wasn't wrapped up in the position.\n\n\"One of the interesting things about leaving the presidency is realizing that my life had been so accelerated,\" he says. \"Everything felt like, and still feels to some degree, like it's moving in slow motion.\"\n\nHe describes the sense that important things need to be done immediately, because \"where I'm from 'right away' means if we don't do something in half an hour somebody dies.\"\n\nGetting used to a slower pace means \"you don't have the same adrenaline rush, but it also means that you can be I think more reflective and deliberate about the kinds of things you want to get done.\"\n\n\"The fact that I can wake up and if I want to spend an extra 45 minutes talking to Michelle and take a long breakfast \u2014 I can do it,\" he says. \"That feels great.\"\n\nHe says he is now \"obsessed with training the next generation of leaders\" and that he is transitioning into being a coach rather than a player.\n\nThe impact of social media\n\nPrince Harry notes that trolling, extremism, fake news and cyberbullying have become major issues and asks Obama whether there are things he wishes he had done on those issues.\n\n\"[The] question I think really has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a balkanization of our society, but rather continues to promote ways of finding common ground,\" Obama says. \"I'm not sure government can legislate that, but what I do believe is that all of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can re-create common space on the Internet.\"\n\nBack when there were just three TV stations, Obama says, \"everybody had a common set of facts.\"\n\n\"There might be conservatives or liberals, but people generally could agree on a baseline of reality. One of the dangers of the Internet is that people can have entirely different realities. They can just be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.\"\n\nHe says one thing he discovered during his campaign in 2007 and 2008 was the importance of bringing online communities offline.\n\n\"Social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interest to convene,\" he says, \"but then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighborhood, and get to know each other. Because the truth is, on the Internet, everything is simplified. And when you meet people face to face, it turns out they're complicated.\"\n\n\"It's also, by the way, hard to be as obnoxious and cruel in person as people can be anonymously on the Internet,\" Obama adds.\n\nObama as royal wedding guest\n\nObama and Harry were quite chummy during the interview, but one subject didn't come up: whether the former president will be invited to the prince's wedding, scheduled for May 19 at Windsor Castle.\n\nSome in the U.K. press have speculated that inviting the Obamas could complicate the British government's relations with Trump.\n\nThe BBC posed the question of whether Obama will be invited to Harry himself, who demurred.\n\n\"We haven't put the invites or the guest list together yet, so who knows whether he's going to be invited or not,\" Harry replied. \"Wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\"", "keywords": ["white", "barack", "interview", "obama", "harry", "way", "met", "ways", "used", "common", "life", "things", "tells", "house", "meet", "prince"], "polarity": 0.06938657407407409, "subjectivity": 0.417636684303351},

Since taking office in January, she's been juggling daycare and feeding schedules around meetings and late-night votes. She often ducks her 13-month-old under a nursing cover and continues on with her business.\n\nTran has been a working mom before; her older three children stay in northern Virginia with her husband while she's in Richmond. She was elected in November 2017, in the first wave of women to run for office after President Trump's election.\n\nTran says she made the decision to run when her youngest was a month old.\n\n\"So she was with me throughout the entire campaign. We did a lot of door knocking together,\" Tran says.\n\nHer colleague, Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, learned she was pregnant two weeks after announcing her own candidacy in early 2017. She says she was motivated to oppose President Trump's agenda, and finding out she was expecting a baby \u2013 twins, as it turned out \u2013 did not deter her.\n\n\"I knew that, you know, no matter what I thought, no matter what I had going on, this was so important. Because there needed to be a response and counterbalance to what he was bringing to the table,\" Carroll Foy says.\n\nFamily and friends helped her campaign through a difficult pregnancy that included bed rest and preterm labor.

It's a slow process, he says; the House chamber didn't even have a women's restroom until a renovation completed in 2007.\n\nThe historic nature of the Virginia Capitol doesn't help.\n\n\"We're cramped for space in this office, to be honest, so having a dedicated room \u2013 everything's sort of spoken for, so we have to kind of retrofit and work around that,\" Nardo says.\n\nFor now, Nardo says two lactation rooms have been set aside in a nearby legislative office building.\n\n\"Having gone through the first session with this many women of child-bearing and \u2013rearing ages, we're working through it,\" Nardo says.\n\nWhile Democrats Tran and Carroll Foy are newcomers, other female lawmakers before them have had to navigate similar challenges, one at a time.\n\nIn 2008, Republican state Sen. Jill Vogel was the first Virginia state lawmaker to have a baby while in office. She remembers slipping away to pump breast milk, then sending it to her office with a Senate page.\n\n\"They had no idea what they were delivering,\" Vogel says with a laugh.\n\nVogel says the work culture around politics has lagged behind the private sector in accommodating working moms. She says she often gets asked how she can be both a mother of six and a legislator \u2013 a question her male colleagues are less likely to face.\n\n\"In a private sector job, you wouldn't think twice; you'd say 'Of course I can do both and be competent at both,'\" she says. \"So I didn't apologize.\"\n\nState Sen. Jennifer McClellan, a Democrat, was a state delegate in 2010 when she had her first child. She asked to borrow an empty office when she needed to pump, and she now offers her own office to staffers, lobbyists, and any other new moms at the Capitol who might need a space to pump.\n\n\"I even made a sign that had a picture of a cow that said, 'Do not enter,'\" McClellan says with a laugh. \"And it was like, you know, don't ask questions when you see that, just don't come in.\"\n\nMcClellan says it's important to accommodate young mothers in politics, in part because of the perspectives they bring to issues like education and childcare.\n\n\"You get a different perspective once you are living that life.\" McClellan says.\n\nIt's a relatively new challenge; women have long been under-represented in elected office.

As the OPR proposal stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,' \" Sessions also said in explaining his decision.\n\nIn a statement issued immediately after his termination was announced, McCabe said the decision was politically motivated. \"The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people,\" McCabe said.\n\n\"Here is the reality:,\" he added, \"I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens.\"\n\nMcCabe announced his retirement from the bureau abruptly in January and it was to take effect this Sunday.\n\nHis dismissal, just days before he was set to retire, puts his full pension and benefits package in jeopardy and is an inglorious end to career of almost 22 years with the bureau.\n\nA longtime target\n\nRepublicans have been attacking McCabe since the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nHis wife, Jill, ran for a state legislative seat in Virginia as a Democrat and accepted campaign contributions via then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton loyalist. The FBI and Justice Department's compliance offices found no problems with the situation but Republicans called it a conflict of interest.\n\nEven while he was on the campaign trail during the 2016 race and at times since taking office, President Trump has complained about what he called McCabe's bias and called for Sessions to fire him.\n\nBy mid-December 2017, before McCabe was set to testify behind closed doors with the House intelligence committee, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., alluded to McCabe's rocky standing.\n\n\"I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week,\" said Gowdy, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee which has oversight responsibility for the bureau, in a Dec. 15 interview with Fox News.\n\nMcCabe served as the acting director of the FBI for three months in 2017, after Trump abruptly fired James Comey, and before the current director, Christopher Wray, was sworn in. McCabe made news in a congressional hearing in May by contradicting Trump.\n\nThe White House had said Trump fired Comey because he had lost the confidence of the FBI's rank-and-file agents and workers \u2014 but McCabe, when asked, said that was not so.\n\n\"Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day,\" McCabe told lawmakers soon after the president had ousted Comey.\n\nBehind the scenes, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz was continuing to investigate Comey and McCabe and the bureau's handling of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The IG's office drafted a report that is believed to include the allegation that McCabe lacked candor with investigators about his contacts with a Wall Street Journal reporter. In addition, the statement from Sessions late Friday said the OIG and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility also faulted McCabe for \"an unauthorized disclosure to the news media.\"\n\nAccordingly, the OPR recommended that McCabe lose his job.\n\nPeople in McCabe's camp said earlier this week that he has an explanation for any inconsistencies in his account of the conversations with the journalist, and in each instance, he went back and corrected the record, often citing the chaos around him and the FBI at the time. He has followed up with investigators as part of the Justice Department process.\n\nIn his statement Friday McCabe explained events this way:\n\n\"The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.\"\n\nMcCabe added that his contacts with the reporter were \"not a secret,\" were known to others at the FBI at the time including then-Director Comey, were typical of the exchanges with the media he regularly oversaw as deputy director and was also the kind of work he continued under Director Wray.\n\n\"The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth,\" McCabe also said in his statement. \"During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.\"\n\nIn January, when Wray attempted to move McCabe into another job to limit the FBI's embarrassment when the IG report became public, McCabe abruptly announced his retirement. His plan was to use up accumulated leave he was due before his previously scheduled retirement date this month.\n\nTrump and his supporters group McCabe with what they call other bad actors inside the FBI, including two employees who exchanged text messages critical of Trump in 2016. That revelation also has embarrassed the FBI and fueled critics' accusations that people inside the bureau abused their power to target Trump out of personal animus.\n\nA raw deal?\n\nMcCabe's supporters, led by Comey, say he has been badly mistreated. \"Special Agent Andrew McCabe stood tall over the last 8 months, when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on,\" the former FBI director wrote on Twitter in late January when McCabe announced his retirement. \"He served with distinction for two decades. I wish Andy well.\"\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department and their allies in Congress deny the charges of \"bias\" and say there is no deep conspiracy aimed at Trump, nor any wrongdoing in use of surveillance authority by FBI or DOJ as Republicans charge.\n\nFor his part, McCabe told members of Congress shortly after Comey's firing last year that he was confident the bureau would continue to pursue the Justice Department's Russia investigation and do its other work amidst the controversy.\n\n\"You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing,\" he said, \"protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.\"", "keywords": ["comey", "justice", "embattled", "short", "retirement", "fbi", "report", "investigation", "deputy", "sessions", "mccabe", "department", "fires", "trump", "director"], "polarity": 0.0011727021220692164, "subjectivity": 0.39117150430441566},

The Florida Senate approved a bill last weekend that would cover lost wages for first responders with PTSD, and the House followed suit on Monday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott is now saying he will sign the bill.\n\n\"I intend to sign it as soon it makes it to my desk,\" Scott said, speaking at an event to honor firefighters who died in the line of duty. \"What this will do is ensure firefighters suffering from PTSD can receive workers' comp benefits.\"\n\nAbout a third of states have similar laws. Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, also the state fire marshal, called PTSD a \"hidden killer.\"\n\n\"This benefit is needed so we ensure that our firefighters don't have this as their only option, our first responders don't look to suicide as the outlet to sort through the demons they deal with and these horrific images,\" Patronis said.\n\nChanging the law has not been easy. Legislation was introduced after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando two years ago. That shooting left 49 people dead. At least three first responders to the shooting have publicly disclosed that they have been diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nThe bill languished in Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature last year, and a related measure's prospects had been uncertain this year. The Florida League of Cities, for example, raised concerns about the costs to local governments that pay for police and fire departments.\n\nI have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\n\nBut after the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, in which 17 people died, opposition to the bill faded.\n\nBefore the final floor vote, state Rep. Matt Willhite looked up to the gallery where Linda Benoway was watching. Willhite told her he was sorry.\n\nBenoway's son Stevie LaDue, 55, died by suicide in September. Before his retirement after 30 years as a Tampa firefighter, he tried to get workers' comp because of PTSD. When the state denied his claim, he had to go back to work and pay back the time he missed.\n\n\"Why I say I'm sorry to you is because the system failed you, and prior to today, we failed you,\" Willhite said. \"Your son, this may have saved his life.\"\n\nAfter Willhite spoke, the bill passed unanimously.\n\nThe bill also comes too late for Josh Vandegrift, a firefighter and paramedic in the city of Cocoa.\n\nVandegrift was just starting a 24-hour shift in July 2016 when the call came in: A pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle about 100 yards from his station.\n\nVandegrift and other firefighter paramedics responded by ambulance, and Vandegrift cleared bystanders out of the way.\n\n\"I looked down and I saw my brother's face on the patient,\" he said.\n\nNate Vandegrift, his younger brother, had been hit by a commercial van crossing the street. Josh Vandegrift began to treat his brother before being removed from the scene by police officers. \"I remember just absolutely losing it in the middle of the road.\"\n\nNate Vandegrift died about eight hours after the accident. Since then, Josh Vandegrift has had nightmares and flashbacks. He avoids the intersection if possible.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Vandegrift with PTSD. He took his sick time and vacation time, and when that ran out, co-workers donated their sick time to him. When that ran out in August 2016, he applied for workers' compensation. His claim was denied.\n\n\"I had to go back to work or resign, basically,\" said Vandegrift, who returned to work. \"I have good days, and I have really bad days, and everything in between. Every day, I walk through a different part of hell and have to figure out how to navigate it.\"\n\nVandegrift, one of dozens of first responders who have answered WMFE and ProPublica's request to hear from first responders suffering from PTSD, won't benefit from the new law. The legislation will cover people who make a workers' comp claim after Oct. 1, 2018, as long as the triggering event was within the prior year.\n\nThat means Parkland first responders could be covered, but not Vandegrift and responders to the Pulse nightclub shooting. Vandegrift said he knew before he started advocating for the law that it likely wouldn't apply to him.\n\n\"If anything happens in the future, something is in place now so nobody will have to go through what I went through,\" Vandegrift said. \"You know, to be able to get out of bed in the morning.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

So much Hennessy is being sold, in fact, that one New Hampshire official is asking state Attorney General Gordon MacDonald to investigate whether the Liquor Commission is turning a blind eye to bootlegging and money-laundering activities.\n\nNew Hampshire, despite its pronounced libertarian streak, is one of 17 \"control\" states, meaning the government manages the distribution of spirits. The state's Liquor Commission, which is run by an appointed chairman, oversees 79 retail stores.\n\nAndru Volinsky, a Democrat who serves on the state's five-member Executive Council, an elected body that serves as a kind of watchdog over the executive branch, made the allegations public last month.\n\nAfter being tipped off by a whistleblower, Volinsky says, he recently witnessed two people arriving in a vehicle with New York license plates and spending approximately $24,000 on Hennessy products. At the register, they allegedly divided the sale into three transactions and paid using \"a very large wad of cash.\" He suspects people are buying up large quantities of New Hampshire's tax-free booze to sell elsewhere.\n\nThe IRS requires businesses to document when someone spends more than $10,000 in cash on a single purchase. By allowing customers to break up the transactions, the Liquor Commission may be evading that reporting requirement, Volinsky contends. He is also concerned that the Liquor Commission isn't doing enough to police customers who may stop at multiple stores in a single day to avoid triggering the $10,000 reporting requirement.\n\nThese practices \"may be illegal and unquestionably facilitate money laundering,\" writes Volinsky in a letter to the governor and state attorney general.\n\nLiquor Commission denies allegations\n\nThe New Hampshire Liquor Commission is a cash cow, generating more than $150 million in profits last year that went directly into the state's general fund. These government-run liquor stores are strategically located near the state's borders, including at highway rest stops, where motorists can enjoy tax-free shopping and better prices than in nearby Vermont and Massachusetts.\n\nAccording to publicly available online inventories, those border stores stock huge quantities of Hennessy products. Meanwhile, just a handful of bottles may be on the shelves at stores located far from the border.\n\nIt isn't clear why Hennessy appears to be the brand of choice for bootleggers, but the price difference between New Hampshire's bottles and the highly taxed New York bottles is likely one draw. Also, government officials have offered anecdotal evidence that some of the spirits are headed for Chinese restaurants, as well as gentlemen's clubs in the greater New York City region.\n\n\"I started hearing anecdotes of people coming in with wads of cash stuffed in their socks,\" Volinsky tells New Hampshire Public Radio. \"Wads of cash that smell of perfume because on Wednesdays, apparently the strip club owners in New York come over to buy their liquor in bulk, and the office of the liquor store smells from the perfume.\"\n\nFor its part, the Liquor Commission flatly denies Volinsky's allegations.\n\n\"There's nothing illegal or unscrupulous about making large sales to out-of-state customers as long as our employees follow the policies in place set forth by the state and federal government,\" writes the commission in a statement. It has provided employees with a step-by-step guide to ensure that financial disclosure laws are appropriately followed.\n\nThe commission, along with top Republicans in the state including Gov. Chris Sununu, have gone on the attack, criticizing Volinsky for his \"sting operation,\" and are calling for the attorney general to investigate him.\n\nPrevious investigation\n\nWhile a partisan tit-for-tat was perhaps inevitable, many of the concerns raised by Volinsky are not new to New Hampshire officials or to law enforcement in neighboring states.\n\nIn fact, in 2012, it was a top GOP lawmaker who called for a special House committee to investigate potential wrongdoing within the Liquor Commission, including how it handles large cash purchases.\n\nThat committee's final report included two anecdotes of out-of-state residents arrested in Massachusetts with large hauls of New Hampshire-purchased booze. One of those arrests included 1,676 bottles of Hennessy, bought at multiple locations. The driver was charged with possessing untaxed liquor and unlawfully transporting liquor.\n\nMore recently, liquor enforcement officials in Vermont have made two arrests, one involving an estimated $40,000 worth of New Hampshire-purchased liquor in the back of an SUV, the other with an estimated $28,000 worth. Both suspects were charged with crossing state lines in possession of more than 9 liters of alcohol, Vermont's current legal limit.\n\n\"The product that was the most prominent in both of these cases was Hennessy cognac,\" says Patrick Delaney, Vermont's commissioner of liquor control, who backs increasing the financial penalties for those caught illegally importing large quantities of liquor. He adds that \"by using cash, there is obviously no paper trail, if an authority were to investigate it. The activity itself is basically tax evasion.\"\n\nAn IRS spokesperson says the agency is \"aware of this and similar schemes\" but wouldn't confirm any active investigation into all-cash bulk transactions in New Hampshire.\n\nPotential repercussions\n\nPoliticians are not the only ones asking questions. Some employees of New Hampshire liquor stores are raising concerns about their role in processing these transactions.\n\n\"They are starting to feel like a drug dealer,\" says Richard Gulla, president of the State Employees Association, the union that represents rank-and-file liquor store employees.\n\nTo handle the huge stacks of cash and speed up transactions, the Liquor Commission has installed 20 bill-counting machines at stores around the state and says it plans to roll out more units.\n\nVolinsky sees these steps and others taken by the Liquor Commission as \"alarming.\"\n\nThe state attorney general's office says it is reviewing the documents submitted by Volinsky and isn't yet able to comment on their content.\n\nNHPR's Casey McDermott contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["hennessy", "liquor", "york", "hampshire", "commission", "state", "stores", "taxfree", "selling", "cash", "large", "hampshires", "volinsky"], "polarity": 0.12165384777035265, "subjectivity": 0.43873050897322724},

And Hispanic-American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\"\n\nEarier this month, he also bragged about the latest jobs report, focusing in on minorities in particular.\n\nOn Twitter he cited that black unemployment is \"the lowest ever recorded in our country.\" And he jabbed: \"Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!\"\n\nAnd then at a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation, he did it again, saying, \"African-American unemployment is the lowest it's ever been in the history of our records.\"\n\nPresidents often take credit for a strong economy, and Trump fits that mold, touting jobs and stock market numbers regularly. So we decided to fact-check Trump on this claim: Is he right, and are these numbers his doing?\n\nThe claim\n\nBlack and Hispanic unemployment are at or near record lows.\n\nThe short answer\n\nTrump's numbers are right, but it's generally a stretch for presidents to take credit for job creation.\n\nThe long answer\n\nTrump is right that African-American unemployment hit a record low in December. The unemployment rate for black Americans is currently 6.8 percent, the lowest level recorded since the government started keeping track in January 1972.\n\nAnd he's also right that the Hispanic unemployment rate is down a point over the last year \u2014 it was at 4.9 percent in December, down from 5.9 percent in December 2016. That is close to a record low, though it's also up 0.1 point from November.\n\nBut still, fact check: true on Trump's numbers.\n\nHowever, that's not all Trump is doing in this tweet. He is implying that he caused these low African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates.\n\nAnd a big problem with that claim is that those rates had been falling for long before Trump took office, and their declines don't appear to have picked up speed. This implies that there's nothing specific that Trump did to change this rate.\n\nIndeed, both of these rates have been falling relatively steadily since around 2010, early in President Obama's tenure in the White House.\n\nSo have the unemployment rates for all races and ethnic groups tracked by the Labor Department. In general, these unemployment rates tend to move together. So while Trump called out the African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates, they haven't changed in any remarkable way, relative to other groups' unemployment rates.\n\nSeparately, the president's Council of Economic Advisers touted the unemployment rate of other demographic groups on Friday, shortly after the latest jobs report was released.\n\n\"The overall unemployment rate, which by October had dropped to 4.1 percent, represented a 17-year low by year's end,\" they wrote. \"The benefits of the low rates were felt broadly, resulting in unemployment rates for America's veterans, African-Americans and Hispanics that reached historic lows in 2017.\"\n\nThe total unemployment rate is quite low, at 4.1 percent. That's not a record, but for comparison with that African-American rate, it is near its lowest point since 1972.\n\nSo Trump here is trying to make a political point \u2014 one that he has made before \u2014 seeming to tell minorities that they should support him more than they do. But then, the president has a decidedly uneasy relationship with black Americans, as NPR's Brakkton Booker wrote on Saturday, and his rhetoric on immigration has also upset some Hispanics.\n\nThis leads to the bigger question of how much Trump has to do with any of this job growth, regardless of race or ethnicity.\n\nBy the jobs numbers themselves, it doesn't look like he has changed much here. In fact, the average job creation in Trump's first year is slightly lower than it has been in prior years. Employers added 171,000 new jobs each month, on average, in 2017. In 2016, that figure was 187,000, and in 2015, it was 226,000.\n\nIt is possible that the tax plan that Trump recently signed into law will inspire employers to hire more. Businesses could conceivably plow some of the money they save on their taxes thanks to that plan into job creation. In a late-November Yahoo poll of more than 1,200 business owners, half said the new tax plan would make them more likely to hire.\n\nThen again, a majority of economists polled by the University of Chicago predict that long term, the tax plan won't lead to higher economic growth.\n\nIt's not that Trump has had zero effect on the economy. Though a strong global economy has been the main reason stocks are climbing ever higher, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in December, the president's agenda of deregulation and cutting corporate taxes has also likely very played some part in pushing stocks ever higher.\n\nBut the case that Trump has therefore significantly boosted job creation through the stock market isn't particularly strong, says one economist.\n\n\"To the extent that that affects business decisions, it may be that the president is having some impact on employment,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"But it's very important not to overstate that.\"\n\nThere's also a bigger problem with the idea that Trump has created all these jobs \u2014 presidents don't have much immediate control over the economy, period.\n\nIt's true that they push policies or make hires that can affect economic performance \u2014 George W. Bush first appointed former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who helmed the central bank as it worked to pull the country out of recession; and President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus. It's also true that at the end of any given president's tenure, we look at the job market under that president.\n\nBut there's so much about the economy that presidents don't control \u2014 business cycles and other countries' economic health, for example. The White House also can't control broader macroeconomic trends, like the U.S. economy's long-term shift from goods-producing to service-based industries.\n\nIndeed, a 2015 paper from Princeton economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson found that while the economy has tended to grow faster under Democratic presidents, policy actions don't appear to account for that difference.\n\n\"Democrats would probably like to attribute a large portion of the D-R growth gap to better fiscal (and perhaps monetary) policies, but the data do not support such a claim,\" they wrote.\n\nSo could a president \u2014 with Congress' help \u2014 target communities with particularly high unemployment? Yes, says one expert \u2014 particularly in one policy area Trump already has been championing.\n\n\"There needs to be a deliberate attempt to retrain and recruit people into the economy through infrastructure programs,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate is relatively low \u2014 near what economists call \"full employment\" \u2014 it remains true that the black unemployment rate is always much higher than the national rate. He believes that targeted infrastructure policy could reduce that gap, helping disadvantaged Americans get back to work.\n\n\"Full employment means nothing to black folk in Baltimore or St. Louis or Pittsburgh,\" Perry said. \"For far too long, black unemployment has been the sacrificial lamb of full employment, and so again, if there is an infrastructure plan put on the table, it should be targeted at populations in areas that are largely out of work. [And] not only inner-city black America; it's also rural white men who are being left behind by the economy.\"\n\nIf that's true, it seems likely to remain a hypothetical. Democrats and Republicans alike champion the idea of infrastructure, but partisan divides on how to do it remain so wide that passing an infrastructure package this year would most likely be a heavy lift.", "keywords": ["black", "rates", "unemployment", "economy", "low", "fact", "check", "president", "rate", "job", "hispanics", "presidents", "africanamericans", "trump", "touts"], "polarity": 0.10759792185928543, "subjectivity": 0.41548236906191444},

Despite the influx of women interested in political office, men still dominate most leadership roles in the United States.\n\nFewer than 1 in 5 members of Congress are women. At Fortune 500 companies, fewer than 1 in 20 CEOs are women. And if you look at all the presidents of the United States through Donald Trump, what are the odds of having 45 presidents who are all men?\n\nIf men and women had an equal shot at the White House, the odds of this happening just by chance are about 1 in 36 trillion.\n\nWhat explains the dearth of women in top leadership positions? Is it bias, a lack of role models, the old boy's club? Sure. But it goes even deeper. Research suggests American women are trapped in a paradox that is deeply embedded in our culture.\n\n\"It is really the very, very fine line of being a shrew on one hand and a puppet on the other that any woman in public life has to walk,\" says former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, a Democrat from Illinois.\n\nSo what's a woman to do? Be nice and kind and friendly, as our gender stereotypes about women require? Or be tough and decisive, as our stereotypes about leadership demand? To be one is to be seen as nice, but weak.

This changes you as a person.\n\nRamirez says first responders were overwhelmed with victims who had what he called \"battlefield\" injuries.\n\n\"All of them with major traumatic injuries,\" he said. \"As you can imagine, these small-frame, small-bodied, high school children taking these large caliber weapons \u2014 multiple rounds, to the torso, legs, arms, extremity.\"\n\nThey transported 14 people to the hospital.

It often isn't diagnosed immediately after a tragedy.\n\nBeing hyper vigilant and startling easily are normal reactions to experiencing or witnessing trauma like the Parkland scene. It becomes a disorder if the symptoms don't subside in a month or two, or start causing trouble at home or at work.\n\nRight now, Florida law allows first responders to get medical coverage under workers' compensation if they get PTSD on the job. But if they need time off for treatment, or if the PTSD becomes disabling, they must also have a physical injury to have their salaries covered.\n\nA bill to address that failed last year, and was on an uncertain path before Parkland.\n\nCarlos Guillermo Smith, who represents Orlando in Florida's state legislature, supports it.\n\n\"Many of the first responders from the mass shooting in Parkland are going to need this bill,\" he said during a recent committee debate. \"Some of them probably don't even know it yet.\"\n\nUntil now, the bill's main sticking point had been financial. The Florida League of Cities estimated it would cost between $15 million and $95 million to include PTSD as a qualifying condition for workers' comp, assuming first responders take between six months and a year off to recover. The organization cited the price tag as it lobbied against the bill.\n\nThat drew an angry rebuke from Jimmy Patronis, Florida's chief financial officer who is also the state's fire marshal. In a statement, Patronis called the League's opposition to the bill \"disgraceful\" and called its report \"wrought with flawed and erroneous data, to support why they don't care about the first responders who make up the communities they represent.\"\n\nAfterwards, David Cruz, a lobbyist with the Florida League of Cities, backed off. His organization now supports the bill.\n\nOne of the most outspoken advocates for change has been Jessica Realin. Her husband Gerry Realin was diagnosed with PTSD after spending at least four hours inside Pulse nightclub, preparing and transporting the 49 dead.\n\nHe was in the heat of summer, wearing a hazmat suit with no helmet, and his boots turned yellow, then red, from the blood and gore.\n\nWhen Jessica Realin heard there were still bodies inside the school the day after the Parkland shooting, she cried. \"It reminded me of my husband, and just him reiterating how they needed to get them out,\" she said.\n\nAbout a year passed before Gerry Realin was granted a disability pension from the Orlando Police Department, outside the Florida workers' compensation system. He sued the department within the state's workers' comp system for about $26,000.\n\nJudge of Compensation Claims Neal Pitts ruled against Realin in January.\n\n\"If he had sustained even a minor accompanying physical injury, he would be entitled to both medical and indemnity benefits,\" Pitts wrote. \"To change this outcome would require action by the Legislature, should they deem it necessary.\"\n\nFinal votes on that action are set for Monday.\n\nRep. Matt Willhite, one of the legislation's sponsors, is encouraging his fellow lawmakers to pass it so that the death toll attributable to the Parkland attack won't grow to include \"first responders who take their life because of this.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Most are in the country illegally and have been arrested or are under deportation orders. Some have criminal records, several do not.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency most frequently criticized for arresting activists, categorically rejects the accusation that it is singling them out. ICE says it does not retaliate against unlawful immigrants for critical comments they make, and any suggestion to the contrary is \"irresponsible\" and \"speculative.\" ICE says that any individual in violation of immigration laws may be subject to arrest, detention, and removal.\n\nHere are the cases of more than 20 activists and volunteers that have been highlighted by the immigrant advocates:\n\n(Read the full story here.)\n\nMigrant Justice\n\nThis nonprofit in Burlington, Vt., has had six leaders arrested over a period of 14 months. All are undocumented. Migrant Justice advocates for dairy workers in Vermont. The arrested leaders are Victor Garcia Diaz, Alfredo Alcudia Gamas, Enrique Balcazar Sanchez, Zully Palacios Rodriguez, Yesenia Hernandez Ramos, and Esau Peche Ventura. Garcia Diaz has a DUI conviction; none of the others have criminal charges. All have been released and are fighting deportation orders.\n\nNew Sanctuary Coalition of New York City\n\nOn Jan. 3, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Jean Motrevil, a prominent immigrant rights activist from Haiti who co-founded the New Sanctuary Coalition. According to ICE, Motrevil has several felony convictions for cocaine possession and served time in prison. He was ordered deported, but allowed to stay if he checked in with ICE regularly, which he did for the past 15 years. He married a U.S. citizen, had four children, and started a business. Motrevil was deported to Haiti on Jan. 16.\n\nOn Jan. 11, ICE agents arrested Ravi Ragbir, well-known executive director of the New Sanctuary Coalition, during a routine check-in with ICE. Federal agents point out that he was convicted in 2001 of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for processing fraudulent mortgage applications. Ragbir, from Trinidad, was ordered to pay $350,000 in restitution and detained by ICE for two years while he was in deportation proceedings. He was allowed to stay in the U.S. if he checked in regularly with ICE. Last month, after his arrest, a judge halted Ragbir's deportation.\n\nNo More Deaths\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2017, the U.S. attorney's office in Arizona charged nine volunteers for No More Deaths, a humanitarian group in Tucson, with misdemeanors. None of the defendants are undocumented immigrants. The organization works to reduce deaths of immigrants illegally crossing the border and trekking through the Sonoran Desert, chiefly by leaving caches of drinking water. The federal civil charges include entering the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge without a permit, and operating a motor vehicle in a wilderness area. Hours after No More Deaths released a controversial video showing Border Patrol agents kicking over water jugs, volunteer Scott Daniel Warren was arrested and charged with harboring undocumented immigrants, a felony. The other defendants are Natalie Renee Hoffman, Oona Meagan Holcomb, Madeline Abbe Huse, Zaachila I. Orozco-McCormick, Caitlin Persis Deighan, Zoe E. Anderson, Logan Thomas Hollarsmith, and Rebecca Katie Grossman-Richeimer.\n\nEliseo Jurado Fernandez\n\nOn Jan. 11, ICE agents arrested Jurado, an undocumented Mexican national, outside a Denver supermarket. He is married to Ingrid Encalada Latorre, a Peruvian woman who received publicity for seeking sanctuary in three Colorado churches to avoid deportation. ICE says Jurado came to the agency's attention while it was investigating his spouse. Jurado has a DUI conviction, as well as misdemeanor convictions for driving without a license and giving false information to a police officer. He was released from detention last month pending deportation orders.\n\nBaltazar Aburto Gutierrez\n\nICE agents arrested the Mexican shellfish worker in Ocean Park, Wash., in December 2017, after he was quoted in a newspaper complaining about his longtime partner's deportation to Mexico. According to the Seattle Times, Gutierrez said the arresting agent told him, \"You are the one from the newspaper.\" Aburto has no criminal record. An immigration judge lowered his bond in January, saying he poses no danger to the public.\n\nAlejandra Pablos\n\nPablos is an anti-Trump immigrant activist and field coordinator for the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health in Virginia. On March 7, agents detained her after she flew to Arizona for an ICE check-in. She was convicted in Tucson of driving under the influence. Though she had a green card, the DUI conviction makes her deportable. She remains detained in southern Arizona.\n\nClaudia Rueda\n\nClaudia Rueda is an immigration activist and college student who protested U.S. deportation policies, as well as the arrest of her mother on drug smuggling charges. Rueda was arrested by immigration agents on May 18, 2017, and released 22 days later. She claims her detention was motivated by retaliation to silence her. A supervisory Border Patrol agent told the Los Angeles Times that they had identified Rueda as \"part of a support network\" for a drug organization. Her mother was never charged on narcotics offenses but she was held on immigration violations.\n\nDaniela Vargas\n\nOn March 1, 2017, a 22-year-old immigrant activist from Argentina named Daniela Vargas was leaving a rally in Jackson, Miss., where she had spoken in favor of undocumented rights. ICE pulled over the car she was riding in and arrested her because her DACA status had expired. Vargas, who was brought to the U.S. as a child, had received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which grants her a temporary work permit and protection from deportation. She says she had applied to renew it. She was detained for 10 days and released.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Valdes/AP Manuel Valdes/AP\n\nMaru Mora Villalpando\n\nOn Dec. 20, 2017, ICE told Villalpando to appear in immigration court to face deportation.

Everybody.\"\n\nThe president noted that his efforts to renegotiate NAFTA continue as well. \"We are renegotiating NAFTA as I said I would, and if we don't make a deal I will terminate NAFTA,\" he warned.\n\nCongress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter Trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.\n\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, David Reichert, R-Wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. They are seeking additional signatures from House Republicans. Aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader GOP can get behind.\n\n\"As the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and Congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for American businesses and consumers,\" Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.\n\nSenate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. Hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the GOP's tax cuts. \"Should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, American manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. Such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books,\" Hatch said in a weekend statement.\n\nThe White House showed no indication Monday that the president was considering changing his mind. \"The president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen,\" said National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, a top Trump aide who, along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.\n\n\"Understand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on K Street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the American worker and on behalf of the country,\" Navarro said. \"This is a very well-informed decision.\"\n\nTrump's decision is the starkest break from traditional GOP economic philosophy on trade since taking office. The president has found few GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but Rust Belt Democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. \"This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,\" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Likewise, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., called Trump's decision a \"welcome step.\"\n\nRepublicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. Republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports \u2014 a message they delivered directly to Trump in several recent meetings. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when Trump made the announcement.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it because I've been in meetings with him on trade,\" Thune told reporters. \"Everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like China for dumping low-cost steel in the American market. Graham said Sunday that Trump would \"let China off the hook\" while punishing U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. \"The reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of China dumping,\" Graham said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. \"China produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. China is your problem, Mr. President.\"\n\nCongress technically has legislative options to counter Trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of Republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. Republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. And any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade.", "keywords": ["lobby", "congressional", "tax", "trade", "week", "republicans", "tariffs", "china", "house", "steel", "trump", "president"], "polarity": 0.0802776828434723, "subjectivity": 0.35740715424925945},

The music got louder. \"I guess my time is up,\" Feinstein conceded as what sounded like a 1940s movie score continued playing.\n\nWithout missing a beat, supporters of her opponent, state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n echoed her statement in a chant: \"Your time is up! Your time is up!\" \u2014 a not-so-subtle reference to Feinstein's 25 years in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIt was a sign of things to come. The grass-roots Democratic activists gathered at the party's annual convention in San Diego this weekend implicitly rebuked the state's senior U.S. senator by denying her the party's endorsement for her re-election bid.\n\nFeinstein finished far behind de Le\u00f3n, the top Democrat in the state Senate. De Le\u00f3n received 54 percent of delegates' votes to just 37 percent for Feinstein. It takes 60 percent to receive an endorsement.\n\nWhile the lack of an endorsement certainly won't keep Feinstein off the ballot, it's a sign that grass-roots Democrats are eager to supplant leaders who are seen as too moderate and willing to compromise.\n\nDemocratic Party activists have never really been Feinstein's people. In 1990, when she was running for governor, she came to the party convention and expressed her support for the death penalty, eliciting boos from the liberal crowd. She lost the party endorsement to John Van de Kamp but got the nomination anyway, ultimately losing the November election to Pete Wilson.\n\nFeinstein has always been a little to the right of where the party's activists are. Now, at age 84 and in her final campaign, Feinstein is once again at odds with progressives, despite her efforts to move left by more strongly opposing President Trump's agenda.\n\nShe said the Senate Appropriations Committee, which she sits on, would never approve $25 billion for Trump's wall along the Mexico border. But minutes later, de Le\u00f3n's team sent texts noting that Feinstein had just voted for exactly that as part of the \"Common Sense Coalition\" immigration plan that failed to get through the Senate.\n\nThe bill would not only have provided a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, people in the U.S. illegally who were brought here as children, but it also included $25 billion for the wall.\n\nFeinstein also reminded the crowd of her longstanding leadership on gun control, including her success against long odds at getting an assault weapons ban signed into law in 1994.\n\nIn his speech to the convention, de Le\u00f3n reminded the crowd that his opponent hasn't always been a reliable liberal. \"Democrats, you'll never have to guess where I stand,\" de Le\u00f3n said before noting that he has championed issues such as raising the minimum wage, single-payer health care and the environment.\n\n\"Moral clarity is always doing the right thing when no one is watching,\" he said. \"And it should never take a primary challenge to stand up for California values.\"\n\nAs leader of the state Senate, De Le\u00f3n has had his own problems of late, most notably criticism of his slow response to the sexual harassment scandal in Sacramento. And while an endorsement from the Democratic Party would have provided a boost, his campaign is also overshadowed by Feinstein's huge advantages in name recognition and campaign cash. A recent poll from the Public Policy Institute of California had her leading de Le\u00f3n by 46 percent to 17 percent.\n\nDespite the boost for De Le\u008f\u00f3n, the vote is in some ways a loss for him. Democratic campaign strategist Katie Merrill says he needed the endorsement much more than Feinstein.\n\n\"He was such a narrow path to the Senate, and he had to have this Democratic Party endorsement,\" she said. \"This was the one strategic thing he need to accomplish here and he did not accomplish it.\"", "keywords": ["endorsement", "democratic", "sen", "endorse", "le\u00f3n", "democrats", "dianne", "convention", "campaign", "state", "senate", "decline", "california", "term", "feinstein", "party"], "polarity": 0.09360119047619048, "subjectivity": 0.5169047619047618},

And federal officials deny allegations of retaliation.\n\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups say they have documented two dozen cases of immigrant activists and volunteers who say they have been arrested or face fines for their work.\n\nThey say many of the activists who are undocumented don't have criminal records and only came to the attention of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their activism.\n\nSee the list of the 20+ immigration activists arrested here.\n\n\"We're always at the marches and giving interviews, without fear of what could happen,\" says Zully Palacios Rodriguez, one of the activists caught by ICE. \"So to go against us is a way to intimidate the community.\"\n\nSeveral of the arrests have garnered national and international attention.\n\nTwo of the undocumented activists who have been arrested and put in deportation proceedings have filed First Amendment lawsuits claiming their free speech rights have been violated.\n\nIn one of those cases, the United Nations Office of Human Rights waded into the controversy, calling on the U.S. government \"to guarantee that no action, including detention and deportation, as a means of retaliation, is taken against\" the activist.\n\nOne of the groups crying foul is Migrant Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for dairy workers in Vermont. Six of its undocumented leaders have been arrested and face deportation.\n\nAt a recent protest against ramped-up deportations under President Trump, a dozen demonstrators stand amid piles of dirty snow in the town of Richford, Vt., not far from the Canada border.\n\nNational Immigrant Advocates Claim ICE Is Targeting And Deporting Them For Speaking Out Immigrant Advocates Claim ICE Is Targeting And Deporting Them For Speaking Out Listen \u00b7 5:36 5:36\n\nNational Activists: 1st Amendment Rights Of Undocumented Immigrants Are Often Violated Activists: 1st Amendment Rights Of Undocumented Immigrants Are Often Violated Listen \u00b7 3:23 3:23\n\n\"Not one more! Not one more!\" they chant.\n\nPalacios is 24, from Peru, and undocumented. As a high-profile spokeswoman for Migrant Justice, she thinks that's why they targeted her. Wearing a pink knit cap pulled down against the cold, she steps up to speak in Spanish into a microphone.\n\n\"I, too, am a victim of attacks by ICE,\" she says.\n\nPalacios and another prominent Migrant Justice leader, Enrique Balcazar Sanchez, were arrested a year ago when driving away from the organization's headquarters in Burlington.\n\nICE agents had taken down their names during an earlier arrest of another colleague. The agents investigated and learned that Palacios had overstayed a student visa, and that Balcazar had entered the country illegally from Mexico to work on dairy farms. Neither Palacios nor Balcazar have criminal records.\n\n\"There are six cases in particular where it's quite clear that the cause of the arrest was because of the members' leadership in the organization,\" says Will Lambek, national spokesman for the organization.\n\nHe ticks off reasons he believes the leaders were targeted. During one arrest, he says, federal agents warned that they'd be back to apprehend another Migrant Justice director.\n\nIn another arrest, ICE noted in the charging document that the subject \u2014 who had a DUI conviction \u2014 is \"a member and associate of Migrant Justice, a local immigrant advocate group.\"\n\nICE flatly denies that activists from Migrant Justice and other pro-immigrant groups are being singled out.\n\n\"ICE does not target unlawfully present aliens for arrest based on advocacy positions they hold or in retaliation for critical comments they make,\" Matthew Albence, executive associate director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement. \"Any suggestion to the contrary is irresponsible, speculative and inaccurate.\n\n\"All those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to arrest, detention and ... removal from the United States.\"\n\nIn an email to NPR, an ICE spokesman for the region that includes Vermont, wrote: \"Professional activists string together tenuous pieces of information to justify their campaigning. The allegations are just wrong.\"\n\nDoris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Clinton and now senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, is skeptical that immigration agents would be picking on activists.\n\nShe points out that Trump has given ICE broad new authority to apprehend anybody they come across who's in the country unlawfully.\n\n\"Activists can be swept up in that, just like a variety of other groups that have been unprepared to face deportation,\" she says.\n\nYet, immigrant advocates point to what they call the hostile posture the administration has taken toward anyone standing in the way of its immigration clampdown.\n\n\"It's all of a piece with what this Homeland Security Department has been doing around the country,\" says Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU Immigrant Rights Project. \"You have the attorney general, the secretary of homeland security, and the acting director of ICE all making various threats to sanctuary cities and their officials.\"\n\nHe says it's not a stretch to think immigration agents would target anti-ICE activists who are in the country illegally.\n\nAmong the other cases of immigrant activists facing deportation is Maru Mora-Villalpando, who came from Mexico City to San Francisco in 1996 on a tourist visa, and overstayed. Villalpando became a well-known activist in the Northwest, regularly speaking out against ICE's detention policies.\n\nICE agents say she came to their attention when they read about her in the media accounts that indicated she was undocumented. In December, ICE sent her a letter telling her to appear before an immigration judge to face deportation. She didn't have a criminal record.\n\nIn her charging document, an ICE agent wrote: \"It should also be noted that she has extensive involvement with anti-ICE protests and Latino advocacy programs.\"\n\nThe case came to the attention of the U.N. human rights experts. They wrote in a statement: \"Ms. Villalpando's notice to appear at deportation proceedings, received without warning, seems to be related to her advocacy work on behalf of migrant detainees.\"\n\n\"My first sense was that ICE was trying to send me a signal to stop my work,\" Villalpando says from her home in Bellingham, Washington. \"The public needs to know what's going on.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Villalpando appeared in immigration court in Seattle to make her case before a judge.\n\nVillalpando also has a First Amendment lawsuit pending. The other suit was filed in the case of Ravi Ragbir, director of the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City. He was taken into custody during an ICE check-in in January. ICE says he's in the country illegally, and he was once convicted of wire fraud.\n\nBut that crime was 17 years ago. And they put him into deportation proceedings two months ago.\n\nImmigration groups also point to eight members of a humanitarian group in Tucson called No More Deaths being charged with federal civil violations, such as entering a national wildlife refuge without a permit, and operating a motor vehicle in a wilderness area.\n\nThey are not undocumented immigrants. They are volunteers from all over the country who leave jugs of water in the desert for immigrants crossing the border illegally.\n\nArrests of Vermont dairy workers began in the Obama years, and they've accelerated under Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nAt the Richford protest, Balcazar, the Mexican immigrant arrested with Palacios, says the apprehensions of Migrant Justice leaders have sent a fresh chill through the immigrant community.\n\n\"They prefer to keep quiet,\" he says. \"They don't come out as much to our meetings and demonstrations. They prefer not to expose themselves and risk deportation.\"\n\nIndeed, the only Migrant Justice members to attend the meager protest at the health clinic were the leaders who'd already been arrested.\n\nSince its founding nine years ago, Migrant Justice has grown into a formidable advocate for the undocumented in Vermont. They pushed for drivers licenses for immigrants, and recently convinced Ben & Jerry's to improve working conditions in dairies.\n\nAt a recent city council meeting in tiny Winooski, Vt., you could witness the influence they wield.\n\nBalcazar drove here straight from the health clinic protest.\n\n\"We want to live in safety,\" he says to the council members. \"We're often forced to live in the shadows. We don't trust the police.\"\n\nHis organization wants to build on the success it has had on the state level. Migrant Justice was a major player behind the scenes when the Vermont Assembly passed a law last year that restricts local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Some now consider Vermont a sanctuary state.\n\nOn this night, activists and citizens have come to convince the city council to pass an even stricter ordinance to stop local police from dealing with ICE. They found a receptive audience.\n\n\"We are not going to utilize City of Winooski resources to grant access to those individuals who are in our custody to immigration enforcement authorities,\" says Councilor Eric Covey.\n\nAt the end of the public comments period, the council votes unanimously to adopt the measure proposed by Migrant Justice and the ACLU of Vermont.", "keywords": ["advocates", "warn", "activists", "justice", "immigrant", "deportation", "activism", "migrant", "undocumented", "country", "retaliating", "ice", "vermont", "immigration"], "polarity": -0.042456826327794066, "subjectivity": 0.35934103232490333},

With tax reform moving quickly through Congress, confidence in the strength of our economy remains high and families around the country are reaping the benefits. We're especially pleased to see the manufacturing sector roaring back to life, adding a total of 159,000 jobs since President Trump took office after averaging a loss of more than 1,000 jobs per month during the last year of the previous administration. As we continue to unleash the American economy from unnecessary regulation and taxes, we look forward to seeing more reports like this, showing a healthy and thriving jobs market for the American people.\"\n\n\u2014 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\nThe Labor Department reports that U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in November, somewhat better than analysts had been expecting. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1 percent. Job gains in manufacturing were especially strong with 31,000 added last month.\n\nThe president boasted about it on Twitter.\n\nIt's difficult to tie those gains directly to President Trump's economic vision, however. On average, employers have added 170,000 jobs in each of the 10 months since Trump took office. That's slightly below the 196,000 per month pace during the comparable period in 2016, under President Obama. If you throw out September of this year, when job gains were depressed by hurricanes, Trump's monthly average is closer to Obama's, at 185,000, but the change in administrations doesn't appear to have had much effect on the overall job market.\n\nThe job gains in November were widespread across industries and demographic groups.\n\n\"We're at that point in the cycle where the market is tight enough that it's really rewarding everybody,\" said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nHe noted that unemployment among workers without a high school diploma fell by half a percentage point to 5.2 percent. And the jobless rate among Hispanics dipped to 4.7 percent, the lowest level on record.\n\n\"If we could sustain growth at this level for another couple of years then the amount of progress we could make on income inequality and wage growth for middle America would be maybe even unprecedented,\" Hassett said.\n\nDespite the tight labor market, though, wages have risen only modestly in the past year.\n\n\"Wage growth was not as strong as we'd like to see it,\" Hassett acknowledged. \"We fully expect that that's going to accelerate next year if the tax bill passes.\"\n\nTom Maher, who runs a Manpower temporary franchise in Dayton, Ohio, agreed that paychecks need to get bigger.\n\n\"Wages are rising, but they're not rising as fast as I believe they really should in order to attract the workers that they need,\" Maher said. \"Virtually every manufacturer in the area has a help-wanted sign outside their window.\"\n\nFactories nationwide have added 171,000 jobs so far in 2017 \u2014 a rebound from the previous year when factories shed 16,000 jobs. Trump has promised to lead a renaissance in American manufacturing. The sector has generally been adding jobs since 2010, although the strength of export-oriented factories is strongly tied to what's happening in the global economy.\n\nWith the unemployment rate hovering at its lowest level since 2000, a shortage of skilled workers could be a drag on future economic growth.\n\n\"There is some slack in the labor market,\" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG. \"But there's a big question about whether that remaining slack in the labor market can be deployed.\"\n\n\"What I expect is we will start to see increasing labor shortages as we go into 2018. And at some point \u2014 and it may be late 2018, it may be mid 2019 \u2014 those labor shortages are going to really limit the ability we have to continue expanding.\"\n\nAt a White House Cabinet meeting this week, Trump said he wants to draw more people into the workforce.\n\n\"We're also getting into the pool of the 100 million people that are not working,\" Trump said. \"That pool is now coming back.\"\n\nAccording to the Labor Department, there are 95 million Americans 16 and older who are not working. But that figure includes retirees, students and voluntary stay-at-home parents. It's an open question how many might be lured into the workforce. Lower taxes might offer a carrot to would-be workers. The administration is also considering sticks \u2014 in the form of a less generous safety net.\n\n\"I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn't work at all,\" the president told supporters in Missouri last week. \"And the person who is not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that's working his or her ass off. And it's not going to happen. Not going to happen.\"\n\nThis week the Agriculture Department announced a push to limit the food stamp program \u2014 known as SNAP \u2014 in an effort to push more people into the workforce.\n\n\"SNAP was created to provide people with the help they need to feed themselves and their families, but it was not intended to be a permanent lifestyle,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. \"We want to provide the nutrition people need, but we also want to help them transition from government programs back to work and into lives of independence.\"\n\nThe White House had telegraphed this move in May when the president unveiled a budget calling for cuts in food stamp spending.\n\n\"We need folks to work,\" White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said at the time. \"We don't have enough money to take care of the people \u2014 everybody \u2014 who doesn't need help.\"\n\nAs of August, there were more than 41 million Americans receiving food stamps. Advocates for the program note that the government already requires able-bodied adults without children to find work within three months to collect benefits.\n\nTrump also boasted this week about the rising stock market.\n\n\"We have a stock market that has hit record highs 81 times since our election victory,\" he told Cabinet members. \"It's at a new high right now.\"\n\nThe S&P 500-stock index has risen more than 23 percent since Election Day last year. Along with a rising real estate market, that's helped to push the nation's total household wealth to $96.9 trillion. However, as NPR noted last spring, only about half the people in the country own stocks either directly or through retirement accounts.\n\n\"You could argue that there's a trickle-down effect,\" said KPMG's Hunter, \"but actual evidence of that meaningfully changing people's lives over the long term seems to be de minimis.\"", "keywords": ["market", "workers", "labor", "white", "need", "jobs", "check", "trumps", "working", "trump", "record", "stocks", "work", "fact", "president"], "polarity": 0.13331213924963922, "subjectivity": 0.37007835046897536},

Teacher Liliana Reyes is reviewing the systems of the body \u2014 circulatory, respiratory and so on \u2014 to prepare them for an upcoming exam.\n\nThese students are seeking to join a workforce of about 3 million people who help older adults remain in their homes. They assist these clients with things like bathing, dressing, and taking medication on time.\n\nAbout a quarter of these workers are immigrants. But as Congress and the White House consider changes to immigration policy, some people in the home care industry worry that there won't be enough people to care for the nation's growing number of elders.\n\nWhat makes the Albuquerque class unusual is that it's taught entirely in Spanish. All of the students are immigrants, mostly from Mexico. The course is a joint project of Central New Mexico Community College and a community education center for immigrants called Encuentro. Everyone who passes the course becomes a state-certified home health aide.\n\nBut some of these students already care for older adults, even though they've lacked training. Zoila Gutierrez says the first job she had in this field paid $6 an hour for a shift that lasted from 7 at night to 7 in the morning.\n\n\"This course is going to open a lot of doors for me in terms of being able to get better work,\" she says. \"But most importantly, I want to know about all the rules that I must follow to provide good care.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ina Jaffe/NPR Ina Jaffe/NPR\n\nGutierrez has a complicated life. She's 42 years old and came to Albuquerque from Mexico in 2004. She doesn't have papers. Her youngest child is a citizen. Her two older kids are both registered under DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. So, at the same time she's studying to improve her prospects in the United States, she and her children also discuss the possibility of going back to Mexico.\n\n\"We must have a Plan B,\" she says. \"We don't want to give up our dreams, but we must think in the 'What if?' So, no, we don't want to leave. But it's an option.\"\n\nWhile Gutierrez worries about the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, others working in home care worry about the administration's proposals for restricting legal immigrants.\n\nPresident Trump wants to focus on highly skilled, well-educated workers. But the policy change that would hurt the home care industry the most would be limiting family reunification, sometimes called chain migration. That's according to Robyn Stone, senior vice president for research at Leading Age, which represents the nonprofit side of long-term care.\n\n\"This immigrant population primarily came to the United States through family reunification,\" says Stone. \"If we shift in our policy [on] immigration, the pipeline for this workforce could be substantially affected.\"\n\nThat's not just a theoretical concern for Sherwin Sheik. He's the founder and CEO of a company called CARELINX, which he describes as a cross between Uber and Match.com for connecting home care workers with clients.\n\n\"It takes a very special person to want to do these jobs,\" Sheik says. \"They tend to be immigrants. If we have tighter policies, it's going to impact the industry, without a doubt.\"\n\nThe nation's rapidly aging population has made personal care assistants and home health aides (who have more specialized training around health issues) the fastest growing low-skilled occupations in the U.S.\n\nBut Steven Camerota isn't worried about a shortage in home care workers. He's the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for restrictions on immigration. He points out that, despite the growing immigrant workforce, three-quarters of the people currently providing home care were born in the U.S.\n\nThere's no mystery to what it would take to increase that percentage, says Camerota. \"Raise wages. Treat workers better.\"\n\nHome care workers sometimes make as little as $10 an hour. At the same time, he says, \"we have an enormous supply of less-educated [American citizens] currently not working who could easily fill these jobs if employers treat them reasonably well.\"\n\nBut this work isn't just a matter of money for Zoila Guttierrez. She finds meaning in taking care of older people.\n\n\"I like to care for them and make sure they're doing well \u2014 that they're OK,\" she says.\n\nIt will take at least a million more people who feel the same way to meet the needs of older adults over the next decade, whether those workers are immigrants or American-born.", "keywords": ["care", "workers", "business", "policy", "students", "shakeup", "threatens", "ina", "health", "immigrants", "older", "workforce", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.16175423061786698, "subjectivity": 0.40005378459923896},

Today, many of us celebrate by going out drinking and acting out the very stereotypes the day was created to combat.\n\nOn the other hand, 150 years ago nativists in the U.S. were burning Irish Catholic churches to the ground. Today on St. Patrick's Day, Americans of all backgrounds wear green, drink Guinness, and put on pins that say \"Kiss me I'm Irish.\" There's something beautiful about that.\n\nIn recent years, holidays associated with various other immigrant groups have begun to gain mainstream acceptance, most notably Cinco de Mayo, which has followed a similar path as St. Patrick's Day \u2013 started by activists to celebrate Mexican culture, embraced by people just looking for a good time.\n\nLunar New Year and Dia De Los Muertos are also well on their way.\n\nWhen one culture's holiday becomes everyone's excuse to party, what's gained and what's lost? And how does it feel when it's your holiday?\n\nTo find out, I go to a Chinese New Year party with no Chinese people and a Passover Seder with no Jewish people for this week's episode of The Sporkful podcast. Plus, comedian Jenny Yang offers advice for marketing new holidays:\n\nGentile Passover\n\n\"We're going to read from Exodus tonight,\" explains Tiffany Wang, as she welcomes me to Gentile Passover, an annual gathering she and her sister, Charlene Wang de Chen, host.\n\n\"We don't have a Haggada,\" Tiffany continues, referring to the book Jews use as a guide at Passover Seder, or ritual meal, \"but we know the Passover story because we grew up in a Christian household.\"\n\nThis Gentile Passover tradition began 10 years ago. Charlene was living in Beijing and read about how President Obama was hosting a Passover in the White House. She decided she'd host one, too, which is no surprise if you know how she and Tiffany were raised.\n\nThey're Chinese-American, but every St. Patrick's Day their mom made corned beef, potatoes and cabbage.\n\n\"We love eating,\" says Charlene, \"and we just love learning more about cultures through their food traditions. That's obviously the funnest way to learn about it.\"\n\nCharlene scrambled around Beijing to gather the symbolic foods needed for a Passover Seder \u2013 salt water for tears, bitter herbs for the bitterness of slavery, and of course, matzo (unleavened bread), because Jews were fleeing the Egyptians and didn't have time for our bread to rise. (That last item required a few phone calls to obtain.)\n\nThe first Gentile Passover was a big success.\n\n\"Everyone was so down for it, on an occasion none of them traditionally celebrate, which I thought was awesome,\" Charlene recalls. \"Everyone was bringing this openness.\"\n\nWhen I joined last year's Gentile Passover, I was the only Jewish person in the room. We were joined by Charlene's husband, Tony Chen, Tiffany's fianc\u00e9, and two friends, Tim Cotton and Anne-Laure Py.\n\nThey proudly showed me the two different types of matzo they had purchased, and served me a delicious cocktail made with Campari and Manischewitz, the latter being a Jewish ceremonial wine that is the best wine because it's filled with sugar.\n\nThe cocktail was fantastic, and the menu looked promising. Tiffany and Charlene had prepared matzo ball soup and short ribs, which made me very happy, because I've long advocated replacing the more traditional brisket with short ribs at Passover and all year round.\n\nThere was a beautiful Seder plate, and even though I'm not especially religious myself, I was very impressed with the research and work they had done to respect the holiday's customs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Pashman/NPR Dan Pashman/NPR\n\nI did cringe a bit when they told me they had rugelach, a Jewish pastry, for dessert. Most Jews would not serve rugelach at Passover because it contains leavened bread. Charlene and Tiffany knew that, but, they said, rugelach is delicious. I couldn't argue with that.\n\nWe read the story of the Jews being freed from slavery in Egypt, as recounted in Exodus, and dinner was served. We skipped rituals like dipping parsley in salt water and putting bitter herbs on matzo. And that felt strange.\n\nAt my family's Passover Seder, we use a Haggada written by my wife, Janie, that I love very much. But the part of it I know best is page 21. Because page 21 is where it says, \"Dinner is served.\" From the time we open that book I keep thinking, \"Please get me to page 21!\"\n\nIn other words, I'm often eager to rush through the rituals. At Gentile Passover, I found myself missing them. It turns out those traditions mean more to me than I realized.\n\nAnd while the experience of watching people who aren't Jewish observe their version of customs I grew up with was in some ways strange and unsettling, it was also beautiful.\n\nI wondered about what my great-grandparents, who came to America from Eastern Europe, would think if they saw me celebrating Passover with two Chinese-American Christians, a Chinese-born Muslim, a Sri Lankan-American, and two white European Christians.\n\nThe meal itself was fantastic. The matzo balls were just the right combo of soft on the outside and firm inside, and the short ribs braised in charoset were savory and sweet, reaffirming my belief in their superiority over brisket.\n\nOne key Passover tradition is that you're supposed to ask questions \u2013 big questions like \"What's the point of all this?\" After the meal I asked everyone, when we celebrate other people's holidays, what's gained and what's lost?\n\n\"We're trying to understand other cultures, but in doing that and changing it, you dilute them,\" says Charlene and Tiffany's friend Tim. \"A more pure and authentic Seder would be less accessible to me, who's not Jewish. So this is more accessible to me, but it also does change it. So there's a tension there. While it's very positive that we learn all these things, I can see why some people get worried that if you do that to the final degree, it ceases to exist as its own tradition and it becomes this amorphous globalized thing that doesn't really mean anything.\"\n\n\"Something I've thought about for a long time is, How Chinese are my kids going to be?\" adds Tiffany. \"And the answer is, less than me. And I'm less than my parents. I'm going to marry a Sri Lankan man. My children are going to be Chinese and Sri Lankan, and very American at the same time. So there will be a dilution of our culture. That can feel like something you can mourn. But then whatever we create from that may also be something new and exciting.\"\n\nDan Pashman hosts the James Beard Award-nominated food podcast The Sporkful, which this week features the episode \"Other People's Holidays.\" It's available in Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever you listen.", "keywords": ["charlene", "matzo", "im", "tiffany", "holidays", "seder", "whats", "excuse", "passover", "party", "jewish", "going", "cultures"], "polarity": 0.1609808832122882, "subjectivity": 0.3886656410623352},

Gun policy had already become a central issue in Florida's current legislative session after the shooting. But the effects of the shooting are reaching beyond the state's borders into legislatures across the country.\n\nThere are thousands of gun-related bills in statehouses \u2014 some would expand access to guns by easing permit restrictions and others aim to take guns out of the hands of people with domestic violence convictions, mental health issues or others who pose a threat.\n\nThe recent shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 has pushed some statehouses and state candidates deeper into the gun debate. Some are moving to bury bills that were already in the works, while others are gaining traction on measures that previously languished.\n\nHere's a look at some of what's happening in statehouses across the country.\n\nCalifornia claimed a victory on Tuesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court punted on a Second Amendment case once again. It declined to hear a challenge to that state's 10-day waiting period to buy guns, reaffirming that states have wide authority to set their own gun laws.\n\nKentucky legislators say they won't consider gun control proposals, but a bill allowing teachers and staff to be armed has gained traction, as Louisville Public Radio's Ryland Barton reported. The bill would allow schools to tap teachers and staff as school marshals, as long as they have a conceal-carry permit.\n\nIn Iowa, the Senate advanced a bill one day after the Parkland shooting requiring school districts to create active shooter safety plans, Iowa Public Radio reports. A Senate committee was also considering a bill that would have removed the permit requirement to obtain and carry weapons. The chairperson now says it's a bad time for that legislation.\n\n\"It makes me sick what happened down in Florida, but with that said, I did have the votes to move this thing forward and decided after the communication from the governor ... to pull it off the agenda,\" said Brad Zaun, a Republican from Des Moines suburb Urbandale.\n\nAn Illinois lawmaker has drafted a proposal in response to Florida's shooting to ban so-called \"ghost guns,\" which are assembled by individuals outside a factory or store. Rep. Martin Moylan, a Democrat, says he also plans to file a measure that would ban AR-15s, a popular semi-automatic rifle. As NPR Illinois reports, Moylan says he does not believe this proposal would be an intrusion on Second Amendment rights. \"Just like prohibiting people to drive 100 miles per hour in a car, there has to be rules and control.\"\n\nRepublican Ohio Gov. John Kasich has softened his stance on gun control in recent months and this week called on President Trump to pass \"common-sense gun laws.\" He recounted a conversation with a friend who owns guns on CNN. \"If all of a sudden you couldn't buy an AR-15, what would you lose? Would you feel your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a goddarn AR-15? These are things that have to be looked at and action has to happen,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear what that action will look like in his own state, though. As WOSU reports, there are 22 pieces of legislation related to guns pending in the Ohio legislature, including bills to ban bump stocks and strengthen background checks.\n\nKucinich plans to lobby the state legislature and called for city councils to ban assault-style weapons with high-capacity magazines, WOSU reports. That will be a tough sell, though. Ohio passed a law in 2006, which was upheld by the state Supreme Court, prohibiting cities from passing restrictive gun laws like an assault weapons ban or handgun registration requirements.\n\nKansas' statehouse was considering a bill that would have instituted gun violence restraining orders like California and Washington. The legislators say now is not the right time to talk about guns.\n\nAnd as KCUR's Jim McLean reports, a Kansas congressional candidate Tyler Tannahill drew criticism online after he decided to go through with a giveaway of an AR-15 rifle, similar to the one used in the Florida shooting. Tannahill also touted a training program for arming teachers.\n\nNearly 50 gun-related bills have been introduced in Michigan since January 2017, the Detroit Free Press reports. The majority of those would expand access to guns and have stalled in committees. But Republican Rep. Jim Runestad tells the paper that a two bills dealing with removing guns from people with mental health issues could get a second look from his committee. \"What are we going to do to make sure people who are severely unbalanced are not given access to weapons?\" Runestad said.\n\nIn Idaho, bills to ease gun permitting are moving forward without hesitation. These include allowing anyone 21 or older to carry concealed weapons and allowing any Idaho resident to carry concealed weapons.\n\nIowa Public Radio's Clay Masters, KCUR's Jim McLean, Michigan Radio's Rick Pluta, WCPN's Nick Castele, KBSX's Jimmy Dawson and NPR Illinois' Brian Mackey of NPR's statehouse collaborative contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["gun", "state", "legislation", "weapons", "fresh", "states", "parkland", "guns", "reports", "bill", "shooting", "bills", "ban", "look"], "polarity": 0.036674409601238876, "subjectivity": 0.3701780874951607},

It is a tradition that dates back to the Coolidge administration in the 1920s and was President Trump's and first lady Melania Trump's first time taking part in the event since moving into the White House.\n\nThe ceremony comes a day after the president reiterated a pledge he's echoed many times since becoming a candidate in 2015 to end the so-called war on Christmas. At a speech Wednesday in Missouri to publicize the GOP tax overhaul expected to come up for a vote in the Senate this week, President Trump kicked off his remarks by saying: \"I told you that we would be saying Merry Christmas again, right?\"\n\nHere's a closer look at the president's claim.\n\nCLAIM: President Trump will return the phrase Merry Christmas to the White House\n\n\"With Trump as your president, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it's going to be done with a big, beautiful tax cut.\"\n\nWhile it is still unclear if congressional Republicans can deliver that tax overhaul Trump is so eager to sign into law, checking to see if \"Merry Christmas\" actually left presidential vernacular is a bit easier to answer.\n\nFirst a little context.\n\nPresident Trump's charge that \"you don't see Merry Christmas anymore\" appeared to be directed at his predecessor former President Barack Obama and the apparent claim that Obama seemed to favor the more inclusive seasonal phrase \"Happy Holidays.\"\n\nSome of those who share President Trump's view of the previous administration point to the Obama White House's official holiday cards that read \"Happy Holidays.\" Former Rep. Joe Walsh, who is now a conservative pundit, tweeted Wednesday:\n\n\"The Trump family's first Christmas card contains a word that was noticeably absent from all eight of Obama's Christmas cards: CHRISTMAS!\"\n\nTodd Starnes of Fox News earlier this week penned an article thanking Trump for bringing \"Merry Christmas\" back to the White House.\n\nBut a quick search of the Web and social media returns many examples of when Obama used the phrase \"Merry Christmas.\" In fact, in his weekly address on Christmas Eve 2016, literally the first words out of the former president's mouth were: \"Merry Christmas, everybody.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama in 2016 YouTube\n\nHere are tweeted photos from the prior years:\n\nIn 2015, Obama tweeted \"Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and yours.\"\n\nIn 2014, Obama tweeted \"Have a merry Christmas.\"\n\nAnd in 2013, Obama went with a simple \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\nAs one journalist pointed out on social media this week, the Obama administration said \"Merry Christmas\" annually for eight years.\n\nWell, perhaps Trump was suggesting the George W.

Republican Men\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption George Frey/Getty Images George Frey/Getty Images\n\nGuns have dominated politics this week. And the one idea President Trump keeps coming back to is arming teachers.\n\nBut a new NPR/Ipsos poll found that really only one group of people are in favor of training teachers to carry guns in schools \u2014 Republicans, especially Republican men.\n\nOverall, 59 percent of Americans are opposed to arming teachers, according to the poll.\n\nBut about two-thirds (68 percent) of Republicans are in favor of it.\n\nRepublican men, in particular, poll the highest of every subgroup \u2014 71 percent of them would like to see teachers armed.\n\nRepublican women also like the idea \u2014 64 percent are in favor.\n\nOn the opposite end of that spectrum, the least likely to support arming teachers are Democratic women \u2014 86 percent of them are against it. Overall, 82 percent of Democrats don't think it's a good idea, and 60 percent of independents are also against it.\n\nNPR/Ipsos\n\nWhat's more, Americans say arming teachers is the least likely way to prevent school shootings \u2014 behind stricter gun laws, metal detectors, hiring more school counselors or having armed guards.\n\nSo there is a huge partisan divide on this issue, and once again, on yet another policy issue, it's the president talking to his base and not much beyond that.\n\nAt a meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday, Trump indicated an openness to ideas favored by Democrats, too, though. He has expressed support for raising the gun-purchasing age to 21 and seemed open to measures favored by liberal Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who are pushing for reinstating the 1990s-era assault weapons ban and tackling domestic violence, respectively.\n\nBut he met with the NRA Thursday night at the White House, saying it was a \"Good (Great) meeting.\"\n\nChris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, retweeted Trump and said Trump and Vice President Pence \"don't want gun control.\"\n\nIf Trump is indeed backing away from more gun control measures, it's similar to what he did on immigration and DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He had called for a bipartisan solution for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but came to the country as children. Ultimately, though, he told lawmakers any such legislation would also need to include funding for his border wall and curbs on legal immigration. None of the proposed bills mustered enough votes to pass the Senate.\n\nSo, on yet another culturally sensitive issue for his base, Trump appears to be backing away from a more bipartisan approach. (Trump has largely maintained his 37 to 42 percent average approval rating through most of his presidency, because his Republican base has stayed with him.)\n\nThat might not be surprising, considering it may be what is keeping his approval rating from dipping any lower than it already has.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents.

In film, television, comic books and memoir, there has been an ascendant generation of Muslim artists claiming their space in the representation conversation. For the second and third-generation of hyphenated artists making this work, it's an unapologetic reclamation of their narrative from terrorist headlines. One of the more rich and surprising developments in this wave is the emergence of Muslim-American theater.\n\nThe medium rewards combustible characters that clash and chafe against others on stage, igniting the dramatic sparks that win accolades. It's a fitting form for the precarious Muslim-American condition since 9/11, giving a new generation of playwrights the landscape of terrorism, profiling and suspicion to craft their high-octane drama.\n\n\"I think theater at its best gives ideas flesh and blood,\" Ayad Akhtar told me in a conversation for NPR. He's one of the most celebrated of these new voices, winning a Pulitzer Prize in 2013 for his debut play about a self-hating Muslim-American called Disgraced. \"It can animate dialectic between points of view. It's not mediated by screens and it has an ear to the ground,\" he says.\n\nOther rising Muslim-American playwrights include Wajahat Ali, who premiered The Domestic Crusaders on the eighth anniversary of 9/11 at New York City's Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9, and Hammaad Chaudry, whose play, An Ordinary Muslim, has just opened at the New York Theatre Workshop.\n\nIf there's one thread these new works share, it's their effort to counter flattened ideas of the 'Muslim' by presenting individual lives in all their complicated iterations. By inviting audiences into the homes, private spaces and inner demons of Western Muslims, they're advancing representation on stage and adding to the canon of hyphenated American theater.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Suzi Sadler/MRPR Press Suzi Sadler/MRPR Press\n\nAn Ordinary Muslim began as Chaudry's graduate thesis, and then evolved into a sprawling production under the guidance of the acclaimed American playwright Tony Kushner. The new piece wrestles with what it means to be an assimilated, \"ordinary\" Muslim. As Chaudry tells me, \" ... the larger question of the title is that there is no such thing as an ordinary Muslim. You are seeing seven different Muslims who embody different kinds of Islam.\"\n\nChaudry's play was inspired by his childhood in Scotland and his formative educational and professional years in London and New York. The piece centers on a second-generation British Muslim man named Azeem Bhatti. To his co-workers, Azeem is an integrated 'ordinary' Muslim who occasionally joins for rounds at the pub. But in private, he's struggling with how much of his faith to embrace as Britain's Islamophobia weighs on his career and his family life.\n\nHis father's history of physical abuse against his mother resurfaces as the play opens. At the same time, Azeem's own wife has decided to wear the hijab against his wishes. In the backdrop, a young preacher at the neighborhood mosque is recruiting new congregants and confronts Azeem to be a more 'visible' and less 'insecure' Muslim. As Azeem's character unravels amid these pressures \u2013 both private and public \u2013 he lashes out at one of his white co-workers. \"I don't want to be tolerated, I want to be respected,\" he screams. It's a resonant and powerful line that encapsulates the struggle for dignity facing Western Muslims.\n\nDespite its timely message, the play was conceived long before the campaign and election of President Trump brought the question of 'Muslim identity' and 'migration' to its boiling point. Hammaad Chaudry tells me the play is less about the current climate than it is about the more insidious Islamophobia reflected across popular culture since 9/11.\n\nChaudry adds that such a large ensemble production is also his way of creating roles for fellow artists of color: \"Representation is very important to me. In theater, you're dealing with a very small pool. Having said that, we've really made a commitment to have South Asian actors, but also actors that could be right for the role. It took three years and that gives you insight about the challenges you face.\"\n\nThe market reality of the mainstream New York stage imposes its own kind of limitations. At the performance of An Ordinary Muslim that I attended, the audience was older, affluent and mostly white. Each audience member was handed a reference guide to some of the unfamiliar 'Islamic' terms. At the conclusion of the play, a mediator came to the front of the theater and invited the audience to stay for a conversation about the themes of the piece \u2013 a safe space to broadcast our reservations and observations.\n\nI stayed behind with some of the older couples and one man immediately raised his voice. \"When Azeem has everything, why is he so unhappy and so ungrateful?\" he complained. The revelation that a seemingly assimilated British Muslim could harbor such confusion had left several of the viewers equally confused. The mediator nodded and added that while she couldn't answer for the playwright or the cast, we should all consider the critique.\n\nAs I left the well-intentioned Q&A, I thought about the inherently didactic responsibly thrust upon the play in this political climate. Across the curatorial and critical coverage of works like Chaudry's, there is an earnest frame placed around art by and about Muslims.\n\nIt seems to suggest that \"these works are good for you\" in the way that hearty greens can be in an age of fast food. For artists like Chaudry, that framing poses its own restrictions by foregrounding their political value over their creative achievements or limitations.\n\nAn Ordinary Muslim is an elegant and intelligent contribution to an emerging body of art about the fraught Western Muslim condition.\n\nUnfortunately, the same political forces and market opportunities that have propelled the piece to the stage may have muddled its message. The play is far too long and its characters' varying conflicts do not reach their own conclusions.\n\nAs The New York Times' theatre critic Jesse Green said, a tighter focus and a less ambitious effort to include all manner of private and public pressures could serve to sharpen the writer's thesis.\n\nThe play argues that while Muslims are misunderstood, they also deserve the space to better understand and become themselves. Like his accompanying generation of artists, Chaudry's career is only in its first act. Hopefully there are more sparks \u2013 and fewer mediators \u2013 yet to come.", "keywords": ["york", "sadlermrpr", "muslims", "ordinary", "artists", "identity", "suzi", "stage", "angst", "private", "piece", "muslim", "staging", "american", "play", "theater"], "polarity": 0.115905303030303, "subjectivity": 0.44831331168831173},

NPR and other news organizations are reporting that National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster will leave his job once the White House has determined his replacement. Retired Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl is a longtime friend of General McMaster. They worked together on U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan. And John Nagl joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us, John.\n\nJOHN NAGL: It's good to be back, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: So General McMaster is an active duty Army lieutenant general. If he does leave his job as national security adviser, do you know what he would do next?\n\nNAGL: I don't know for sure, but there is a lot of speculation. So Vince Brooks is the current commander of U.S. forces in Korea. He's been there two years. And just a couple of days ago, very unexpectedly, he announced that he is going to be leaving his post this summer in July or August. It's a little bit early. Usually, it's a three-year tour, and there were no indications before this week that Vince was going to be leaving that command - a very respected general loved by the Koreans. And so there's a lot of speculation in the national security community that that's where H.R. is going to go next...\n\nMARTIN: Because...\n\nNAGL: Vince is being moved out to provide a fourth star for H.R.\n\nMARTIN: And that's the key, right? He doesn't - he can't take a lateral move. That would not look so great. So there has to be a four-star billet somewhere for him, a four-star job, and Korea would be a high post, would put him in the mix when thinking about the strategy as pertains to North Korea.\n\nNAGL: Oh, it would make him by far the most important American on the Korean Peninsula. Not only is there no U.S. ambassador to South Korea, the Trump administration hasn't even nominated somebody. The man they had nominated, Victor Cha, withdrew after he said that a preventive war with North Korea was a bad, bad, bad idea. And he was punished, obviously, for telling the truth about that. So H.R. would be it for the United States if he assumes this position. And, interestingly, he's been a pretty strong voice for what's called preventive war with North Korea, something that gives a lot of people in the community shivers.\n\nMARTIN: I know that there have been names floated as a possible replacement to General McMaster, including John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Do you have any insight into this, into who could take this job?\n\nNAGL: So the names I've heard are Keith Kellogg, who's currently the chief of staff at the National Security Council, Steve Biegun, an executive at Ford Motor Company, who I knew well, former national security official. I worked with him at the Center for a New American Security. Keith would be a - is really a staffer I think, not a principle. I don't think he's going to get the job. He'll stay in his current role. Steve Beigun would, in my eyes, be a great choice. He's a moderate, a pragmatist. But the person I think is going to get the job is John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. And his - the idea of his appointment pretty much terrifies most of the people in the center of the national security community. He's an advocate for preventive war with North Korea and with Iran, very, very strong interventionist hawk. But he does defend the president on Fox News. And he's been meeting with the president, and I believe he's going to be our next national security adviser.\n\nMARTIN: Let me ask you, John. You and I talked early last year after H.R. McMaster found himself having to walk back something that President Trump had said, which has now happened several times. And you told me then that General McMaster was in an impossible position, that the president expects him to defend the indefensible. Do you think this job has taken a toll on him?\n\nNAGL: There's no doubt it has. And no one who works for this president comes out looking better afterwards, with the possible exception of Jim Mattis, who is able to use the military as a little bit of a shield and does have the Potomac between him and the president. But I do think H.R. has been diminished in some ways. His integrity has taken a bit of a hit. But I personally, and most of the people who know him and admire him, think that he's done the minimum necessary in terms of character defacement infringement in order to continue in his position and really work to moderate the president's worst impulses.\n\nMARTIN: Lastly, in just a couple seconds, he also said in that interview no one else in the administration had the same credibility that H.R. has. Are you concerned about what this White House is going to look like without him there?\n\nNAGL: I absolutely am. A friend of mine - all of us are talking about what this all means, and one of my friends said this is the best thing that could have happened to H.R., getting this fourth star. But it's the worst thing that could have happened for the nation. And the nation is worse off without H.R. serving as a moderator on this president in the White House.\n\nMARTIN: Retired Lieutenant Colonel John Nagl. Thanks so much, John.\n\nNAGL: Thank you, Rachel.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

But when you've been president everything in the past is ripe for perusal by historians, researchers and journalists.\n\nAnd so it is with the love letters of former President Barack Obama \u2014 excerpts of which have been released by Emory University's Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives and Rare Book Library, where the letters a young Obama wrote to then-girlfriend Alexandra McNear are now part of the collection.\n\nThe letters were written between September 1982 and April 1984, after Obama had transferred from Occidental College in Los Angeles to Columbia University in New York City. McNear remained in California.\n\nThe first letter in the collection, which the university says Obama wrote at a campus cafe, \"drinking V8 juice and listening to a badly scratched opera being broadcast,\" as he put it, finds Obama articulating what would become familiar themes in his later writing, feelings of not belonging and alienation (themes that many 21-year-olds might find familiar).\n\nIn September 1982, he writes of a college friend who will soon marry and a high school friend who manages a supermarket.\n\n\"I must admit large dollops of envy for both groups, my American friends consuming their life in the comfortable mainstream, the foreign friends in the international business world,\" Obama wrote McNear. \"Caught without a class, a structure, or a tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me.\n\n\"The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions, classes, make them mine, me theirs. Taken separately, they're unacceptable and untenable.\"\n\nHe ends the letter, which was written on yellow-lined note paper, \"I trust you know that I miss you, that my concern for you is as wide as the air, my confidence in you as deep as the sea, my love rich and plentiful, Love, Barack.\"\n\nIn a November 1982 letter, Obama writes of the enjoyment he takes in his relationship with McNear, and the challenge of \"forging a unity, mixing it up, constructing the truth to be found between the seams of individual lives. All of which requires breaking some sweat. Like a good basketball game. Or a fine dance. Or making love.\n\n\"We will talk long and deep, Alex, and see what we can make of this.\"\n\nIn June 1983, Obama writes McNear during a trip he took back to Indonesia, where he lived as a child and where his mother and sister remain.\n\n\"I can't speak the language well anymore. I'm treated with a mixture of puzzlement, deference and scorn because I'm American, my money and my plane ticket back to the U.S. overriding my blackness. I see old dim roads, rickety homes winding back towards the fields, old routes of mine, routes I no longer have access to.\"\n\nHe also expresses to McNear some uncertainty about the future of their relationship. \"I think of you often, though I stay confused about my feelings,\" Obama writes. \"It seems we will ever want what we cannot have; that's what binds us; that's what keeps us apart.\"\n\nLater that year, Obama and McNear are no longer lovers, but remain friends. He writes her of his struggles finding a job in New York, and of his tight finances. \"Salaries in the community organizations are too low to survive on right now, so I hope to work in some more conventional capacity for a year, allowing me to store up enough nuts to pursue those interests next,\" he says.\n\n\"One week I can't pay postage to mail a resume and writing sample,\" he writes, \"the next I have to bounce a check to rent a typewriter.\"\n\nBy 1984, Obama has found a job at Business International where he says, \"[c]uriously enough, I've emerged as one of the 'promising young men' of Business International, with everyone slapping my back and praising my work.\"\n\nHe writes he has \"cultivated strong bonds with the black women and their children in the company, who work as librarians, receptionists, etc.,\" while \"the only black men are teen messengers.\"\n\nHe concludes:\n\n\"The resistance I wage does wear me down \u2014 because of the position, the best I can hope for is a draw, since I have no vehicle or forum to try to change things. For this reason, I can't stay very much longer than a year. Thankfully, I don't yet feel like the job has dulled my senses or done irreparable damage to my values, although it has stalled their growth.\"\n\nEmory says facsimiles of Obama's letters will be on view Friday. The letters themselves will be available to scholars and students by appointment.", "keywords": ["university", "love", "letters", "obama", "emory", "letter", "wrote", "young", "mcnear", "longer", "writes", "barack", "library", "view"], "polarity": 0.1192001362834696, "subjectivity": 0.3787748516915183},

He also spoke more generally about his record during his first year in office. \"I will tell you this in a non-braggadocious way,\" Trump said. \"There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at some of the president's claims.\n\nCLAIM: The GOP tax plan is primarily aimed at workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder.\n\n\"Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America,\" Trump said. \"The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe fitters. The people that like me best.\"\n\nSome elements of the GOP plan would benefit such workers, including a larger standard deduction and an expanded child tax credit. But blue-collar workers are hardly the bill's main focus. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, less than 20 percent of the total tax savings in 2019 would go to workers making $87,400 or less (the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution). These workers fare even worse after 2025, when the individual tax cuts in the Senate bill are set to expire. By 2027, people making less than $54,700 would see a tax increase under the Senate bill, while those making between $54,700 and $93,200 would see a modest cut, accounting for less than 3 percent of the bill's total tax savings.\n\nCLAIM: The GOP tax plan is hard on rich people, like President Trump.\n\n\"This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing, believe me. This is not good for me,\" Trump said. \"I have some very wealthy friends, not so happy with me. But that's OK.\"\n\nUpper-income taxpayers would be the biggest beneficiaries of the GOP plans to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and to lower taxes on so-called pass-through companies, which are taxed at the individual rate. They would also benefit from elimination of the alternative minimum tax and their heirs would benefit from a higher threshold on the inheritance tax. According to the Tax Policy Center, 63 percent of the total savings from the Senate bill in 2019 would go to taxpayers earning more than $150,100 (the top 20 percent of earners), while nearly a quarter would go to the top 5 percent \u2014 people making upwards of $303,200.\n\nTop earners do even better after 2025, when the individual tax cuts expire but other provisions continue. By 2027, 90 percent of the total tax savings go to people making more than $154,900 (the top 20 percent of earners) and nearly 62 percent go to the top 1 percent \u2014 people making more than $912,100.\n\nCLAIM: Job growth has surged under President Trump.\n\n\"We've created nearly 2 million jobs,\" Trump said. \"Think of it. We used to lose millions. Now we've created 2 million jobs since I won the election.\"\n\nThe U.S. job market continues to improve, with unemployment in October falling to its lowest level in 17 years. (November job numbers will be out next week.) Since February \u2014 Trump's first full month in office \u2014 U.S. employers have added an average of 169,000 jobs each month. This is slightly below the pace of 199,000 jobs per month during the comparable period in 2016.\n\nCLAIM: Economic growth has surged under President Trump.\n\n\"The Commerce Department announced this morning that our GDP, that's the big one, in the third quarter, grew even faster than they reported previously,\" Trump said. \"Now it comes in at 3.3 percent, which is the largest increase in many years. And if we didn't have the hurricanes, we would have been at 4 percent.\"\n\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is the broadest estimate of the U.S. economy, and the Commerce Department did say Wednesday that GDP grew at 3.3 percent between July and September \u2014 an upward revision from the department's earlier estimate. The last time GDP grew that rapidly was in 2014. Forecasters anticipate somewhat slower growth in the last three months of the year. Macroeconomic Advisers, for example, is predicting fourth-quarter growth of 2.5 percent.\n\nAnalysts originally expected that a spate of hurricanes would temporarily depress growth in the third quarter, but that didn't happen. In fact, by closing ports, the storms may have slowed imports and temporarily boosted GDP.\n\nCLAIM: Speaking of hurricanes ...\n\nPresident Trump acknowledged that Puerto Rico has not bounced back as quickly from storm damage as Texas and Florida.\n\n\"Puerto Rico has been a very tough situation because of the fact that it was in very, very bad shape before the storms ever hit,\" the president said. \"But they're doing well there and it's healing and it's getting better. And we're getting them power and all of the things they have to have.\"\n\nConditions in Puerto Rico have slowly improved since Hurricane Maria struck more than two months ago.

Rob Ramirez, a firefighter with the city of Margate, Fla., was dispatched to the casualty collection point during the Parkland shooting.\n\nThere, people who were injured inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were brought out to be assessed and treated before going to the hospital.\n\nI know I'm not the same person I was the morning I went to work as who I am today, two weeks after the call. This changes you as a person.\n\nRamirez says first responders were overwhelmed with victims who had what he called \"battlefield\" injuries.\n\n\"All of them with major traumatic injuries,\" he said. \"As you can imagine, these small-frame, small-bodied, high school children taking these large caliber weapons \u2014 multiple rounds, to the torso, legs, arms, extremity.\"\n\nThey transported 14 people to the hospital. Two victims died at the triage scene.\n\nRamirez says that while he's \"doing well\" since the shooting, he thinks about it often and he worries about post-traumatic stress disorder developing in the Parkland first responders.\n\n\"The men and women that responded to that call are not the same men and women that walked away from it,\" Ramirez said. \"I know I'm not the same person I was the morning I went to work as who I am today, two weeks after the call. This changes you as a person.\"\n\nPTSD is characterized by reliving an event through flashbacks and nightmares. It often isn't diagnosed immediately after a tragedy.\n\nBeing hyper vigilant and startling easily are normal reactions to experiencing or witnessing trauma like the Parkland scene. It becomes a disorder if the symptoms don't subside in a month or two, or start causing trouble at home or at work.\n\nRight now, Florida law allows first responders to get medical coverage under workers' compensation if they get PTSD on the job. But if they need time off for treatment, or if the PTSD becomes disabling, they must also have a physical injury to have their salaries covered.\n\nA bill to address that failed last year, and was on an uncertain path before Parkland.\n\nCarlos Guillermo Smith, who represents Orlando in Florida's state legislature, supports it.\n\n\"Many of the first responders from the mass shooting in Parkland are going to need this bill,\" he said during a recent committee debate. \"Some of them probably don't even know it yet.\"\n\nUntil now, the bill's main sticking point had been financial. The Florida League of Cities estimated it would cost between $15 million and $95 million to include PTSD as a qualifying condition for workers' comp, assuming first responders take between six months and a year off to recover. The organization cited the price tag as it lobbied against the bill.\n\nThat drew an angry rebuke from Jimmy Patronis, Florida's chief financial officer who is also the state's fire marshal. In a statement, Patronis called the League's opposition to the bill \"disgraceful\" and called its report \"wrought with flawed and erroneous data, to support why they don't care about the first responders who make up the communities they represent.\"\n\nAfterwards, David Cruz, a lobbyist with the Florida League of Cities, backed off. His organization now supports the bill.\n\nOne of the most outspoken advocates for change has been Jessica Realin. Her husband Gerry Realin was diagnosed with PTSD after spending at least four hours inside Pulse nightclub, preparing and transporting the 49 dead.\n\nHe was in the heat of summer, wearing a hazmat suit with no helmet, and his boots turned yellow, then red, from the blood and gore.\n\nWhen Jessica Realin heard there were still bodies inside the school the day after the Parkland shooting, she cried. \"It reminded me of my husband, and just him reiterating how they needed to get them out,\" she said.\n\nAbout a year passed before Gerry Realin was granted a disability pension from the Orlando Police Department, outside the Florida workers' compensation system. He sued the department within the state's workers' comp system for about $26,000.\n\nJudge of Compensation Claims Neal Pitts ruled against Realin in January.\n\n\"If he had sustained even a minor accompanying physical injury, he would be entitled to both medical and indemnity benefits,\" Pitts wrote. \"To change this outcome would require action by the Legislature, should they deem it necessary.\"\n\nFinal votes on that action are set for Monday.\n\nRep. Matt Willhite, one of the legislation's sponsors, is encouraging his fellow lawmakers to pass it so that the death toll attributable to the Parkland attack won't grow to include \"first responders who take their life because of this.\"\n\nWMFE and ProPublica are investigating PTSD and suicides in first responders as part of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

Hart is a water resource economist at the World Bank in an intellectually elite environment where her colleagues might be surprised to hear her describe herself this way.\n\nRaised outside of Houston, Texas, she spent summers visiting family in the South. Often, these family members were just getting by, like her great-uncle Reece Billings, who lived near Independence, Va.\n\n\"He died within the last 10 years, never having had indoor plumbing, never having had electrical wiring in his house, never having had a telephone line to his house,\" she says. \"The water for the kitchen came from the stream through a PVC pipe, then dumped into a sink and then there was an egress PVC pipe that took it back to the stream downhill.

Going to the local Walmart ... and realizing that, \"Boy, the things they're selling in the produce aisle are different,\" or \"There's a whole aisle where everything is in two languages, and I never noticed that before.\" ... \"Suddenly it feels like this community that I knew so well\" \u2014 so what they were saying is that they don't feel like it's \"theirs\" anymore. ...\n\nAnd that coupled with economic changes, with jobs disappearing. And that coupled with \u2014 you know, the cultural things in a town that has had a very strong immigrant population for decades. There were people from Italy, and people from Ireland, and people from Germany and Montenegro and Slovakia and Slovenia, and they all had their traditions. And suddenly they have to make space for newcomers who come in.\n\nAnd that has happened throughout decades in America, but when the newcomers are brown, and when the newcomers speak a different language, and when the newcomers are less interested in assimilating in the same way and suddenly speaking English \u2014 they want to hold on to their old culture or they want to hold on to their old language ... suddenly the word \"immigrant\" when it's spoken now doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nOn race as subtext\n\nThey wouldn't necessarily say \"those brown people,\" or \"those Latino people.\" There would often be sort of proxy for that \u2014 \"the food is different, the music is different, the town feels different.\" There was a large \"threat\" narrative \u2014 safety is a big issue here. People felt like, with the changing community, the crime rate had increased, or that they just didn't feel as safe as they used to.\n\nIn some cases it was for a good reason \u2014 someone had literally driven a car into their restaurant, or someone had had a wallet taken. In a lot of cases, though, the fear was based on something in the abstract, not something that had actually happened to them \u2014 but the fear that if they did go downtown that bad things would happen, or if they did go to the mall that it no longer was as safe as it used to be.\n\nOn the generational shift\n\nThere was a difference in the way that people who were more advanced in years talked about it, than the kids. Because the kids are in probably the most diverse environment \u2014 they all go to the same schools, they play on the same sports teams, they cheer together on the cheerleading squad, to some degree they socialize with each other. ... They had a sort of more direct approach to talk about some of these things than people who still lived in communities where they lived and worshipped among people who looked like them or had a similar background. ...\n\nI remain optimistic, and yet I'm pragmatic. And so I know that when we say that race is perhaps an easier concept for young people ... it's easier, but it's not easy. It's not yet easy. And a mistake that's often made is thinking that because they ... inherited this incredible degree of integration that was completely foreign to just one or two generations ahead of them, that all the problems have been solved. That's not true. ...\n\nI think future is still something that we should be optimistic about, but it might take two, three, four generations before some of this gets easier. And it's not just because of demographics and race, it's also because of the economic tumult that we're facing, and it's also because of technological tumult \u2014 I mean, people's jobs are being replaced in large part by technology, and that creates a certain degree of vertigo. So it's not one thing.

The new court-drawn map is expected to upend that tilt.\n\nJustices described their map in their 48-page decision as \"superior\" to other proposals filed for their consideration.\n\nTop statehouse Republicans have pledged to challenge the judicially enacted map, which they say amounts to overreach by the Democratic-majority court.\n\nThe court's decision comes after a monthlong standoff. When justices first declared the previous map unconstitutional on Jan. 22, they ordered the GOP-controlled Legislature and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to negotiate a compromise.\n\nThe justices said they wanted the new map to be fairer, specifying that districts should be more compact and contiguous and should split fewer municipalities.\n\nA compromise map never happened.\n\nAnalysis Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System? Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System? Listen \u00b7 4:42 4:42\n\nUltimately, House and Senate Republicans, House Democrats, Senate Democrats, Wolf and Lt. Gov. Mike Stack submitted maps completely independently.\n\nThat's in addition to one sent in by a group of Republican activists who intervened in the case and two sent in by the case's Democratic petitioners along with the League of Women Voters. All parties to the case were technically allowed to file maps.\n\nThe submitted maps varied significantly in terms of partisan advantage, though overall they all made districts more compact, and to varying degrees they divided fewer municipalities.\n\nThe various parties to the case approached the redistricting process differently. House and Senate Republicans worked largely with existing staff members who have previous Pennsylvania mapping experience. They said they didn't take partisanship into consideration at all, and they ended up with a map with a relatively similar GOP advantage to the current one.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolf, the governor, hired Tufts University professor Moon Duchin to consult on his map. Her analysis, the governor said, found that the map has \"no partisan skew in comparison to over a billion randomly generated maps.\"\n\nThe justices were advised by Nathan Persily, a Stanford law professor with a background in drawing political district maps. He has previously assisted judges in New York, Connecticut, North Carolina, Georgia and Maryland in redistricting cases.\n\n\"We're going to have a Stanford professor come into Pennsylvania, and he's going to act as the prosecutor by presenting the evidence, he's going to act as the juror by evaluating the evidence, and he solely is going to act as a judge by ultimately ruling on the evidence and producing a map \u2014 one person \u2014 to the court for the people of Pennsylvania to live under,\" state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said in advance of Monday's announcement.\n\nRepublicans also are calling the process foul. The court didn't file its full opinion until two days before the Legislature's deadline to submit a compromise map to Wolf.\n\nGOP leaders have said the lack of guidance is the reason they didn't start drawing a map in earnest until 48 hours before it was due \u2014 a decision that left them no time to get a vote from the Legislature. The map that they ultimately submitted was from the Legislature's two GOP leaders.\n\nStatehouse Republicans say the court is usurping the power of the legislative and executive branches, a situation that essentially creates a \"constitutional crisis.\"", "keywords": ["democrats", "senate", "voting", "shift", "republicans", "submitted", "professor", "court", "wolf", "map", "going", "pennsylvania", "courtdrawn", "advantage"], "polarity": 0.07664502164502165, "subjectivity": 0.40857413419913413},

Ted Yoho On Change At The State Department\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nFor days now, Washington has been awash with rumors that President Trump is about to fire more senior members of his administration. Trump himself has teased the changes to come more than once, including this comment yesterday.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There'll always be change, and I think you want to see change, and I want to also see different ideas.\n\nGREENE: Trump, of course, has already gotten started. Earlier this week, he abruptly announced that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was done. The president wants to replace Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. I want to bring in someone who has to work with the president a lot on foreign policy. It's Congressman Ted Yoho. He's a Republican from Florida and the vice chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, welcome to the program.\n\nTED YOHO: Hey, thanks for having me on, David.\n\nGREENE: So the president said he is close to having the Cabinet and other things I want. He said that this week. What does the president want here with these changes?\n\nYOHO: Well, I think, you know, in any administration, you're going to go through some changes to find personalities and people that align more with your policies. And I thought Rex Tillerson did an outstanding job, but yet, he and the president differed on some things. And so I think he's sorting through to find that person that is more in alignment with what he wants to do with North Korea and, you know, around the world.\n\nGREENE: Well, say more about that. I mean, what do you think was missing in terms of Tillerson's policy when it comes to things like North Korea and Iran, and what are you hoping to see differently?\n\nYOHO: Well, I think if you look at the way Rex Tillerson came out and was talking about negotiations with Iran is the best way to go and not bloody noses, the president came out and said you're wasting your time talking about negotiations because it'll never happen, I think that shows a very distinct divide in their perspective or the direction that they wanted to go. And I think you'll see Mike Pompeo more in alignment in that negotiations were at a point where they could start. There's a possibility for them starting. And one of the things that we all want to see is no capitulation on the United States like the last three administrations did.\n\nGREENE: You want a tougher policy on Iran you're saying.\n\nYOHO: On North Korea - I'm sorry. I misspoke if I said Iran - on North Korea. We need - if the negotiations are moving forward, we need to make sure that we don't make the mistakes of the last three administrations that led us to this point where North Korea has, you know, the ICBMs near perfection and then they detonated the four nuclear bombs under Kim Jong Un. The last three administrations, by not standing tough on the sanctions, have led us to this point. So we want to make sure we don't do that.\n\nAnd as far as Iran, I think the president has been very clear where they stood on that. And I think it's something that Iran needs to know that we are going to stay on top of the JCPOA commitments. And if they break that, then we need to put the sanctions back on.\n\nGREENE: You're talking about the Iran nuclear deal. Let me just ask you about North Korea. I mean, how do we make sense of this being tougher and not making the same mistakes as previous administrations in your words but now talk of the president actually sitting down with the leader of North Korea, which seems like it could be seen as capitulating and doing more negotiating than being tough? I mean, what should we be taking from this?\n\nYOHO: Well, some people think that if he sits down that he's capitulated and already recognize them as a nuclear state, but, you know, go back to the last three administrations, you know, Bill Clinton walked away from the deal because they were cheating on what they already promised not to do. You know, and under Bush, they gave away some sanctions. And President Obama had the strategy of strategic patience. And in this one, I'm OK with President Trump sitting down because I don't think it legitimizes Kim Jong Un, but I also think it says that we're serious. We're at the top of the negotiator - negotiations with our person that's sitting down with him versus having an emissary. And let's see where it goes from here.\n\nAnd I think what we all could hope and pray for is that this is the beginning of bringing the escalation that's been happening on the North Korea - or on the Korean Peninsula over the last 30 years to a reasonable end to where that part of the region or the world in fact is safer from now on. We've seen too many wars in our lifetime, and we're still paying the legacy for the Vietnam War and World War II.\n\nGREENE: Well, on that topic, I mean, Rand Paul, the Republican senator on the committee in the Senate that will be confirming Mike Pompeo, suggested that he doesn't want to see more wars either and that someone like Mike Pompeo might be more likely to go to war as secretary of state. Are you at all worried that he's too hawkish?\n\nYOHO: You know what? History will tell who's right on this. We could also say that the negotiators over the last 25 years have led us to a point where, you know, the escalation on the North Korean side had gotten to a point where war was pretty eminent. And so maybe it's time for a different stance on that and let them know we're not going to capitulate and buy Kim Jong Un more time while we pretend there is going to be negotiations to where he perfects his ICBM.\n\nGREENE: All right, much more to talk about obviously. Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nYOHO: Hey, thanks a lot. Have a great day.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

She noted that many, while supportive, expressed concerns about retaliations by their bosses if they spoke out. She noted that of the women who originally signed the letter, only five are staffers at the state Capitol.\n\n\"It's a power dynamic that's difficult even for female lawmakers,\" Corbin said. \"Even for women in the Legislature, men often control fundraising, your ability to get bills passed \u2014 even women at the highest levels feel that they're not insulated\" from retaliation.\n\nShe stressed that many men at the state Capitol have reached out to ask what they can do to help. But Corbin noted, some men are oblivious to sexual harassment, even when it happens right in front of them.\n\n\"They don't know what it looks like or how to intervene,\" Corbin said. \"Some of them don't even see what's happening with their own colleagues.\"\n\nThe women leaders write that \"millions of Americans were shocked\" to learn of Weinstein's behavior.\n\n\"We were not. This same kind of inappropriate, sexually harassing behavior cuts across every industry and facet of our society. No matter a woman's age, weight, religion, sexual orientation, race, social status, or position of power, she is not insulated from this behavior. It is pervasive,\" they wrote.\n\nThe letter goes on to detail the ways in which all of the letters' signatories have endured or witnessed \"some form of dehumanizing behavior by men with power in our workplaces.\"\n\nTheir list is long and explicit: Groping. Touching. Inappropriate comments about bodies and abilities. Insults and sexual innuendo, frequently disguised as jokes. Promises and threats.\n\n\"They have leveraged their power and positions to treat us however they would like,\" the group wrote, noting that they didn't speak up before out of fear, out of shame.\n\n\"Often these men hold our professional fates in their hands. They are bosses, gatekeepers, and contacts. Our relationships with them are crucial to our personal success,\" they wrote. \"We don't want to jeopardize our future, make waves, or be labeled 'crazy,' 'troublemaker,' or 'asking for it.' Worse, we're afraid when we speak up that no one will believe us, or we will be blacklisted.\"\n\nThe signatories include Democrats and Republicans; dozens of lawmakers and other elected officials; lobbyists, political consultants; party leaders. In short, pretty much every sector of California's political world.\n\nThey are asking other women to come forward, and have launched a website to collect stories and support one another. And they are demanding that men support them.\n\n\"We're done with this,\" the letter states. \"Each of us who signed this op-ed will no longer tolerate the perpetrators or enablers who do. What now? It's time for women to speak up and share their stories. We also need the good men, and there are many, to believe us, have our backs, and speak up. Until more women hold positions of power, our future is literally dependent on men. It's time.\"\n\nCorbin noted that while some legislators are notorious for their behavior toward women, organizers decided against naming names.\n\n\"Even if we had a list of the five worst offenders, it wouldn't do anything,\" she said. \"There's more than five.

The hotel developers \u2014 including a little-known company called Bayrock Group \u2014 suddenly owned an American historic site.\n\nChurch archivist David Pultz says Bayrock officials stalled DNA testing for years. \"My suspicion was they were trying to avoid controversy\" that might bring more scrutiny, he said.\n\nEmbedded Trump Stories: Trump SoHo Trump Stories: Trump SoHo Listen \u00b7 43:18 43:18\n\nA hotel behind veils\n\nIn fact, at Trump SoHo, a lot remains unknown, including the project's true source of funding.\n\nBut now the man whose name brands the hotel \u2014 Donald Trump \u2014 lives in the White House. And his financial ties reportedly are being investigated by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller in connection with a larger probe into possible ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russian officials.\n\nNote this: In a lawsuit, Bayrock's former finance director Jody Kriss portrays the firm as a money-laundering operation, used to conceal transfers of illicit funds and disguise them as legitimate real estate transactions. He also alleges that cash infusions from overseas were fraudulently portrayed as loans to help the firm's principals evade taxes.\n\n\"Tax evasion and money laundering are the core of Bayrock's business model,\" the lawsuit alleges. And the Trump SoHo building, it said, was \"a monument to spectacularly corrupt money-laundering and tax evasion.\"\n\nBayrock has denied money-laundering allegations; the company's spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. The White House referred all questions about Trump SoHo to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n\nMueller's team reportedly is specifically looking into money laundering in New York City real estate. That investigation \u2014 along with the discovery process of various lawsuits \u2014 may help uncover information about the business back story of the man whom Americans have elected president.\n\nAnd the NPR podcast Embedded also has been digging around, trying to understand more about one Trump signature project. Here's what the reporters learned.\n\nHow it all started\n\nWith much fanfare, Trump announced the project on his TV show, The Apprentice, in 2006.\n\nThroughout the years, the project kept making news, what with the bones, a heated standoff with the neighborhood and the grisly death of a construction worker. And lawsuits started to hit, alleging fraud and shady financing.\n\nDonald Trump announces Trump SoHo on the Apprentice in 2006. YouTube\n\nThe early zoning battles set the tone: Residential properties weren't allowed in the neighborhood where the property was proposed. Local activists confidently predicted zoning problems would kill the 46-story project. But city officials allowed the building to go up as a condo-hotel hybrid.\n\nUnits were sold like condos, but owners could stay only a few weeks at a time, totaling about four months annually. For Trump, it was a licensing deal: The developer would get use of Trump's name, and Trump would get fees for managing the building. And in a legal deposition, Trump said he also got an 18 percent equity share of the building.\n\nIn a New York magazine article, Trump says the idea for the Trump SoHo was presented to him as \"a complete proposal\" by one of the two developers, Bayrock and the Sapir Organization. The former had been launched several years earlier by two Soviet-born immigrants, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater. The latter was part of a New York real-estate empire started by Soviet-born financier Tamir Sapir and his son Alex.\n\n\"Only ... cash deals\"\n\nAs it turned out, selling the New York condo-hotel to U.S.-based buyers was tough; the \"non-residential\" designation meant they couldn't qualify for mortgages, says Ruedi Sieber, a broker who at the time worked for a firm selling the Trump SoHo units.\n\n\"You could only do cash deals,\" Sieber said. \"So unless the guy had a million and a half in cash to purchase the property, he couldn't buy it because no bank would give you a loan.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump SoHo sales went a lot better with wealthy buyers in Latin America, Europe and the former Soviet Union. The pitch was simple, Sieber says: You could own a piece of real estate in Manhattan, with views of the Hudson River with five-star service. Trump's Apprentice fame helped.\n\nCondo buyers take SoHo to court\n\nBut then, the Great Recession hit New York real estate hard, and some of the Trump SoHo's condo buyers began getting cold feet. They turned to Manhattan attorney Adam Bailey to try to get back their money.\n\nAs Bailey investigated, he and his team zeroed in on the way the Trump SoHo was marketed as almost sold-out.\n\nIn media interviews, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., \"a Trump representative\" and other officials had been saying that 60 percent or \"more than half\" of the building's units were already sold.\n\nBut documents found by Bailey's team indicated the total sold was not quite 16 percent. \"I'm like, 'This is fraud. Done,' \" he said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAs Bailey pursued his civil suit, he also sent evidence of possible criminal issues to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.'s office. He says prosecutors there were \"very interested\" and \"started working on it.\"\n\nWith that investigation going on, the developers and Trump \u2014 who has long boasted that he never settles lawsuits \u2014 agreed to settle Bailey's case, refunding the buyers 90 percent of their money and paying legal fees, but without admitting any wrongdoing. Bailey and his clients signed a nondisclosure agreement barring them from discussing any evidence of criminal fraud.\n\nCriminal case goes away\n\nWithout cooperating witnesses, Vance dropped the criminal case. A recent investigative series by WNYC-FM, ProPublica and The New Yorker said some prosecutors in Vance's office wanted to proceed with the case but were blocked by Vance.\n\nThe news stories also indicated that Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz had made two five-figure donations to Vance's campaign in 2012: one that Vance received and soon returned before dropping the case; another one Vance received, and also returned, after the case was already dropped. Vance has publicly insisted he dropped the case only because the evidence was insufficient.\n\nWho funded this project?\n\nIf it had gone forward, the investigation might have provided some answers to questions \u2014 such as, why did Trump, who'd had a string of bankruptcies, suddenly get a generous offer from Bayrock?\n\nIn a legal deposition, Trump once tried to explain it: \"We had a tenant in the building, in Trump Tower, called Bayrock, and Bayrock was interested in getting us into deals and we \u2014 somebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure \u2014came to see \u2014 either myself or one of my children ... about doing this job.\"\n\nThe \"job\" required no investment from Trump, but could potentially funnel millions his way for the use of his gilded brand name. Trump agreed to it: The Trump Organization would collect fees for managing the building, and son Donald Jr. and daughter Ivanka would manage the marketing and sale of its residences.\n\nWhat was Bayrock?\n\nToday, the history of the financing and construction of Trump SoHo is reportedly one of the subjects under investigation by Mueller.\n\nThe SoHo deal may help explain possible financial ties connecting Trump to Russian associates involved with Bayrock, founded by the Soviet-born financier Arif, who acquired a chromium plant in Kazakhstan and became one of the country's wealthiest men.\n\nAt his side was Sater, born in Moscow, raised in Brooklyn and known for a checkered past. In the 1990s, he did time in prison for stabbing a man in the face with a broken glass during a bar fight, and later pleaded guilty in connection with a securities fraud scheme, which allegedly was aided by the Italian Mafia.\n\nBut Sater would also become a valuable cooperating witness for the U.S. government, helping it convict mob figures for financial-fraud crimes and even earning praise from Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nIn various legal depositions involving Bayrock, Sater was usually described as someone whose job was to raise money for the company.\n\nTo build the Trump SoHo, Bayrock would team up with Alex Sapir, the son of billionaire Tamir Sapir, who was born in the Soviet republic of Georgia and grew rich in the fertilizer and oil businesses \u2014 and later in New York real estate deals. (The senior Sapir died in 2014).\n\ntoggle caption Mark Von Holden/WireImage/Getty\n\nToday, much of what's known about Bayrock and its financing comes from various lawsuits filed against the firm. One suit was filed by the former finance director Kriss, who joined the firm around 2001. His suit claims he was owed money by his former company, which he describes as \"spectacularly corrupt,\" running on cash infusions from overseas and dodging taxes. Bayrock and Kriss are currently in settlement talks.\n\nSater did not return requests for comment, and his attorney said the Kriss lawsuit was meritless.\n\nHow much did Trump know?\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2007, the New York Times published an article that detailed Sater's criminal past, as spelled out in a then-sealed criminal complaint. Sater said he was a changed man, telling the Times, \"I am not proud of some of the things that happened in my twenties. I'm proud of the things I am doing now.\"\n\nThe article would raise legal questions for Trump. When a principal at a firm has a felony conviction, investors are supposed to be told about it.\n\nTrump told the Times he knew little about Sater. \"We never knew that,\" he said about the report of Sater's financial crimes. \"We do as much of a background check as we can on the principals. I didn't really know him well,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Trump told the BBC, \"We were not the developer there. It was a licensing deal... a very simple licensing deal ...

And like that, for 10 years.\"\n\nIn 2015, Sater sent an email to Trump attorney Michael Cohen boasting of his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and proposing a new Trump real estate deal to highlight the candidate's negotiating skills, the New York Times reported. \"Our boy can become president of the United States, and we can engineer it,\" Sater wrote.\n\nTo Bloomberg reporter Tim O'Brien, who has written extensively about Trump, Sater's apparent proximity to the president raises important issues.\n\n\"The question that hangs over all this for me is, why is Donald Trump associating with someone like this?\" he asks. \"And why is he still in Trump's orbit after he got elected?\"\n\nSomewhere deep inside the history of Trump SoHo, those answers may still be buried.\n\nNPR's Chris Benderev, Kelly McEvers, Marilyn Geewax, Investigations research librarian Barbara Van Woerkom and Business Desk intern Mollie Simon contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["york", "hiding", "glass", "bayrock", "wrapped", "donald", "trumps", "case", "shiny", "real", "estate", "sater", "soho", "hotel", "trump", "mysteries"], "polarity": 0.009672587066204096, "subjectivity": 0.4216862137074903},

That's an increase \u2014 in a short period of time \u2014 from October 2017, when NPR conducted a similar survey in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Then, 68 percent said gun laws should be stricter than they were.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe poll also found widespread bipartisan support for a range of gun-control policies, including:\n\nrequiring background checks for all gun buyers (94 percent),\n\nadding people with mental illnesses to the federal gun background check system (92 percent),\n\nraising the legal age to purchase guns from 18 to 21 (82 percent),\n\nbanning bump stocks (81 percent),\n\nbanning high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds (73 percent) and\n\nbanning assault-style weapons (72 percent).\n\nThe only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump \u2014 the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.\n\nThe poll also found that while nearly every gun policy was supported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, the one exception was arming teachers.\n\nThere was a clear-cut partisan gulf \u2014 68 percent of Republicans favored the idea of training teachers to carry guns compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Arming teachers was by far the most polarizing policy suggestion; the poll found a 50-point divide between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nLoading...\n\nTrump's in sync with his base\n\nThe president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and his recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests he's acutely aware of how his base voters feel about gun policies \u2014 and the growing desire, even among Republicans, for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation.\n\n\"We see in this study, a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures, many of which Trump mentioned explicitly in his [White House] briefing,\" said Chris Jackson, director of the public polling team at Ipsos. \"And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials, who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.\"\n\nAlthough Trump remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership, he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns.\n\nIn a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday, Trump surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions.\n\n\"They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,\" Trump told GOP lawmakers at that meeting, adding, \"Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.\"\n\nTrump suggested he was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures, according to the NPR/Ipsos poll).\n\n\"President Trump is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials,\" Jackson said. \"And I think this is something that Trump has done a lot through his political career; he often times finds himself closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.\"\n\nOf course, the president has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls, and then subsequently reversing his position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude, as he did with his initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation.\n\nAmericans want Congress to act\n\nAny hope for a quick legislative answer to the gun debate fell apart in the Senate Thursday. And although the Senate now has no plans to vote on gun legislation in the near future, the NPR/Ipsos poll finds that a majority of Americans (78 percent) say Congress needs to do more to address gun violence.\n\nBut the intensity for congressional action lies with the Democrats \u2014 93 percent of whom want more action, compared to 68 percent among Republicans.\n\nLoading...\n\nJackson said the biggest change he's noticed since the October survey is the overall importance people are giving to the gun debate. Crime/gun violence is now the No. 1 issue worrying Americans. (Last October, it was terrorism).\n\nThe shift since last fall is largely because more Democrats and independents say they're concerned about guns, but Republicans shifted some as well.\n\nAnd the poll found Americans are currently saying guns will be an important factor in their vote this November. Roughly two-thirds, or 63 percent, said so.\n\nTraditionally, gun control is one of those issues that's dominated by a small slice of the electorate \u2014 an energized group of committed gun-rights activists.\n\nBut the political winds may be shifting.\n\n\"This data indicates there's actually an increasing energy on the side of gun control,\" Jackson said. And \"given that guns have become very partisan, that may have really significant results in the midterms.\"\n\nAnd there are signs the NRA's influence among voters may be declining. The NPR survey shows a decreasing number of Americans overall (led by a shift in Democrats' attitudes) said the NRA represents their views \u2014 just 36 percent overall down from 43 percent in October.\n\nLoading...\n\nGuns are still partisan\n\nThere are still some major disagreements along party lines that reflect the overall gun debate in the country.\n\nOn the question of whether the country would be safer if more people carried guns, there was a huge divide, for example \u2014 55 percent of Republicans felt the country would be safer, compared to just 15 percent of Democrats.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnd likewise, when people were asked whether they believed the premise that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun \u2014 there was a split along partisan lines \u2014 71 percent of Republicans agreed, compared to 24 percent of Democrats.\n\nThe split over Trump's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror his overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives \u2014 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents.

To the surprise of many who have only seen his name, Allan is white. And that's taken him on a lifelong odyssey of racial encounters.\n\nThose experiences prompted him to share his six words with The Race Card Project: \"My name is Jamaal ... I'm white.\"\n\nAllan grew up in southern Oregon, in a house on 18 acres with a commune on one side and a llama ranch on the other.\n\nThe origins of his name weren't that remarkable, Allan tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris.\n\n\"My parents decided they wanted less traditional names for their children. ... My dad was a Los Angeles Lakers fan and they had had a player named Jamaal Wilkes, and that name kind of came up,\" he says.\n\nHis mother \u2014 who was pregnant with Allan's sister at the time \u2014 fell in love with the sound of the name. Their parents named his sister Madera, and they named their son Jamaal \u2014 \"just to spice things up a bit, I guess,\" he says.\n\nAs Allan wrote for a blog called The Poetry Question:\n\n\"Growing up I never thought twice about my name (of course I was next door to a commune, hanging out with Orly, Oshia, Lark Song, River Rocks, Sky Blue, and more than one Rainbow). \"In a high school soccer game I was called 'a white man with a [horrific racial expletive deleted] name.' \"In January of 2002 I flew to London. I was randomly selected for additional passenger screening. It was me, Muhammad, Abdul, Tariq, and an old white haired lady named Jenny Smith. Seriously. I'm not sure what was faster, Jenny Smith's pat down or the dropping of the TSA agent's face when I responded to the name Jamaal.\"\n\nJamaal means \"beauty\" in Arabic.\n\n\"Learning the meaning behind it and, well, the beauty that comes in the sound of the name, I like that quite a bit,\" Allan says.\n\nIt's also a name that give him an unusual perspective on questions of identity, race and cultural stereotypes.\n\nWhen he goes out in Des Moines for drinks with friends who are black, the waitress or bartender often hands his debit card to someone else \u2014 someone black.\n\n\"They're making an assumption based on the name on the card and not paying attention to who handed it to them,\" Allan says. \"They say, 'Jamaal, oh that must be the black guy sitting here.' \"\n\n'We Could Use Some Diversity Here'\n\nThese kinds of assumptions also spill over into his professional life as a teacher.\n\n\"People usually don't bring it up on a first day, but after I've developed a rapport with the students and they feel comfortable having open conversations, they'll say, 'You know, when class started I thought you were going to be black,' \" Allan says.\n\nAnd he uses that as a jumping-off point for more questions: Why you would assume that and what did that mean? And were you disappointed? What were your thoughts when you actually saw me?\n\nThe question of someone's name, particularly if it has ethnic overtones, can have real consequence. One study found that after responding to 1,300 classified ads, applicants with black-sounding names were 50 percent less likely to get a callback than white-sounding names with comparable resumes.\n\nBut the opposite was at work in Allan's case. The principal who hired him told him he was lucky to get the job because they hadn't been planning to take another student teacher. Then Allan's application showed up.\n\n\"They scanned through it ... and they saw someone named Jamaal who played basketball, listed Muhammad Ali among his heroes and inspirations, and thought, 'We could use some diversity here, so let's bring this guy on, I think he'd be good for some of our younger minority male students,'\" he says. \"And, well, then I showed up.\"\n\nIf someone argued that the only reason Jamaal Allan got the job was affirmative action \u2014 well, the joke would be on them.\n\nThe school got diversity with Allan, but not necessarily the kind they thought. Not many people can say they grew up between a commune and a llama ranch.\n\n\"They said we need more diversity, we need someone who resonates well and connects with some of the young male students here,\" Allan says. \"It may not have been because of how I look, but through actions, that was exactly what they got.\"\n\nOn Allan's first day of work, he showed up at school and introduced himself to one of the secretaries.\n\n\"And she said, 'Oh, you're Jamaal, I expected you were going to be' \u2014 and there was a very long, very pregnant pause,\" Allan recalls. \"And the word she came up with was 'taller.' \"\n\n\"I just sort of chuckled and said, 'Yeah, I get reactions like that a lot.' \"", "keywords": ["words", "white", "school", "im", "allans", "diversity", "allan", "thought", "jamaal", "card", "race", "named"], "polarity": 0.07163033758104181, "subjectivity": 0.43819304717192037},

Which, considering the magazine's history on race, is either intriguing or ironic. Maybe both.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNational Geographic magazine brought the world to readers through meticulous reports and gorgeous photographs. Now it's released an issue on race. It begins with a look in the mirror at how the magazine has portrayed different races and ethnicities over more than a century. Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team reports.\n\nKAREN GRIGSBY BATES, BYLINE: The bright yellow border signals, yes, this is National Geographic. But this special issue isn't inviting readers to visit Peru or Ethiopia in its pages. This time the coverage focuses specifically on race and the role the Geographic has played in its 130-year history in shaping Americans' views on race.\n\nSUSAN GOLDBERG: What we really want to do is to create a conversation about something that is so central to, you know, understanding the United States in the 21st century.\n\nBATES: That's editor-in-chief Susan Goldberg, National Geographic's first woman editor. Goldberg oversaw what most people are calling the race issue. In a letter she wrote for the issue, Goldberg said she felt the magazine couldn't cover race and diversity without acknowledging its own problematic past.\n\nGOLDBERG: And it felt very much to me that if we were going to write about the subject of race, that to do so credibly we needed to look back at our own history.\n\nBATES: John Edwin Mason is a historian at the University of Virginia. He's also African-American. And he was tasked with diving into the archives of the Geographic to see how it relayed the world to its readers. He found a hierarchy.\n\nJOHN EDWIN MASON: And that hierarchy was very clear in the writing and in the photography that the West and especially the English-speaking world was at the top of the hierarchy and black and brown people were somewhere underneath.\n\nBATES: And Mason is clear on why that is.\n\nMASON: You know, it was a magazine that was editorially controlled almost exclusively by white men.\n\nBATES: For more than a century, women, Jewish and black people were denied membership in the National Geographic Society. The race issue contains a scientific look at how and why skin color evolved over time, the rise in interracial and same-gender marriages, racial profiling and white anxiety as the nation gets browner. You'll hear about that in a moment. All this, says Goldberg, is an effort to move forward. But this work is still done by a largely white staff. Historian John Edwin Mason says the Geographic has made progress in the past few decades, but it has a way to go.\n\nMASON: You still won't find very many voices from the Global South writing in the pages of National Geographic. You still see too few photographers of color.\n\nGOLDBERG: We're not there yet.\n\nBATES: But Goldberg says they're working on it. Next month, the Geographic looks at Muslims in America.

Half a dozen people occupy the blue velvet booths and alternative dance music blares overhead. Leigh Salinas walks in carrying a duffel bag. She's there to spend the weekend studying \u2013 sort of.\n\n\"I was certainly impacted by the presidential election in a lot of the ways that other people were,\" says the 31-year-old who works as an accountant for a local food company.\n\nSalinas says she wants to run for local office.\n\n\"It's easier, at least at first, to make a change at a local level,\" she says. \"So, that's why I'm super excited about this program specifically.\"\n\nLeigh Salinas is one of 25 participants in the inaugural ATXelerator, run by an area nonprofit called The Center for Austin's Future. The idea is to train and educate potential candidates for local office \u2013 specifically city council or various local boards and commissions.\n\nWhat makes the ATXelerator different from other candidate schools is that it's also part tech accelerator. In a normal accelerator, participants pitch a business idea and vie for investor money. Here, they will pitch themselves as a candidate for local office and vie for campaign support.\n\n\"Competition brings out the best in people,\" says Ward Tisdale, the executive director of the center.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C.

Then they'll face the panel.\n\n\"The competition is really meant to have people up their game and test them,\" Tisdale says. He's offering the support of a political action committee to candidates who rise to the challenge.\n\nAmos Schwartzfarb is the managing director of Techstars in Austin, one of the country's first startup accelerators. While tech accelerators have cropped up in just the past decade, Schwartzfarb says the idea \u2013 a period of time spent intensively studying something and then competing to win a title \u2013 is nothing new.\n\n\"I think back to when I was a kid and as an athlete,\" he says. \"Over the summers and over Thanksgiving breaks, I would go to these immersive camps, and the idea was you'll learn more and get fitter in two or three weeks than you would over the course of a full season, because this is all you do. You live, eat, breathe, sleep it all day long.\"\n\nSchwartzfarb says he's never heard of a tech-accelerator model being applied to local politics.\n\n\"I think it's not only a cool idea, I think it's an extremely timely idea,\" he says. \"The thought of the average person having more than just a vote as their political voice is not something that most people thought about [until the 2016 election].\"\n\nRemembrances Renowned Fixture Of Austin Streets Dies Renowned Fixture Of Austin Streets Dies Listen \u00b7 2:20 2:20\n\nIn the same way that many recruit and prep candidates to further a particular agenda, the ATXelerator is looking for a specific candidate \u2013 one who generally supports environmentally friendly and walkable development through denser construction and a larger variety of housing types.\n\n\"We are growing \u2013 a hundred people move here a day \u2013 and in order to preserve what we have in Austin, which is a great quality of life, we have to change,\" Tisdale says. \"And if we don't change, we're going to become an elitist city where only the rich can live, and it will be predominantly white and not diverse.\"\n\nThe average ATXelerator participant is 35 years old. Their career paths vary \u2013 there's a writer, the owner of a pet-sitting business, a city planner and a community college student. Just getting selected to participate is itself a competition \u2013 the current group of 25 was whittled down from 48 applicants.\n\nPatsy Woods Martin has no plans to use the accelerator model at her organization. She's Executive Director of Annie's List, which trains women and contributes to their campaigns for state and local office, and she doesn't employ a competitive process by design.\n\n\"Women have a hard time deciding to run for office, and so we want to provide the opportunity to understand the process to as many people as possible,\" she says. \"It's really important for us ... to have that funnel open as wide as possible.\"\n\nBut Kerry Tate, a longtime political consultant in Austin, says pitting accelerator participants against one another makes for a better learning process.\n\n\"To compete for funding, compete for ideas, learn how to frame or brand yourself and put yourself out there ... you may be a little more stimulated to get that done if you're competing for something,\" Tate says.\n\nAnd that's exactly what the ATXelerator is setting Leigh Salinas up to do. On the last day of the weekend retreat, the group hears a presentation on the city's demographics and transportation. There's a session on how to run a campaign featuring a former mayor and city council member. Then, time to pack up.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Gabriel C. P\u00e9rez/KUT 90.5 Gabriel C.

Then she explains how she might pitch herself as a candidate for local government.\n\n\"I'm from the business community,\" she says. \"I've just been thinking about how can I take my business skill set and my accounting skill set and my acumen with numbers and business and apply it to these city problems.\"\n\nThen she's off, headed home to take a nap after ATXelerator's kickoff retreat.

But special counsel Robert Mueller's probe took another step forward. Reports emerged yesterday that Mueller has subpoenaed records from The Trump Organization. It's apparently his first official demand for information connected to the president's businesses. Michael Schmidt of The New York Times reported on this, and he joins us. Good morning, Michael.\n\nMICHAEL SCHMIDT: Thanks for having me.\n\nGREENE: Thanks for coming on. Do we know exactly what Muller is asking for here?\n\nSCHMIDT: We know that there were many search terms in this subpoena that was sent to The Trump Organization, the umbrella company in which all the different business entities that Trump owns are a part of. We know that some of their requests related to Russia. But beyond that, we don't know much more. The thing that is significant to us about this is that the president's lawyers had said in the final months of last year that the investigation would be over by then. And here we are in March learning about new subpoenas.\n\nGREENE: Doesn't look like it's over. Why a subpoena? Mueller didn't have to necessarily use a subpoena. Couldn't he have just demanded this information from The Trump Organization?\n\nSCHMIDT: He could have asked for the documents. So we know that Mueller has asked different folks for different things without a subpoena. But if you ask for a subpoena, it sort of makes it ironclad. It makes it clear that you have to hand everything over. And it leaves no doubt in Mueller's mind that he has all the documents that he needs. Remember, with special counsels, they want to turn over every rock possible because they don't want to someday close up shop and then find out that there were things that they missed.\n\nGREENE: That they missed something, yeah.\n\nSCHMIDT: So they're going to want to go out and get every document, everything and make sure they've - they know about every little possible lead that has been run down.\n\nGREENE: Is there any precedent for this, for a special counsel looking beyond a president's official duties and really digging into his businesses and other connections?\n\nSCHMIDT: I don't know whether that - I think that all of this has a nexus back to the original mandate that Mueller has, which is to look at ties between Trump's associates and Russia and anything that may arise of it. Obviously, that is sort of broad, especially the part that says anything that may arise of it. I know - we know in the case of Bill Clinton that they looked at the Whitewater deal. That was obviously something that happened before he got to the White House, so I'm not sure it's that unusual. But the president has said that his personal finances unrelated to Russia are something that are off limits. We don't have evidence that this is unrelated to Russia yet, but it is certainly headed in a direction that the president has said he's - you know, that he does not want Mueller looking at.\n\nGREENE: Oh, this is interesting because he actually said that in an interview with you guys - right? - The New York Times, saying that it would be a red line if Mueller went into his businesses beyond Russia. So if that's happening and if the president considers this a red line, what would happen next? I mean, could The Trump Organization in theory refuse to turn over some documents that Mueller wants?\n\nSCHMIDT: Well, the president sets different lines and then I think doesn't always follow through on what he says he will. Sometimes he wants to get rid of people and he doesn't. So I'm not sure what it means, a red line, to this president. Obviously, to the previous president, Barack Obama, a red line was something else as well. So I'm not sure how much weight that we can put in it. The president was explicit in saying, well - well, the president said, look, they're - if they are looking into my finance - family's finances beyond Russia, that will be a problem. All we know is that some of this relates to Russia. So we're not sure if that has entered into that territory. The president is deeply skeptical of Mueller looking at things that are not directly related to Russia questions.

Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Overall, Weinstein and his former wife and current wife have given just over $1 million, according to Federal Election Commission records processed by Political MoneyLine. About $850,000 is from Weinstein himself. He also bundled, helping to raise an unknown amount of other people's money donated to Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBy comparison, the Center for Responsive Politics says San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer gave Democrats and liberal groups $91 million just in the 2015-16 election cycle.\n\nDespite his frequent checks to candidates and party committees, which raise their money under tight contribution limits, Weinstein never ventured into the deep end of political giving, where America's wealthiest political players write seven- or eight-figure checks to largely unregulated super PACs. And his companies, Miramax and the Weinstein Company, don't appear in federal disclosure reports.\n\nHis personal giving was outweighed by two other factors. He was a leader in a famously liberal industry. And as a bundler, he delivered much more in other people's money than he gave on his own. It all led to close connections with top-tier Democrats.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama visited Weinstein's home in 2012 for a fundraiser, Weinstein told the $35,800-per-ticket crowd, \"You can make the case that he's the Paul Newman of American presidents.\"\n\nThe New York Times once described Weinstein as \"a family friend\" of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And when host Charlie Rose interviewed him on CBS This Morning in 2012, they had this exchange.\n\nRose: \"So Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, which of those three is your favorite?\"\n\nWeinstein: \"I have no favorites. It's like the Beatles.\"\n\nThis week, Barack and Michelle Obama, whose eldest daughter recently interned for the Weinstein Company, issued a statement saying they \"have been disgusted\" by the accounts of Weinstein's actions, while Hillary Clinton told CNN that his conduct \"was just intolerable in every way.\"\n\nMuch of Weinstein's cash went to either the Democratic National Committee or the party's House and Senate campaign committees. But the longest list of beneficiaries \u2014 now the longest list of politicians purging his contributions \u2014 is on the Senate side of the Capitol. Over the years, he gave to 30 Senate hopefuls \u2014 including Weinstein's sole Republican recipient, 2010 Senate candidate John Chachas in Nevada.\n\nThirteen Weinstein recipients are now sitting senators, and 12 have said they're getting rid of his money. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who got a total of $1,375 from Weinstein, said that she's contributing $10,000 to a women's shelter in Los Angeles. And Hillary Clinton has said she intends to donate Weinstein's past contributions to charity.\n\nMike Fraioli, a veteran Democratic fundraiser, said Weinstein's exit from Democratic politics won't matter. \"There may have been a time when one individual was make or break,\" Fraioli said, but it's gone. \"There's just so much money in the system now.\"", "keywords": ["democratic", "democrats", "obama", "low", "senate", "political", "weinsteins", "likely", "cash", "money", "clinton", "purge", "hillary", "weinstein", "impact", "party"], "polarity": 0.08364571035025582, "subjectivity": 0.42334464777646585},

The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.\n\n\"Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,\" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.\n\nThey found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.\n\nThere were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms \u2014 such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers \u2014 reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.\n\nPrevious work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.\n\nThere is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that \"stand your ground\" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.\n\nIn general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.\n\nTo help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.\n\n\"Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,\" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.\n\n\"It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,\" says Siegel, \"but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).\"\n\nThe RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.\n\nMany of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.\n\nThe vast majority of the specialists RAND surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shootings were secondary priorities.\n\n\"That was a surprise, actually,\" says Morral. \"I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values \u2014 or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.\"\n\nHowever, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.\n\n\"Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,\" says Morral. \"And the facts are sparse.\"", "keywords": ["database", "gun", "rand", "provides", "policy", "finds", "effects", "report", "laws", "morral", "federal", "research", "evidence", "policies", "facts", "science"], "polarity": 0.03830729166666667, "subjectivity": 0.42493055555555553},

The family lives in Pacific Grove, a predominantly white, affluent area on California's Monterey Peninsula.\n\nEvery summer, Quarles' wife and children go to Germany to visit family. Consequently, Quarles spends the summers alone. And without his family around, he says, he's treated very differently.\n\nMost of the time, \"I've noticed my white counterparts almost avoid me. They seem afraid,\" Quarles tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris. \"They don't know what to think of me because I'm in their neighborhood. I oftentimes wonder if they think I'm a thug.\"\n\n\"The same does not happen when I have the security blanket and shield of my children,\" Quarles says. \"When my children are with me, I'm just a dad. I love being a dad.\"\n\nThose experiences prompted him to share his six words with The Race Card Project: \"With kids, I'm Dad; Alone, thug.\"\n\n'Where Are You From?'\n\n\"There aren't a whole lot of African-American males in Pacific Grove,\" Quarles says. \"So I think most people do wonder, 'What is this ... black guy up to? ... Why is he here, and what is he doing? And why is he in my nice, affluent neighborhood?' \"\n\nThat \"stings and bites,\" says Quarles, an ultrasound technician. \"I have a very decent job. I would take care of most of these people if they came to my hospital. And to assume that I'm anything less than a productive member of the community, that does hurt.\"\n\n'I'm Just A Regular Old Hospital Worker'\n\nQuarles recalls an incident when his family first moved into their second home in Pacific Grove. \"We had been in the home for maybe two days,\" he says, when the police knocked on the door, looking for a missing purse.\n\nThe officer asked Quarles if he had noticed anything suspicious in the neighborhood. \"And I said, 'Like what?' And he said, 'Well, the woman across the street is missing her purse.'\n\n\"And I looked at him, and I said, 'So, you can come in and look for it if you'd like. But no, I didn't take the purse.' \"\n\nQuarles was surprised when his neighbor approached him a few days later. He walked over to tell Quarles that he was \"really sorry about the other day.\"\n\n\"And I said, 'What do you mean?' And he said, 'Well, the police went over to your house.' And I'm like, 'You sent the police to my house?' \"\n\nThe neighbor explained that he did ask the police to check them out, but his family eventually found the missing purse \u2014 in their own home. He then went on, Quarles recalls, to ask Quarles where he was from.\n\n\"And I said, 'I'm from here, Pacific Grove.' And he said, 'No, really \u2014 where did you move from before you moved here to this house?' \"\n\nWhen Quarles explained that his family had moved from their first home, nearby, \"he looked at me again and he said, 'You have two houses?' \" Quarles says the neighbor then looked at him from head to toe and asked, \"What do you do?\"\n\n\"And part of me \u2014 sometimes I mess with these people. I'll tell them, 'Well, I sell drugs and I'm a pimp. I can get you anything I want.' ... I say it deadpan serious.\"\n\nThey finally realize he's joking, Quarles says, when he starts laughing. \"And once they see the crazy hours that I work and they see me in my hospital scrubs, then they clearly know I'm not a pimp and a drug dealer,\" he says. \"I'm just a regular old hospital worker.\"\n\nLiving With A Double Standard\n\nQuarles' experiences weigh on his mind when he thinks about his children. His son, Joshua, has brown skin, while he described his daughter, Danielle, as \"very, very light. She could almost pass for white.\"\n\nQuarles knows the community and the world might treat his kids differently as they grow older, particularly with one child being lighter and the other darker-skinned. \"I think the world will have a certain idea of what they are, and what they can become, just by looking at them,\" he says.\n\nThat difference also comes into play with how his kids see themselves, Quarles says. Several years ago, he says, his daughter's teacher asked the class to write essays about what the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday meant to them.\n\nIn her essay, Quarles' daughter wrote \"that if it were not for Dr. Martin Luther King, she and her brother, Joshua, would have to go to different schools,\" Quarles says.\n\n\"She meant that she would go to one school, and that her brother, Joshua, because of his browner skin, would have to go to a school other than the school that she attended.\"\n\nQuarles and his wife wrestled with if, and how, the family should discuss the issue of skin color together.\n\nIn the end, he says, \"we decided to ... let her grow and potentially approach that conversation a little bit later. Because I think eventually, and unfortunately, someone who's a little lighter than she is with a little straighter hair, with a little blonder hair, is going to call her out and get her to understand that she does have some brown in her.\"\n\nEven so, Quarles says, \"I don't know if my wife and I are doing the right things by not talking about race that much with them.\"\n\nBut as their children get older, they're the ones who are bringing it up \u2014 like this summer, after a white police officer shot black 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nQuarles says his son \"brought it up many times, and continues to bring it up. Because he identifies with being more black than white, although he's split right down the middle. And things like that do concern him.\n\n\"As he's getting older, he's getting bigger and stronger and folks are starting to wonder about him,\" Quarles adds. \"You know, 'What is he? Why is he here?' \"\n\nQuarles responds by telling his son \"that there are simply things that he cannot do,\" he says. \"Just because of his appearance and his brown skin, there are things that he can't do that the other kids can do.\"\n\nAnd if that sounds like a double-standard, Quarles says, that's because it is. \"That's my answer: 'It is a double standard, Son. And trust me, one day, you'll understand.' \"\n\nNot that Quarles accepts double standards based on skin color. But he's had to figure out how to rise above them, he says \u2014 how to succeed by letting certain slights go. And that's the path to success for his son, too, he says.\n\n\"You can live in this world with that double standard and be successful and have a wonderful life.\"", "keywords": ["words", "family", "wife", "im", "son", "dad", "kids", "children", "think", "thug", "hes", "quarles", "skin"], "polarity": 0.05959308169982327, "subjectivity": 0.3900721968418598},

Under the check box for \"Black or African American,\" the bureau is adding a new space on the census questionnaire for participants to write in their non-Hispanic origins, according to a recent memo from the head of the 2020 census. \"African American,\" \"Jamaican\" and \"Nigerian\" are listed as examples of origins on a questionnaire the bureau is testing for 2020.\n\nThe change means many black people in the U.S. may have to take a closer look at their family trees to answer what can be a thorny question: Where are you really from? While many black immigrants can cite ties to a specific country, that question is difficult, if not impossible, for many U.S.-born African-Americans to answer.\n\nThe bureau has not responded to NPR's questions about why it is making this change to both the \"Black\" category and the \"White\" category,\" which will also include a new write-in area for origins.\n\nBut researchers at the bureau have said they have been trying to respond to requests for \"more detailed, disaggregated data for our diverse American experiences as German, Mexican, Korean, Jamaican, and myriad other identities.\" (The bureau was considering an overhaul to all racial categories that would have added check boxes for the largest ethnic groups and a write-in area for smaller groups. But it would require the Trump administration's approval of an Obama-era proposal to change the federal standards on race and ethnicity data, which census experts say the White House's Office of Management and Budget is not likely to move forward.)\n\n\"Black from everywhere\"\n\nFor Niat Amare, the write-in area will allow her to be more specific about her black identity.\n\n\"I'm African. I identify as black. But I don't see myself as an African-American,\" says Amare, who was born in Ethiopia and now lives in New York City. \"We can't just be black as African-Americans.

Here's How You Can Beat Him.\" So what do you see as your party's most important strategy for 2018 and beyond?\n\nREINES: I think, first of all, is to acknowledge that he's not an easy target. It's hard to think of someone who has had a more calamitous 14 months, and his numbers are showing it. But he's got this core - and he, as I said, is a political Weeble Wobble, where he weebles (ph) and wobbles but doesn't fall down. And I think, most importantly, you know, if this spurs debate about whether I'm right or wrong or whether a two-time, you know, aide to a losing candidate should even have a say - that's a good start.\n\nMARTIN: You wrote, in this piece - it's like a list of bullet points serving as advice for Democrats. One of them reads as follows - quote - \"don't apologize, ever - not over money you took from Harvey Weinstein, not even for attacking the pope. In fact, proactively attack the pope. Your kid is a shoplifter? You're proud of them for exposing inadequate security.\"\n\nSo I get that that's probably tongue in cheek, but do you really think that's...\n\nREINES: Well, not the pope part.\n\nMARTIN: (Laughter).\n\nREINES: I mean, he attacked - he had a Twitter war with the pope. I'm not suggesting it, but that's why I included it. He is impervious to things that most people, most, you know, mere political mortals would succumb to. And I think there are some candidates who believe that the rules have changed for everyone.\n\nMARTIN: That doesn't exactly appeal to our better instincts as Americans.\n\nREINES: Well, but it's also probably not accurate to say that, oh, wow, Donald Trump is getting away with sleeping with a porn star and paying them off. I can start paying off porn stars or be honest about them is wrong. People are not going to get away with that.\n\nMARTIN: On Wednesday morning, we spoke with the head of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, about what Conor Lamb's performance can teach the party. Let's listen to this clip.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nTOM PEREZ: I've had people say to me, well, you either focus on the diverse coalition that is the Democratic Party, or you focus on white, working-class voters. I categorically reject that false choice. We're doing everything everywhere.\n\nMARTIN: Will that work? Is that a good idea?\n\nREINES: It is. And I think Tuesday was a very reassuring day. And yes, the Republicans can throw their talking points that he was a unique candidate and he really was a Republican, blah, blah, blah, but that's not the case. And what was particularly heartening about Tuesday is it's clear that they can't buy their way out of their problems. They spent more than $10 million of party money, and he lost. They can do that when it's one race, a special election months ahead of time. They can't do that dozens of times in November.\n\nMARTIN: Can you give me the top thing, the one thing, Democrats must do to beat him?\n\nREINES: The one thing they've got to do is, I think, take him seriously. But I think it's leave nothing unchecked. And that is something that he does. I don't know how consciously he does it. You know, last year, he came back to the press area on Air Force One, and he blurted out that he doesn't watch television. And everyone thought, well, what is he talking about? The week later, The New York Times wrote a piece about how much television he watches. He knew that that was coming, and he felt the need to just say it out - to just put it out there. He - his people, his supporters, are armed to the teeth with responses. Now, they also have their cries of fake news, which make it easier. But he arms everyone with something to say. And I think that's a huge lesson that people let go.\n\nMARTIN: Philippe Reines, a longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton, thanks for your time.\n\nREINES: No, thank you for having me.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

They should be praying, they should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.\"\n\nPublic opinion remains divided on gun laws. Several polls taken this year show that a bare majority of Americans want to see stricter gun control. A CBS News poll in April showed that 54 percent of adults nationwide want gun laws to be stricter, 33 percent want them left as they are, and 11 percent would like less strict gun laws.\n\nStephen Colbert and James Corden opened their shows on CBS in a similar vein as Kimmel.\n\nCBS/The Late Show With Stephen Colbert YouTube\n\nColbert called for action by Congress on gun control. \"If we are facing pure evil, then by all means offer thoughts and prayers. But think about what you need to do, and then pray for the courage to do it,\" he said.\n\nThe British-born Corden called Sunday's massacre \"the biggest mass shooting in United States history. That's a record that's been set twice since the two-and-a-half years that I've been living in America.\" The 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando had previously been the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nCBS/The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube\n\nCorden cited statistics that 11,660 people have been killed by gun violence in the past 275 days in the U.S., which is noted in running statistics kept by the Gun Violence Archive.\n\n\"Now I come from a place where we don't have shootings at this frequency so it's hard for me to fathom, but it should be hard for everyone to fathom,\" Corden continued. \"Gun violence should not be a staple of American life. Some say it's too early to talk about gun control. For those victims last night, it's far too late.\"\n\nKimmel, who last week forcefully spoke out against GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said he wants his to be a comedy show. \"I hate talking about stuff like this,\" he said. \"I just want to, you know, laugh about things every night, but it seems to increasingly difficult lately.

{"title": "FACT CHECK: Is Chicago Proof That Gun Laws Don't Work?", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/555580598/fact-check-is-chicago-proof-that-gun-laws-don-t-work", "text": "FACT CHECK: Is Chicago Proof That Gun Laws Don't Work?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the wake of the horrific shooting in Las Vegas this week, the White House faced questions about whether President Trump would support stricter gun legislation.\n\nPress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn't give a definite response to these questions, but her statement showed a White House hesitant to create new regulations.\n\n\"I think one of the things we don't want to do is try to create laws that won't stop these types of things from happening,\" Sanders said Monday. \"I think if you look to Chicago where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn't helped there.\"\n\nPointing to Chicago to suggest that gun laws don't work is not a new talking point \u2014 Trump claimed Chicago had \"the toughest gun laws in the United States\" in a 2016 presidential debate; his fellow Republican candidate Chris Christie likewise pointed to Chicago as a place with high crime despite tight gun laws.\n\nAnd the rhetoric goes beyond politicians. The right-wing site Breitbart has on many occasions posted articles with headlines containing the phrase \"gun-controlled Chicago.\"\n\nThis can sound like a potent talking point \u2014 it is a huge city with a notorious crime problem, which Trump already used regularly to talk about creating law and order. It also packs the added rhetorical punch of being closely linked to President Obama, whose actions Trump has worked hard to undo.\n\nBut while gun violence in Chicago is high, the rest of this common talking point doesn't really hold water.\n\nHigh crime and tough gun laws\n\nIt's also true that there were more than 4,000 shooting victims in Chicago in 2016. It's also true that Chicago has suffered a massive amount of gun crime recently. In 2016, homicides in Chicago sharply rose, mostly as a result of gun homicides, as the University of Chicago crime lab found in a January report.\n\nGun homicides in the city rose by 61 percent between 2015 and 2016. That helped make the gun homicide rate in Chicago particularly huge compared to other similar cities. The rate was 25.1 per 100,000 residents in 2016, compared to 14.7 in Philadelphia and just 2.3 in New York.\n\nIt also had a relatively high number of guns recovered \u2014 243 per 100,000 residents. That's roughly on par with Philadelphia and much higher than Los Angeles or New York.\n\nBut it's not true that Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the country, as other fact checkers have also repeatedly found.\n\nIt is true that Illinois has tougher gun laws than many other states. The state is one of seven that requires licenses or permits to buy any firearm, and it's one of five that requires waiting periods for buying any firearm. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks gun laws nationwide, has given the state a B+ for its gun laws.\n\nChicago itself has some tough laws \u2014 there is an assault-weapons ban in Cook County, for example. But it's not true that Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country. At one point, it did have much tougher laws \u2014 it had banned handguns in the city limits, but a 2008 Supreme Court ruling declared that ban unconstitutional, and a 2010 ruling reaffirmed that. The city also had had a gun registry program since 1968, but ended it in 2013 when the state passed a law allowing the concealed carry of weapons.\n\n\"We generally think of California as having the strongest gun laws in the country,\" said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \"The whole state's laws are pretty strong.\"\n\nThe center has given California an A rating and ranks it No. 1 in terms of the tightness of its gun laws. California bans the open carry of guns and requires background checks on private firearm sales, among other things.\n\n\"Some cities go even beyond that,\" Shearer added. \"San Francisco has a safe storage law, requiring that guns kept in the home are kept locked.\"\n\nThat's a regulation that Chicago, for example, does not have.\n\nQuibbling over exactly what part of the U.S. is No. 1 in terms of gun-law strictness, however, isn't the most compelling part of Sanders' statement. She also said that having gun regulations \"certainly hasn't helped\" in Chicago.\n\nThat's a much more controversial claim \u2014 and it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.\n\nState lines don't stop guns\n\nIt's important to remember here that Chicago is very close to two states that have relatively weak gun laws: Wisconsin and Indiana. So while it's easy to pick on Chicago (or any other high-crime city) for its ugly statistics, says one expert, taking bordering states into account weakens this gun-advocacy talking point.\n\n\"It's not a scientific study. It's an anecdote,\" said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University. \"They might have pointed to Washington, D.C., back in the days when D.C. banned handguns and yet had high gun-violence rates. Those bans are only at best partially effective, because the borders are permeable.\"\n\nD.C. borders Virginia, which does not have strong gun laws. (It gets a D from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.)\n\nNeither Wisconsin nor Indiana requires licenses or permits to purchase a gun, for example, nor do they require waiting periods. While Illinois has that B+ rating from the law center, Wisconsin has a C- and Indiana a D-.\n\nAnd there's good evidence that being next-door to those states keeps Chicago criminals well-supplied with guns. A 2015 study of guns in Chicago, co-authored by Cook, found that more than 60 percent of new guns used in Chicago gang-related crimes and 31.6 percent used in non-gang-related crimes between 2009 and 2013 were bought in other states. Indiana was a particularly heavy supplier, providing nearly one-third of the gang guns and nearly one-fifth of the non-gang guns.\n\nOther evidence corroborates this \u2014 a 2014 Chicago Police Department report found that Indiana accounted for 19 percent of all guns recovered by the department between 2009 and 2013.\n\nNew firearms trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released last week likewise shows that Illinois as a whole faces a massive influx of guns. Of around 8,700 firearms recovered in Illinois and for which the bureau found a source state, more than half came from out of state \u2014 1,366, nearly 16 percent, came from Indiana alone.\n\nBy comparison, 82 percent of guns recovered in Indiana and traced were from within Indiana, suggesting that criminals in that state don't have to cross state lines, like those in Illinois, to get their weapons.\n\nAll of this might suggest that criminals will just go to whatever lengths necessary get their hands on guns, regardless of whatever laws are in place.\n\nBut that's the wrong way to think about it, Cook said.\n\n\"No one's in a position to say that Chicago's various special regulations and Illinois's regulations are doing no good,\" he said, \"because we don't know what the homicide rate would be in the absence of those.\n\nSources:\n\n2016 Gun Law State Scorecard.

But the upside for progressive groups is that Trump has also inspired a newly energized movement in protest of his policies. The best example of this so far is the massive Women's March on Washington, D.C., a year ago, a day after Trump's inauguration, and the hundreds of smaller marches across the country on that day and since.\n\nDeirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, which along with Planned Parenthood Action Fund constitutes Planned Parenthood's political operation, says the group has committed an initial investment of $20 million to be used mostly on Senate and gubernatorial contests in eight states.\n\n\"We will be supporting candidates who support reproductive rights,\" Schifeling says, adding that such rights are \"really at stake in the country, especially this year.\" She says \"we support candidates who support access to Planned Parenthood and who support women and all people making their own health care decisions without interference from politicians.\"\n\nFederal funding for Planned Parenthood \u2014 which is not an actual line item in the budget, but rather reimbursement for health care services provided to patients \u2014 has become a perpetual political battle in Washington. Republicans in Congress have long made ending any federal dollars for the organization a campaign issue. But so far, the funding survives.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's target list of states includes Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which were instrumental in Trump's 2016 victory. The others where Planned Parenthood will pour in money and resources are Arizona, Florida, Minnesota and Nevada \u2014 each of which has hotly contested races.\n\nNotably, states so far not on the Planned Parenthood target list are two of the more conservative states, each of which has an incumbent Democratic senator on the ballot this year: Missouri and North Dakota. Both are states Trump won easily and where protecting abortion rights is a more difficult case to make with a more conservative populace.\n\nThis year's Planned Parenthood spending will mostly fund a network of grass-roots volunteers to reach out to voters where health care and the right to an abortion are considered important. That likely means a focus on suburbs and female voters. Schifeling says there will be a \"robust door-to-door canvassing operation,\" but she adds that \"we will also be investing in paid digital and some paid TV [advertising] in key races.\"\n\nVoter turnout will be the key. The money being committed this year is already $5 million greater than the $15 million Planned Parenthood spent on the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nMeanwhile, groups that oppose abortion rights are also expected to be active in many of the same states. The Susan B. Anthony List is one such organization. It has not released a dollar amount for its 2018 political operations, but it too will fund an aggressive door-to-door campaign in key states including Ohio, Florida and Missouri. Part of the argument these groups will use is that Trump has been their friend, that he named a solid conservative, Justice Neil Gorsuch, to the Supreme Court and that such gains need to be protected.\n\nFor Planned Parenthood, a lesson of 2017 \u2014 when voter discontent over the Trump presidency helped fuel a swing of 16 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Republicans to Democrats and a near Democratic takeover \u2014 is that there are opportunities.", "keywords": ["organization", "midterms", "2018", "support", "key", "plans", "parenthood", "states", "major", "political", "list", "planned", "rights", "effort", "trump"], "polarity": 0.15575265643447464, "subjectivity": 0.525814639905549},

But in the time he has spent writing about Civil War re-enactors, he has met many who say they do.\n\nTheir perspectives on the Confederate flag and the legacy of their ancestors prompted Dukes, a writer and radio reporter, to share his own six words with the Race Card Project: \"Must We Forget Our Confederate Ancestors?\"\n\nDukes, a Southerner himself, embedded last year with a group of Civil War re-enactors at the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, and wrote about it in a piece for the Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\n\"I just wanted to see the spectacle of the thing,\" he tells NPR Special Correspondent Michele Norris. The event, a re-enactment of one of the Civil War's most famous battles, \"was going to be like the Woodstock of re-enacting, is what everyone told me. ... I wanted to sort of understand what they got out of it.\"\n\nPart of his motivation, Dukes says, was to connect with re-enactors \"in an environment where I thought people would be comfortable talking about things like the legacy of slavery, and the legacy of Jim Crow and the legacy of racism.\"\n\nAs it turned out, the people he met weren't particularly comfortable talking about those themes, Dukes says. But they did talk when prompted, and \"everybody was kind and everybody was very welcoming,\" he notes.\n\nMany Confederate re-enactors understand, Dukes says, that the Confederate flag is associated with segregation, the KKK and lynchings. \"And invariably people would say, you know, racism was so terrible. It was an abomination. ... But that's not what I'm here to connect with,' \" Dukes says.\n\n'A History, Not A Hate, Issue'\n\nInstead, the re-enactors were there to connect with their ancestors, he says. \"Maybe not run up that exact same hill, but a simulacrum of that hill with the same sounds and the same shouts and the same visual stimulus \u2014 minus the blood and dying. And it still seemed to define their identity.\"\n\n\"I think people tried to distance their ancestors from the guilt associated with slavery, and I also think they tried to implicate everybody else,\" Dukes says. \"So, pointing out, very accurately, that slavery \u2014 the economic system \u2014 relied on the markets and the textile factories and places like that in the North.\"\n\nWhile reporting, Dukes met Sara Smith, a Confederate re-enactor from Dayton, Va. Her great-great-grandfather, Harry N. Smith, fought for the Confederacy at Gettysburg and was wounded in battle.\n\nSara Smith has Confederate flag stickers on the back of her truck \u2014 and says those who see it as a symbol glorifying racism or segregation don't understand the meaning the flag holds for her.\n\n\"I think people need to realize ... it's a history, not a hate, issue,\" Smith told Dukes. \"I think too many people get caught up in the symbol. You know, for us, it doesn't mean the same thing it means to other people. The flag that they get so upset over, was actually not a flag. It was a battle flag. It was what you formed off of to know you were on the right side\" in battle.\n\nSmith doesn't think her great-great-grandfather was fighting to preserve slavery. To her, it's \"the flag her great-great-grandfather carried up that hill in a desperate attempt to maintain his state's freedom from government interference,\" Dukes says.\n\nAnd \"if her great-great-grandfather was a good, noble, brave person who was wounded and then came home, and still lived to be something like 80, and showed so much bravery on the field, and he could carry that flag, why would it be wrong for her to put it on her vehicle?\"\n\n'Willful Innocence'\n\nDukes describes that perspective as \"willful innocence.\" It's a logic \"that says, 'OK, I have the right to love my great-great-grandfather and to admire those things in his life that are admirable, like bravery, like loyalty, like accomplishments, like survival. And because he must have been a good person, then the cause he fought for and the flag that he held must not have been a bad cause.' \"\n\nDukes says that perspective led some of the re-enactors to make the following assertion: \"People who are offended by [the flag] just don't understand what the Confederate flag really means.\"\n\nThe Confederate flag holds different significance for other Americans, as well, Dukes says. While some Southerners are well aware that the flag is often perceived as racist \u2014 and display it anyway \u2014 others display it to demonstrate their mistrust in federal government and as a symbol of resistance to federal regulation.\n\nAnd for others, Dukes says, the Confederate flag signifies an awareness that rural white Southerners, and rural Americans more generally, are often stereotyped as backward.\n\n\"I think the flag has transcended Southern identity to become [linked to] a kind of rural impoverished identity, too,\" says Dukes, who says he has even seen people display the Confederate flag in rural Maine.\n\n\"I think there are poor people in the rural South and North and all over the country who do feel like they're stereotyped and they don't have everything ... including respect ... that's due to them.\n\n\"I'm not sure that waving a Confederate flag is a great way to get that respect back \u2014 and often it is enacting the stereotype that they're trying to escape \u2014 but I do think it's a legitimate complaint nevertheless.\"\n\nDukes says he enjoyed meeting re-enactors like Smith, and doesn't \"begrudge them their weekends clad in gray, remembering their ancestors, hoisting libations and waving the battle flag,\" he writes in Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\nBut, Dukes writes, \"better to roll the flag up at the end of the weekend and leave it in the trunk until the next re-enactment. This is the 21st century, and the Confederate flag has no place in our time.\"", "keywords": ["words", "greatgreatgrandfather", "dukes", "confederate", "rural", "think", "understand", "flag", "forget", "reenactors", "smith", "ancestors"], "polarity": 0.14372959183673473, "subjectivity": 0.4410844671201814},

I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn't agree with that. Then I took some time and I quit.\"\n\nIn that four-day sweep through Northern California, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers arrested 232 people \u2014 but high-level federal officials, including President Trump, said Schaaf was to blame for 864 more people not being arrested. They pointed to her public warning of a pending raid, which she issued on Feb. 24, just as the operation was about to begin.\n\nICE agents had targeted more than 1,000 people in the sweep. After the raid, a Homeland Security official said it's common for a large-scale immigration sweep to net about a third of its targets, as member station KQED reports.\n\nTrump called what Schaaf did \"a disgrace,\" saying her warning was the sole reason that hundreds of people escaped arrest. His remarks amplified attacks by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and acting ICE Director Thomas D. Homan. Their claims were questioned by critics \u2014 and now by Schwab, a veteran public affairs officer who had worked at the Defense Department and NASA.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption The Washington Post/Getty Images The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n\"I didn't feel like fabricating the truth to defend ourselves against [the mayor's] actions was the way to go about it,\" Schwab told the Chronicle. \"We were never going to pick up that many people. To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren't picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.\"\n\nIn his attack on Schaaf, Trump said 85 percent of the targeted immigrants had criminal records. But when KQED asked ICE to explain why the targeted people had been classified as threats to public safety, a spokeswoman cited only five, of the 864, who had been convicted of serious crimes.\n\nFrom KQED:\n\n\"Of the 232 people arrested, ICE stated that 115, or just under half, had 'prior felony convictions for serious and violent offenses' or past convictions for 'significant or multiple misdemeanors.' The other half had no criminal history. \"When asked to specify how many arrestees were felons, spokeswoman Danielle Bennett would only respond, 'all of those arrested were arrested for being in violation of immigration law.' \"\n\nIn addition to sparking criticism from the Trump administration, the case also prompted the government to look into whether Schaaf may have broken any laws by sounding the alarm about the pending raid \u2014 another front in the clash between federal officials and the leaders of sanctuary cities.\n\nSchwab has now quit his job as a Homeland Security spokesman in San Francisco \u2014 but that shouldn't be taken to mean that he agrees with what Schaaf did.\n\n\"Personally I think her actions were misguided and not responsible,\" Schwab told CNN. \"I think she could have had other options. But to blame her for 800 dangerous people out there is just false. It's a false statement because we never pick up 100 percent of our targets. And to say they're a type of dangerous criminal is also misleading.\"\n\nOf the battle over how to properly characterize the events, Schwab said, \"I've never been in this situation in 16, almost 17 years in government where someone asked me to deflect when we absolutely knew something was awry \u2014 when the data was not correct.\"\n\nAfter the raid, Homan accused Schaaf of creating a dangerous situation for ICE agents. And when he announced the immigration arrests last month, Homan included this jab at the Oakland mayor:\n\n\"However, 864 criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large in the community, and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor's irresponsible decision. Unlike the politicians who attempt to undermine ICE's critical mission, our officers will continue to fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety.\"\n\nOn March 7, Sessions extrapolated on Homan's remarks, converting the ICE leader's rough estimate that \"some of\" the 864 targets had escaped because of Schaaf into a statement that 800 failed arrests lay at the mayor's feet:\n\n\"According to Acting Director Homan, ICE failed to make 800 arrests that they would have made if the mayor had not acted as she did. \"Those are 800 wanted aliens that are now at large in that community \u2014most are wanted criminals that ICE will now have to pursue with more difficulty in more dangerous situations, all because of one mayor's irresponsible action.\"\n\nTrump said in a Cabinet meeting, \"What the mayor of Oakland did the other day was a disgrace. Where they had close to 1,000 people, ready to be gotten, ready to be taken off the streets. ... The mayor of Oakland went out, and she went out and warned them all: scatter.\"\n\nAlso last week, Sessions announced a lawsuit against California for impeding federal immigration enforcement and said, \"You can be sure I'm going to use every power I have to stop that.\"\n\nVisiting Sacramento, Sessions said, \"So here's my message for Mayor Schaaf: How dare you? How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical open borders agenda?\"\n\nNational How San Francisco's Sheriff Is Helping Undocumented Immigrants Find Lawyers How San Francisco's Sheriff Is Helping Undocumented Immigrants Find Lawyers Listen \u00b7 4:27 4:27\n\nIn response, Schaaf said, \"How dare you vilify members of our community by trying to frighten the American public into thinking that all undocumented residents are dangerous criminals? ... How dare you distort the reality about declining violent crime rates in a diverse, sanctuary city like Oakland to advance a racist agenda?\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown criticized Sessions and called on him to apologize, saying his claims about Schaaf were \"simply not true\" and were politically motivated.\n\nThen came the remarks from Trump \u2014 and another response from Oakland's mayor.\n\n\"I'm proud to live in a country where everyone can criticize elected officials,\" Schaaf said in response to a reporter's question about Trump.\n\nThe war of words with Washington has put a new spotlight on Schaaf, 52, who took office in 2015 and is now running for a second term.\n\n\"An insult from Donald Trump is a compliment to a California Democrat,\" political consultant Jim Ross tells The Mercury News in San Jose.\n\nThe newspaper also spoke to California Republican strategist Matt Rexroad, who said: \"I can't think of a single district that includes the City of Oakland, or any statewide office, where that would be a disadvantage.

NPR's David Greene speaks to New Yorker staff writer Adam Davidson about what to expect from Kudlow.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nThere are conflicting reports about who may be the next person to leave the Trump administration, but we are sure as we can be about a high-profile arrival. Larry Kudlow will be the new head of the National Economic Council. This is a critical role in developing American economic policy. The person in that job is supposed to be an honest broker and tee up many points of view for the president to consider. And let's turn now to Adam Davidson, who's a staff writer for The New Yorker who covers economics, also a well-known voice on NPR's air. Adam Davidson, nice to talk to you again.\n\nADAM DAVIDSON: Yeah. Hey, David. Great to hear from you.\n\nGREENE: Yeah. Well, let's talk a little bit about Kudlow. I mean, I know he served in the Reagan administration. He's sort of known as a supply-sider when it comes to economics. So, I mean, I guess one big question - do he and Donald Trump see eye-to-eye on the economy?\n\nDAVIDSON: Oh, absolutely not. I think they have fundamentally different views of how the economy works.\n\nGREENE: OK.\n\nDAVIDSON: Kudlow is an interesting character. I mean, he really developed a very firm set of ideas very early and has not changed them at all even when the facts on the ground - you know, recessions, deep financial crises, a general lack of wage growth for the middle class - have proved him wrong, at least in the eyes of many others. He has stuck to a very narrow set of prescriptions for the economy. No matter what's going on - cut taxes, lower regulation. Now, Donald Trump, of course, likes that.\n\nGREENE: He likes those two things, yeah.\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah, those two things he likes. But Kudlow is very much, in Donald Trump's horrible phrase, a globalist. He believes that the best approach to the U.S. is to be extremely open to the world to trade as freely as possible, that global trade is a - is not a zero-sum game where one side wins and the other side loses.\n\nGREENE: So no fan of tariffs, as we've been hearing - I mean, the president has proposed some that he has already spoken out against. So what is that relationship going to be like if that's going to be - tariffs are going to be in the news in coming weeks and months?\n\nDAVIDSON: This is going to be very interesting to watch because Kudlow, just two weeks ago, wrote a column in The National Review gently - very respectfully and gently telling Donald Trump, you are wrong about tariffs. Tariffs are disastrous. They're what we do to North Korea and call them sanctions. And his job is going to be to implement Trump's tariffs. It's going to be a grim, grim job. He's going to be spending much of his time on the phone with - and in person meeting with trade ministers from other countries and arguing and representing this pro-tariff Trump view. And Kudlow, you know, this is a big personality. This is a famous guy. I don't see him enjoying the role of suppressing his lifelong beliefs in favor of Trump. I expect this one to be pretty interesting to watch.\n\nGREENE: Well, he has been slammed by critics, A, for not having any Ph.D. in economics. He's not an economist. And a lot of his critics have said that he's made these bold economic predictions in the past that just don't pan out. So given that record, what is President Trump looking for if he's bringing him in?\n\nDAVIDSON: Yeah. A lot of people consider Kudlow the wrongest (ph) man in the field of economics, and it's a field he might not even be in. Just a delightful, amazing list of every time he's been wrong. The problem is how he's wrong. Every economic forecaster is wrong a lot. You know, it's the kind of thing where if you're right 10 or 20 percent of the time, you could consider yourself doing pretty well. It's that Kudlow has the exact same view no matter what. He sees cutting taxes as the solution and the only solution. And if there's economic growth, it's because someone at some point cut taxes. If there is economic malaise, it's because someone didn't cut taxes.\n\nGREENE: All right, Adam, we'll sadly have to stop there. Adam Davidson from The New Yorker.

And if he doesn't, let me know, and I'll attack him.\"\n\nThose are the words of (now) President Trump, but they're not from any current controversy. They're from 2009, from an interview in the ESPN documentary Small Potatoes: Who Killed The USFL?, which aired that same year. Trump is talking about Charley Steiner, the longtime ESPN sportscaster who's now the play-by-play radio announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 1980s, Steiner was the announcer for the New Jersey Generals, the football team Trump had bought that was part of the upstart USFL, a professional football league that lasted three seasons playing in the spring instead of, like the NFL, in the fall.\n\nThe words come shortly after filmmaker Mike Tollin tells Trump something that Steiner said regarding his purchase of the Generals in 1983, in the league's second year: \"[Trump] figured that he could buy his way onto the back page of the New York Post, he could move to Page Six, the gossip page, and then ultimately, the front page. Donald Trump was no longer a Donald, but the Donald.\"\n\nAs you know, the part about making it to the front page eventually came true, though Steiner probably wouldn't have predicted how.\n\nSmall Potatoes, which is available to rent on streaming services, provides some interesting additional context \u2014 along with his flirtation with buying the Buffalo Bills shortly before his 2016 presidential campaign began \u2014 for Trump's recent condemnation of NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality. Trump has gone so far as to proclaim via Twitter that owners should prohibit these protests and should fire anyone who engages in them. It's worth remembering that his history with the NFL is long. (So, in fact, is his history with ESPN, which made this documentary he greatly disliked, and with whom he also got into it recently over ESPN commentator Jemele Hill calling him a white supremacist.)\n\nTollin's thesis in Small Potatoes \u2014 which later earned him a public feud over the film with Trump that did take place on Page Six \u2014 is that the USFL was killed by Trump's stubborn insistence on the doomed idea of moving USFL football to the fall to compete directly with the NFL. Players interviewed for the film, including stars like Jim Kelly and Steve Young, say they had a feeling the push to the fall was a bad idea. The USFL was small but growing. Why throw yourself against the incredibly powerful NFL? But Trump didn't want to coexist as a smaller league and wait to see what happened. He went after a bigger prize.\n\nTrump became the public face of a lawsuit against the NFL by the USFL in 1986, arguing that the NFL constituted a monopoly that, among other things, prevented the USFL from getting fall television contracts. Ultimately, the jury believed that the monopoly existed, but not that the USFL had been damaged by it in the way it claimed. It awarded the USFL $3. One possible explanation for the lack of damages? The NFL had argued that the USFL had planned not to actually play separately in the fall, but to force the NFL to merge with it and adopt at least some of its teams. That could mean the USFL wasn't really harmed by not getting TV contracts it never intended to get.\n\nThe verdict was for $3 plus interest, actually \u2014 a check for $3.76 that Tollin has on hand and gives to Trump during the prickly 2009 interview. The tiny verdict \u2014 the arguably empty victory \u2014 quickly led to the USFL folding altogether.\n\nBecause political lenses can be so disorienting, it can be worthwhile to look back at documents from before politics really dominated a person's image. Here, Tollin makes an argument in 2009 that Trump was impatient and overeager for a confrontation with the NFL. And no less a figure of the 1980s than Burt Reynolds, who was also involved with the league, says in an interview that Trump's \"dream was to be in the National Football League. And they didn't want him.\"\n\nThat's not the way Trump sees the story or his interest in the league, and he's steadfast in his arguments to Tollin that he was right, that spring football was never going to be a success. What would have happened if the league had stayed in the spring and tried to grow gradually is speculation, for both men.\n\nAt the end of the 2009 interview with Tollin, while taking off his microphone, Trump asks Tollin whether he agrees or disagrees with Trump's thinking about what the league should have done. Tollin suggests that he thinks the league could have carried on for a while playing in the spring, had it continued as it was. \"It would have been small potatoes,\" Trump says, patting Tollin on the shoulder. \"Have a good time.\"\n\nThe documentary \"Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL?\" can be found as an episode within Volume 1 of ESPN's series 30 For 30, which is available to rent on platforms including iTunes, Amazon and Google Play.", "keywords": ["league", "small", "tollin", "football", "potatoes", "page", "trumps", "long", "usfl", "trump", "nfl", "donald"], "polarity": 0.033650629673356955, "subjectivity": 0.373974321133412},

America was built on her citizens. ... Look at the 19th century. What built America's called the American system, from Hamilton to Polk to Henry Clay to Lincoln to the Roosevelts. [It was] a system of protection of our manufacturing, financial system that lends to manufacturers, OK, and the control of our borders. Economic nationalism is what this country was built on. The American system.\" \u2013 Steve Bannon\n\nPresident Trump's former strategic adviser offered this riff about American history on CBS's 60 Minutes. He was responding to interviewer Charlie Rose, who said that \"people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy. That's what immigration has been in America.\" Bannon said he was \"dead wrong.\"\n\nSo let's explore: Does the history Bannon cited support his case?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nFirst: Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. He was born in the West Indies. In the 18th century he fought for his adopted country in war (as immigrants often have) and then, as treasury secretary, he contributed immensely to his adopted country's economy (as immigrants often have). He argued for the government to pay Revolutionary War debts, dreamed up a sophisticated financial system, and ended up on the $10 bill. Even in the 21st century, he continues to generate economic activity as the subject of a Broadway musical.\n\nBannon is close enough in calling Hamilton a citizen, since he was present at the founding of the country \u2014 although all Founding Fathers were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, who arrived in the territory of native nations. This illustrates the essential problem in claiming the country was built by citizens and not immigrants: Immigrants often contributed and also became citizens.\n\nIt's meaningful that Bannon cites Abraham Lincoln, too, in his argument about immigrants. In 1862, Lincoln signed legislation supporting construction of a transcontinental railroad, which began a few years later. It was difficult to find laborers willing to work in harsh conditions, so railroad executives hired immigrants. Chinese workers were among those who laid tracks over the mountains from the west, until they met crews of Irish laborers coming from the east. Their meeting in Utah was an iconic American moment.\n\nImmigrants contributed more than brawn. During the Civil War, Confederate rebels launched the Virginia, a seemingly invulnerable ironclad warship. President Lincoln's government responded with its own ironclad, called the Monitor, so innovative that it became the ancestor of all modern warships. It was designed by a brilliant engineer named John Ericsson, a Swedish immigrant.\n\nAs a politician, Lincoln was forced to address resistance to immigration. A powerful anti-immigrant movement rose up in the 1840s and '50s against Irish Catholics. The Know-Nothings, as they were called, won many elections, but Lincoln declined to join them. \"I am not a Know-Nothing,\" Lincoln wrote. \"That is certain. How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.\"\n\nBannon also asserts that 19th century Americans focused on \"the control of our borders.\" That is the opposite of the case. Americans were repeatedly moving beyond their borders. American settlers captured much of Tennessee from American Indians; they took parts of Florida from Spain; and in the most audacious move of all, sheared off Texas from Mexico. In each case some of the Americans involved could have been labeled \"illegal immigrants.\" One of the presidents Bannon referenced, James K. Polk, confirmed the annexation of Texas by going to war against Mexico. Some Mexicans perforce became Americans, because the borders had moved past them.\n\nBannon also cites specific 19th century economic policies. He is correct that there really was an \"American System.\" Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky made that his brand name for a basket of programs. Clay supported tariffs on imports to protect American industry. He supported internal improvements, such as roads and canals. And he supported the creation of a national bank (an idea borrowed from the immigrant Hamilton).\n\nClay's system was immensely appealing to many Americans \u2014 Lincoln among them. It set the terms of national debate for decades. But tariffs that Clay supported also caused intense political conflict, and were denounced as special interest deals for manufacturers. When South Carolina first defied federal authority around 1830, decades before the Civil War, the dispute was not over slavery but a tariff. Then as now, there were arguments for and against any given tariff. The arguments against them are ones Bannon has employed in other contexts. A protective tariff empowers the government to interfere in the economy, and demands supreme wisdom by government officials to avoid unforeseen consequences. Tariffs may become tools of what Bannon has described as \"the administrative state,\" which he proposed to \"deconstruct\" when in the White House.\n\nThe \"administrative state\" argument was also used against Clay's Bank of the United States \u2014 it was described as a corrupt and unconstitutional exercise of government power. Who made this case? Andrew Jackson, a president Bannon reveres and compares to Donald Trump. Jackson also famously vetoed Clay-supported road building. The fight between Jackson and Clay was part of an eternal American debate over the scope of government. In his use of history, Bannon has favored both sides of this argument.\n\nThe 19th century was a time of tremendous growth and ferment in the United States, when Americans were wrestling with some of the same questions we face now: Who are we? What does our country stand for? And who counts as an American?\n\nBannon is correct to find this history relevant, though perhaps not the way he intends. He's right that Americans built a powerful country in the 19th century. But that country was diverse, fed off immigration, was constantly changing, and was not really walled off from the world. Any suggestion otherwise is factually wrong.\n\nSteve Inskeep is co-host of NPR's Morning Edition and is writing a book on America's 19th century westward expansion.", "keywords": ["check", "kind", "lincoln", "war", "bannons", "america", "century", "system", "american", "steve", "1800s", "immigrants", "bannon", "country", "19th", "fact", "americans"], "polarity": 0.14430465367965367, "subjectivity": 0.4239989177489178},

McConnell said he hopes to vote on changes to the background check system for most gun purchases but did not provide a timeline or any further details.\n\n\"We'd love to do that at some point,\" McConnell said. \"I'm hoping there is a way forward.\"\n\nThe lack of commitment is the surest sign yet that Congress does not plan to quickly address gun access, despite pressure from the White House and survivors of last month's deadly shooting at a Florida high school.\n\nThere is no plan for any action on gun legislation ahead of the two-week Easter recess at the end of March. The Senate will next take up Idaho GOP Sen. Mike Crapo's bipartisan legislation to ease bank regulations. The Senate also plans to vote this month on Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman's legislation to combat sex trafficking, and Congress must pass a sweeping spending package by March 23.\n\nThere is no room in the agenda for guns, unless senators reach agreement on legislation that could move through the Senate via an expedited process known as unanimous consent. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is opposed to any new restrictions on gun rights, said he did not believe that kind of consensus was within reach. \"Look, we've got a lot of disagreement on the Republican side, and I would be surprised if something moved anytime soon,\" he said.\n\nWidespread confusion\n\nThe sharp departure was the result of widespread confusion on Capitol Hill over guns. Republicans spent the day Thursday struggling to respond to a set of vague instructions Trump laid out during a televised meeting at the White House.\n\nThat meeting followed a familiar pattern for many lawmakers who are trying to write and pass legislation that can meet Trump's shifting approval. Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president.\n\nOver the course of the hourlong broadcast Trump seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles, positions generally anathema to congressional Republicans. He also suggested pre-emptively taking guns away from potentially dangerous people, a policy that might draw significant legal challenges.\n\n\"I don't know, you saw it, right? It was wild,\" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a Republican. \"I think the president is going to have to narrow his list of what he'd like to see addressed and figure out what's realistic.\"\n\nThe disconnect between Trump and congressional Republicans on core philosophical issues on display this week, coupled with the lingering partisan anger between the two parties following the failed immigration talks, is quickly lowering already dim expectations that 2018 will result in much legislative output.\n\nAdding to the confusion, however, Trump and Vice President Pence met Thursday with Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association's lobbying arm. The president tweeted that it was a \"Good (Great) meeting ...\" and Cox said in a tweet after the meeting that \"POTUS & VPOTUS support he Second Amendment, support strong due process and don't want gun control.\"\n\nThe only must-pass measure on the agenda is the spending bill still being drafted to finalize the appropriations process for the year that, once passed, will free up lawmakers to focus their efforts on what is quickly overtaking Capitol Hill: the battle for control of Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans say they all agree that something needs to be done to curb gun violence, but there is little, if any, consensus on the best way to do that while still maintaining gun rights. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters Thursday that he is not inclined to support any of the numerous gun-related bills that have been floated in recent days.\n\n\"I'm not inclined to do anything right now except to see what comes up,\" Shelby said. \"We all are interested in our children being safe in schools; we're all interested in the communities being safe. It's how do we get there?\"\n\nTrump often acknowledges that it's hard to pass any legislation in Congress, let alone laws to curb gun rights. But many lawmakers, including some Republicans, say Trump's own statements make the already difficult task of passing gun legislation even harder.\n\nThe meeting concluded with Trump asking lawmakers to go back and talk about the extensive list of proposals floated at the meeting, and without a White House endorsement of any specific plan.\n\n\"Element of unpredictability\"\n\nPennsylvania Republican Rep. Ryan Costello told NPR's Morning Edition that he worries that kind of broad directive makes it harder for Congress to focus its attention on specific legislation that could pass and eventually become law.\n\n\"There's still an element of unpredictability on what the White House is willing to lean on from a gun safety reform measure,\" Costello said. \"There was a bit of contradiction in what he said.\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the leading lawmakers working on a proposal to update the criminal background check system, shared similar concerns Wednesday after the meeting adjourned. Cornyn told reporters that it is his experience that passing these measures is harder than it sounds.\n\n\"I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,\" Cornyn said. \"He's a unique president and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.\"\n\nShock at tariff announcement\n\nRepublicans still reeling from the fallout of Trump's conflicting comments during Wednesday's gun meeting were again taken by surprise Thursday with the White House announcement of impending tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The decision upends long-standing GOP orthodoxy on trade policy and provoked fears among senators of a trade war with China and other traditional allies that threatens to harm the U.S. economy more than tariffs promise to help.\n\n\"Every time you do this you get a retaliation, and agriculture is the No. 1 target,\" said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. \"I think this is terribly unproductive for the ag economy.\" China is already signaling it could retaliate against U.S. sorghum exports. Kansas is the country's top sorghum producer.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the president's decision is counter to the view of the Senate GOP Conference, which has in prior meetings urged Trump not to impose these tariffs. \"I think every Republican is pretty well on the same side of the page from that standpoint, resisting what [Trump] and his trade advisers were talking about,\" Johnson said. \"We have been talking to the administration almost in a unanimous fashion, warning against protectionist measures, warning against these types of tariffs.\"", "keywords": ["meeting", "white", "sen", "gun", "legislation", "senate", "week", "think", "measures", "vote", "republicans", "trump", "president", "befuddled"], "polarity": 0.10559586007861871, "subjectivity": 0.41759603423396524},

Today, many of us celebrate by going out drinking and acting out the very stereotypes the day was created to combat.\n\nOn the other hand, 150 years ago nativists in the U.S. were burning Irish Catholic churches to the ground. Today on St. Patrick's Day, Americans of all backgrounds wear green, drink Guinness, and put on pins that say \"Kiss me I'm Irish.\" There's something beautiful about that.\n\nIn recent years, holidays associated with various other immigrant groups have begun to gain mainstream acceptance, most notably Cinco de Mayo, which has followed a similar path as St. Patrick's Day \u2013 started by activists to celebrate Mexican culture, embraced by people just looking for a good time.\n\nLunar New Year and Dia De Los Muertos are also well on their way.\n\nWhen one culture's holiday becomes everyone's excuse to party, what's gained and what's lost? And how does it feel when it's your holiday?\n\nTo find out, I go to a Chinese New Year party with no Chinese people and a Passover Seder with no Jewish people for this week's episode of The Sporkful podcast. Plus, comedian Jenny Yang offers advice for marketing new holidays:\n\nGentile Passover\n\n\"We're going to read from Exodus tonight,\" explains Tiffany Wang, as she welcomes me to Gentile Passover, an annual gathering she and her sister, Charlene Wang de Chen, host.\n\n\"We don't have a Haggada,\" Tiffany continues, referring to the book Jews use as a guide at Passover Seder, or ritual meal, \"but we know the Passover story because we grew up in a Christian household.\"\n\nThis Gentile Passover tradition began 10 years ago. Charlene was living in Beijing and read about how President Obama was hosting a Passover in the White House. She decided she'd host one, too, which is no surprise if you know how she and Tiffany were raised.\n\nThey're Chinese-American, but every St. Patrick's Day their mom made corned beef, potatoes and cabbage.\n\n\"We love eating,\" says Charlene, \"and we just love learning more about cultures through their food traditions. That's obviously the funnest way to learn about it.\"\n\nCharlene scrambled around Beijing to gather the symbolic foods needed for a Passover Seder \u2013 salt water for tears, bitter herbs for the bitterness of slavery, and of course, matzo (unleavened bread), because Jews were fleeing the Egyptians and didn't have time for our bread to rise. (That last item required a few phone calls to obtain.)\n\nThe first Gentile Passover was a big success.\n\n\"Everyone was so down for it, on an occasion none of them traditionally celebrate, which I thought was awesome,\" Charlene recalls. \"Everyone was bringing this openness.\"\n\nWhen I joined last year's Gentile Passover, I was the only Jewish person in the room. We were joined by Charlene's husband, Tony Chen, Tiffany's fianc\u00e9, and two friends, Tim Cotton and Anne-Laure Py.\n\nThey proudly showed me the two different types of matzo they had purchased, and served me a delicious cocktail made with Campari and Manischewitz, the latter being a Jewish ceremonial wine that is the best wine because it's filled with sugar.\n\nThe cocktail was fantastic, and the menu looked promising. Tiffany and Charlene had prepared matzo ball soup and short ribs, which made me very happy, because I've long advocated replacing the more traditional brisket with short ribs at Passover and all year round.\n\nThere was a beautiful Seder plate, and even though I'm not especially religious myself, I was very impressed with the research and work they had done to respect the holiday's customs.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Pashman/NPR Dan Pashman/NPR\n\nI did cringe a bit when they told me they had rugelach, a Jewish pastry, for dessert. Most Jews would not serve rugelach at Passover because it contains leavened bread. Charlene and Tiffany knew that, but, they said, rugelach is delicious. I couldn't argue with that.\n\nWe read the story of the Jews being freed from slavery in Egypt, as recounted in Exodus, and dinner was served. We skipped rituals like dipping parsley in salt water and putting bitter herbs on matzo. And that felt strange.\n\nAt my family's Passover Seder, we use a Haggada written by my wife, Janie, that I love very much. But the part of it I know best is page 21. Because page 21 is where it says, \"Dinner is served.\" From the time we open that book I keep thinking, \"Please get me to page 21!\"\n\nIn other words, I'm often eager to rush through the rituals. At Gentile Passover, I found myself missing them. It turns out those traditions mean more to me than I realized.\n\nAnd while the experience of watching people who aren't Jewish observe their version of customs I grew up with was in some ways strange and unsettling, it was also beautiful.\n\nI wondered about what my great-grandparents, who came to America from Eastern Europe, would think if they saw me celebrating Passover with two Chinese-American Christians, a Chinese-born Muslim, a Sri Lankan-American, and two white European Christians.\n\nThe meal itself was fantastic. The matzo balls were just the right combo of soft on the outside and firm inside, and the short ribs braised in charoset were savory and sweet, reaffirming my belief in their superiority over brisket.\n\nOne key Passover tradition is that you're supposed to ask questions \u2013 big questions like \"What's the point of all this?\" After the meal I asked everyone, when we celebrate other people's holidays, what's gained and what's lost?\n\n\"We're trying to understand other cultures, but in doing that and changing it, you dilute them,\" says Charlene and Tiffany's friend Tim. \"A more pure and authentic Seder would be less accessible to me, who's not Jewish. So this is more accessible to me, but it also does change it. So there's a tension there. While it's very positive that we learn all these things, I can see why some people get worried that if you do that to the final degree, it ceases to exist as its own tradition and it becomes this amorphous globalized thing that doesn't really mean anything.\"\n\n\"Something I've thought about for a long time is, How Chinese are my kids going to be?\" adds Tiffany. \"And the answer is, less than me. And I'm less than my parents. I'm going to marry a Sri Lankan man. My children are going to be Chinese and Sri Lankan, and very American at the same time. So there will be a dilution of our culture. That can feel like something you can mourn. But then whatever we create from that may also be something new and exciting.\"\n\nDan Pashman hosts the James Beard Award-nominated food podcast The Sporkful, which this week features the episode \"Other People's Holidays.\" It's available in Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever you listen.", "keywords": ["charlene", "matzo", "im", "tiffany", "holidays", "seder", "whats", "excuse", "passover", "party", "jewish", "going", "cultures"], "polarity": 0.1609808832122882, "subjectivity": 0.3886656410623352},

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris dips into those stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThis story is about the burden of history, and how one decides to deal with it. Do we accept history as it's handed down, challenge it to command a better understanding \u2014 or ignore it as a way to find a peace of mind?\n\nCarol Zachary of Washington, D.C., has puzzled over fragments of memories from her childhood \u2014 bits of mysterious and uncomfortable history \u2014 for years. This history centers on an envelope she was given by her grandfather when she was 9 years old, and it led her to submit her six words to The Race Card Project: \"Grandfather's poker gift, a hanging invitation.\"\n\nZachary approached NPR's Michele Norris, curator of The Race Card Project, with that same envelope and its contents \u2014 items she has held onto for decades. Inside the envelope was an invitation to a hanging of three African-American men in Montana in 1917, executions her grandfather had witnessed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Carol Zachary Courtesy of Carol Zachary\n\nZachary's story begins at her grandparents' home in White Sulphur Springs, Mont., where she was visiting for the summer from Idaho. Having sassed her grandmother one day, she was punished by being forced to stay home with her infirm grandfather while the rest of the family went on a fishing trip.\n\n\"I was left with a grandfather \u2014 who has emphysema, who can't really speak much anymore \u2014 in a dark, dank cabin for an afternoon,\" Zachary recalls. \"This man, who had no idea what to do with ... girls at all, finally said to me in this barely audible voice: 'Go get a deck of cards.' \"\n\nHe taught her nine card stud. \"He never threw the game. And at the end of the afternoon, I won. I won my first game against my grandfather,\" Zachary says, beaming with pride.\n\nHer grandfather was proud of her, too, and to show his pride, he went and got that envelope for her. As she opened the double envelope, she saw what looked like a formal invitation to an execution, as well as three black-and-white photographs \u2014 pictures of the men to be hanged.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Walter Ray Watson/NPR Walter Ray Watson/NPR\n\n\"Well, I was a tomboy. I was curiosity with a 'C.' I just started to pepper him with questions \u2014 'Oh, Grandpa, what was it like? Did they lose their heads? Did their eyes bug out? Did everybody cheer? Did everybody cry?' \" Zachary says.\n\n\"And he raised a hand, which told me to shut up. And he said three words: 'It was awful.' \"\n\nAfter meeting Zachary, The Race Card Project team conducted its own reporting and discovered that invitations to hangings in the early 20th century were fairly common. \"In fact, in Montana, they were required by law,\" Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep. \"And Carol Zachary's grandfather was a county auditor, so he, by law, would have been required to attend that hanging.\"\n\nThe photos that accompany the invitation \u2014 of the three men sentenced to be hanged \u2014 are each marked with the man's name and nickname. Curiously, Norris says, they don't look like mug shots. The men are dressed up. They are wearing ties and suit jackets. \"They look like professionally lit portraitures,\" Norris notes.\n\nZachary told The Race Card project that she has always wondered whether the event was a lynching. But when she traveled to White Sulphur Springs to learn more, she found out that the hanging was legal \u2014 a fact independently confirmed by The Race Card Project team.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives\n\nEven so, Zachary still wonders how, or if, race may have been a factor in the case.\n\n\"It was a legal hanging,\" Norris explains. \"These three men were arrested for a murder that took place in the commission of a robbery. Very little is known about these men. They were said to have been railroad workers. They were called hobos in some accounts, itinerant workers. And it was the first legal triple-hanging in the state of Montana. It was a pretty big deal.\"\n\nIn reporting this story, the Race Card Project team also learned that there had been some controversy around the execution \u2014 there had even been an effort to commute the sentence.\n\n\"We came across a very thorough newspaper account in the Anaconda Standard, an article published in Butte, Mont., on the day of the hanging \u2014 Feb. 16, 1917,\" Norris says. \"The article quoted then-Montana Gov. Samuel Stewart at length, and the governor himself said he was concerned that perhaps the race of these men may have been a factor. And he determined that it was not, based on the evidence that was presented at trial. He denied clemency [and] the three men were hanged all at the same time on the morning of Feb. 16.\"\n\nWhile the team helped uncover some of the story behind these six words, and the invitation, there is still more that's not known \u2014 and that still troubles Zachary.\n\n\"It's not at all a case-closed issue for Carol Zachary. There's still a lot of mystery involving this,\" Norris says. \"The mystery of those photos and why they looked like that. The mystery of why her grandfather gave her the envelope and, despite the fact that it was a legal hanging, said it was awful. She wrestles with this. And she's careful to point out that she's not trying to say that this hanging was a mistake or some kind of miscarriage of justice, but she says it just feels incomplete to her.\"\n\nWhen Zachary first saw that envelope as a 9-year old, she was fascinated by it. But now, when she talks about the process of pulling out that envelope as an adult, she approaches it with something much closer to dread.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what I saw. I remembered them as being very fierce, but as I laid them out there [years later], they were three stunningly beautiful young black men,\" Zachary says.\n\nAs an adult who has lived a life, has children of her own and has her own opinions about the death penalty, she looks at these pictures today and wonders about the message in that gesture \u2014 the fact that her grandfather gave her the envelope.\n\n\"One of the things she wonders is if he wanted her to understand that some things shouldn't make us feel good,\" Norris says. \"That even if this was a legally sanctioned hanging, that, in the end, it's the taking of someone's life \u2014 and some things shouldn't feel satisfying, even when they're dictated or sanctioned by law.\"", "keywords": ["family", "zachary", "envelope", "disturbing", "grandfather", "project", "norris", "carol", "card", "wrestles", "race", "hanging", "memento", "men", "woman"], "polarity": 0.08309132996632998, "subjectivity": 0.4417508417508417},

Gregory (R)/National Geographic\n\nIf National Geographic's April issue was going to be entirely devoted to the subject of race, the magazine decided it had better take a good hard look at its own history.\n\nEditor in Chief Susan Goldberg asked John Edwin Mason, a professor of African history and the history of photography at the University of Virginia, to dive into the magazine's nearly 130-year archive and report back.\n\nWhat Mason found was a long tradition of racism in the magazine's coverage: in its text, its choice of subjects, and in its famed photography.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption National Geographic National Geographic\n\n\"[U]ntil the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers,\" writes Goldberg in the issue's editor letter, where she discusses Mason's findings. \"Meanwhile it pictured 'natives' elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9.\"\n\nUnlike magazines such as Life, \"National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture,\" Goldberg says, noting that she is the first woman and first Jewish person to helm the magazine \u2013 \"two groups that also once faced discrimination here.\"\n\nTo assess the magazine's coverage historically, Mason delved into old issues and read a couple of key critical studies. He also pored over photographers' contact sheets, giving him a view of not just the photos that made it into print, but also the decisions that photographers and editors made.\n\nHe saw a number of problematic themes emerge.\n\n\"The photography, like the articles, didn't simply emphasize difference, but made difference ... very exotic, very strange, and put difference into a hierarchy,\" Mason tells NPR. \"And that hierarchy was very clear: that the West, and especially the English-speaking world, was at the top of the hierarchy. And black and brown people were somewhere underneath.\"\n\nFor much of its history, the pages of National Geographic depicted the Western world as dynamic, forward-moving and very rational. Meanwhile, Mason says, \"the black and brown world was primitive and backwards and generally unchanging.\"\n\nOne trope that he noticed time and again was photographs showing native people apparently fascinated by Westerners' technology.\n\n\"It's not simply that cameras and jeeps and airplanes are present,\" he says. \"It's the people of color looking at this technology in amusement or bewilderment.\" The implication was that Western readers would find humor in such fascination with their everyday goods.\n\nThen there's how the magazine chose its subject matter. Mason explains that National Geographic had an explicit editorial policy of \"nothing unpleasant,\" so readers rarely saw war, famine or civic conflict.\n\nHe points to an article on South Africa from the early 1960s that barely mentions the Sharpeville Massacre, in which 69 black South Africans were killed by police.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kip Ross/National Geographic Creative Kip Ross/National Geographic Creative\n\n\"There are no voices of black South Africans,\" Mason told Goldberg. \"That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances ... servants or workers. It's bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers, and photographers had to consciously not see.\"\n\nThen there's the way women of color were often depicted in the magazine: topless.\n\n\"Teenage boys could always rely, in the '50s and '60s, on National Geographic to show them bare-breasted women as long as the women had brown or black skin,\" Mason says. \"I think the editors understood this was frankly a selling point to its male readers. Some of the bare-breasted young women are shot in a way that almost resembles glamour shots.\"\n\nMason says the magazine has been dealing with its history implicitly for the last two or three decades, but what made this project different is that Goldberg wanted to make reckoning explicit \u2014 \"That National Geographic should not do an issue on race without understanding its own complicity in shaping understandings of race and racial hierarchy.\"\n\ntoggle caption Robert F. Sisson and Donald McBain/National Geographic\n\nFor those of us who have spent long afternoons thumbing old issues of the magazine and dreaming of far-off lands, Mason wants to make clear that looking at foreign people and places isn't a bad thing.\n\n\"We're all curious and we all want to see. I'm not criticizing the idea of being curious about the world. It's just the other messages that are sent\u2014that it's not just difference, but inferiority and superiority.\"\n\nSo where does the storied publication go from here?\n\nOne good step would be to invite the diverse contributors to the April issue to become part of the magazine's regular pool of writers and photographers, Mason suggests.\n\n\"Still it's too often a Westerner who is telling us about Africa or Asia or Latin America,\" he says. \"There are astonishing photographers from all over the world who have unique visions \u2013 not just of their own country, but who could bring a unique vision to photographing Cincinnati, Ohio, if it came to that.\"\n\nHe notes that the magazine's images have so often captivated, even when they were stereotypical or skewed. Mason says a number of African photographers have told him that it was magazines like National Geographic and Life that turned them onto photography in the first place.\n\n\"They knew that there were problems with the way that they and their people were being represented,\" he says. \"And yet the photography was often spectacularly good, it was really inviting, and it carried this power. And as young people, these men and women said, I want to do that.

Right Call?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption April Dembosky/KQED April Dembosky/KQED\n\nFour months after having her second baby, Jessica Porten started feeling really irritable. Little things would annoy her, like her glider chair.\n\n\"It had started to squeak,\" she says. \"And so when I'm sitting there rocking the baby and it's squeaking, I would just get so angry at that stupid chair.\"\n\nShe read online that irritability could be a symptom of postpartum depression \u2014 a condition that affects up to 1 in 7 women during or after pregnancy, according to the American Psychological Association. In California, where Porten lives, those rates are even higher, spurring state lawmakers to introduce a package of bills to improve mental health screening and treatment for new moms.\n\nPorten hopes they help women avoid what she went through.\n\nShe went to Capital OB/GYN, a women's clinic in Sacramento that accepts her Medicaid coverage as payment, to talk about medication options and therapy. Porten admitted to the nurse that she was having some violent thoughts.\n\n\"I described maybe hitting myself or squeezing the baby too tight,\" she says. \"But I was very adamant through the entire appointment that I was not going to hurt myself and I was not going to hurt my children.\"\n\nBut, Porten says, the nurse's manner toward her changed. \"I could see in that moment that she stopped listening to me,\" Porten says.\n\nThe nurse called the police. The police escorted Porten and her baby to the emergency room. Hospital staff made her change into a gown and took her purse, but they let her keep her diaper bag for the baby. They put them both in a room, under constant watch, though the hospital staff was sympathetic, Porten says.\n\n\"It's like, everybody knows I'm not crazy,\" she says. \"Everybody knows that this is normal \u2014 but they're following protocol.\"\n\nFinally, at midnight, 10 hours after she first got to the doctor's office, a social worker sent her home. Porten wrote on Facebook that the whole thing made her feel like a criminal.\n\n\"It was all legality,\" Porten says. \"Everybody was protecting their own liability instead of thinking of me.\"\n\nAdministrators at Capital OB/GYN declined to comment. Gary Zavoral, a spokesman for Sutter Health, which runs the emergency room where Porten was taken, says that once a patient arrives in the ER for assessment, hospital staff must follow strict protocols.\n\n\"The process is to make sure everybody is safe: the individual's safe, the family's safe, the staff is safe,\" he says. \"The process does take some hours, so 10 hours is not unusual.\"\n\nWhen patients reference violent thoughts, it forces doctors to think about things in a different way, says Dr. Melanie Thomas, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nCalifornia law allows doctors to involuntarily confine a person with a mental disorder if they are a danger to themselves or others. But Thomas says what constitutes imminent danger can be vague.\n\n\"You can imagine a provider, a social worker, any number of people might interpret that phrase in different ways, about what is necessary to report and what isn't,\" she says.\n\nThe laws and medical protocols don't always line up, Thomas says. There have been times she felt asked to rely on legal reasoning over her clinical judgment.\n\n\"The fragmented aspects of our system of care make it difficult to get women the help that they really want,\" Thomas says.\n\nThat is one reason lawmakers in Sacramento are now introducing a package of bills to specifically address maternal mental health. Assemblyman Brian Maienschein, R-San Diego, is backing two of them. One would require doctors to screen new moms for depression; under current law, it's voluntary.\n\n\"The numbers here are so significant that I think it's something that doctors really should understand and should be prepared to both diagnose and treat,\" he says. Screening, he adds, also \"educates a woman in that situation that this is an issue that may impact her.\"\n\nMaienschein's other bill would direct the state to tap into a new federal pot of money set aside for postpartum programs and awareness campaigns. It was established under the 21 Century Cures Act, which was passed in the final months of the Obama administration.\n\n\"Getting federal money is a great thing,\" Maienschein says. \"It's federal money that's available that I'd like to see California have, versus another state.\"\n\nThe legislation has given Jessica Porten a new purpose. People have told her that she should sue Capital OB/GYN for calling the police.

Luther Strange, R-Ala., at a campaign rally Friday night, when he used a segue in his speech that was supposed to convince voters that continuing to have Strange in the Senate would make all Alabamans winners \u2014 an argument with emotional appeal in a state known for its fierce love of football.\n\nCNN via YouTube\n\nAnd while he was on the subject of football, Trump took the opportunity to expound on his thoughts regarding NFL players, like Colin Kaepernick, who last year began kneeling during the national anthem in protest over perceived social injustices against African-Americans. Trump's take: It's unpatriotic and NFL team owners should fire those refusing to stand.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now'?\" he said to roaring applause.\n\n\"He's fired!\" Trump said, paraphrasing his popular reality TV catchphrase.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump took on Stephen Curry of the NBA champion Golden State Warriors in a tweet. The president rescinded an offer for what has become a traditional celebratory visit to the White House for any championship team of a major professional sport.\n\nHe wrote: \"Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\"\n\nThe president was reacting to Curry's statement Friday that the popular star player didn't want to visit the White House and meet with Trump because Curry believed that passing on the traditional event would send the message that \"we won't stand for\" some of Trump's past remarks. \"This is my opportunity to voice that,\" Curry also said, of the possibility of not going to the White House as expected.\n\nSaturday afternoon, Trump was back online attacking the NFL.\n\n\"If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nWhile none of Trump's tweets or remarks were explicitly about race, they led to an escalating war of words between the president and black athletes, activists and celebrities on social media. And the president, who was almost immediately cast as being divisive, took a serious pummeling from NFL team owners and notable black public figures.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Saturday morning, \"Divisive comments like these demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL, our great game and all of our players.\"\n\nLate Friday night, before Trump had sparked controversy involving Curry, Max Garcia of the Denver Broncos couldn't help comparing Trump's comments about kneeling in the NFL during the campaign rally with how he responded to events in Charlottesville, Va., last month that left one counterprotester dead.\n\n\"What an emphatic response, where was this passion in response to Charlottesville...\" Garcia wrote on Twitter with a video of Trump.\n\nIndividual NFL teams, including the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers all issued statements Saturday condemning Trump's remarks.\n\nJed York, CEO of the San Francisco 49ers, for whom Kaepernick played last year when he began the kneeling protest, issued this statement:\n\n\"The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for. Our players have exercised their rights as United States citizens in order to spark conversation and action to address social injustice.\"\n\nDolphins owner Stephen Ross said, \"Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more divisiveness. We need to seek to understand each other and have civil discourse instead of condemnation and sound bites.\"\n\nMeanwhile, current and former luminaries in the NBA weighed in online Saturday expressing support for Curry and criticizing Trump.\n\nBasketball megastar LeBron James, who has nearly as many followers on Twitter (38.4 million) as Trump does on his personal account (39 million), defended Curry, his sometimes rival on the court.\n\nJames wrote, \"U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\"\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, James' tweet has been liked more than a 1.1 million times and retweeted more than a half million times. According to Twitter, the message is James' most retweeted post to date.\n\nJames later recorded and posted a two-minute video to Twitter in which he said, \"It's not about dividing. We as American people need to come together even stronger.\"\n\nChris Paul, who plays for the Houston Rockets and is president of the NBA Players Association, questioned the president's attention to the issue in the first place. \"With everything that's going on in our country, why are YOU focused on who's kneeling and visiting the White House??? #StayInYoLane,\" Paul wrote on Twitter.\n\nRetired longtime Los Angeles Laker Kobe Bryant contributed this to the online conversation, suggesting Trump was not living up to his ubiquitous campaign slogan: \"A #POTUS whose name alone creates division and anger. Whose words inspire dissension and hatred can't possibly 'Make America Great Again.' \"\n\nBy Saturday afternoon, the Warriors formally announced they were not visiting the White House \u2014 or Trump. \"We accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited,\" the team said in a statement.\n\n\"In lieu of a visit to the White House,\" the NBA champions added, \"we have decided that we'll constructively use our trip to the nation's capital in February to celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion \u2014 the values we embrace as an organization.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ben Margot/AP Ben Margot/AP\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was \"disappointed\" the team would not be visiting the White House. Curry, for his part, suggested Trump's effort to target him was beneath the dignity of the presidency.\n\nThe dual controversies also elicited reaction Saturday from black celebrities including musician John Legend, actor Jesse Williams and filmmaker Ava DuVernay, among others.\n\nSome politicians also joined the fray on Twitter.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., took a jab at Trump for comments he has made in the past ridiculing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being of prisoner of war. \"And if a person wants the privilege of serving as President, they shouldn't be allowed to disrespect military heroes who were taken prisoner,\" Schiff tweeted.\n\nCalifornia's lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, congratulated the Warriors for the stance. \"Couldn't be more proud of the @warriors. Thank you for speaking truth to power and standing up for our fundamental California values,\" he wrote.\n\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the country's growing divisiveness, suggested that if the kneeling protest spread, NFL players would be playing into Trump's hands: \"btw, Trump wants you to kneel\u2014because it divides the nation, with him and the flag on the same side. Don't give him the attention he wants,\" Sasse tweeted.\n\nSeemingly answering Sasse, Trump backers argued that the president's comments have nothing to do with race and are purely about patriotism and respect for the flag.\n\n\"Has our world turned upside down! Our President criticized for believing our flag & anthem should be respected & honored #StandForTheFlag,\" Ronna Romney, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, wrote on Twitter.\n\nFormer Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski expressed similar sentiments on Fox News Saturday.\n\nSome in the Washington press corps wrote Saturday that the president is deliberately using coded language to appeal to his base of white voters who see themselves as part of an aggrieved group in America, rapidly losing power and influence relative to ethnic and racial minorities.\n\n\"To address a largely white crowd as 'people like yourselves,' and refer to protesting athletes, often African American, as 'those people,' does nothing to heal the wounds of Charlottesville,\" political journalist Mike Allen wrote on Axios.com Saturday morning.\n\nRon Brownstein, another seasoned political journalist in D.C., spent most of the day on Twitter putting forth the argument that exploiting racial and economic anxieties and divisions was one of Trump's key political strategies.\n\n\"Point of this fight is not very hard to find- more signaling to white racial resentment, which has been central to Trump message from day 1,\" Brownstein tweeted.\n\nBrownstein reaffirmed his point in a later tweet when another journalist questioned whether Trump was utilizing any strategy at all. \"Yes, pretty clearly from day 1: to appeal to parts of older, blue-collar, non-urban white America most uneasy about demographic & eco change,\" Brownstein wrote.\n\nAnother journalist was more blunt. \"There is an unmistakable racial element at play, since he is targeting prominent black players,\" CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote Saturday afternoon about Trump's NFL comments.\n\nAnd Stelter's CNN colleague Chris Cillizza saw something similar, writing Saturday that the context of Trump's criticisms was inherently racial given that both the NBA and NFL have mostly white team owners and mostly black players. Cillizza went on to point out that Trump's comments Friday and Saturday bore two rhetorical hallmarks that went back to his presidential campaign: using racially coded language and espousing a seemingly simplistic view of the black community.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout most of Saturday, the hashtag #TakeAKnee trended on Twitter across the U.S., as people sympathetic to Kaepernick wondered about what NFL players would do Sunday and as they talked about posting photos of themselves kneeling in solidarity.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Kaepernick-style protest spread to professional baseball.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Eric Risberg/AP\n\nCatcher Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland A's took a knee during the national anthem before a game Saturday night in California.

{"title": "FACT CHECK: 4 Claims From Trump's Tax Speech", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/08/30/547411439/fact-check-4-claims-from-trumps-tax-speech", "text": "FACT CHECK: 4 Claims From Trump's Tax Speech\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump pitched a tax overhaul package on Wednesday in a speech that was heavy on politicking and light on the particulars.\n\nTrump's tax policy ideas are still sketchy \u2014 when pitched in April, they amounted to one page of bullet points. In his Wednesday remarks, he didn't add much more detail beyond the broad strokes, saying he wants lower rates for the middle class, a simpler tax code, lower corporate rates and for companies to \"bring back [their] money\" from overseas to the U.S.\n\nIn his speech in Springfield, Mo., though, he said a few things that were misleading or could use more context. Here are four fact checks:\n\n1. Economic growth rate\n\n\"We just announced that we hit 3 percent in GDP. Just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration during an eight-year period never hit 3 percent. So we're really on our way.\"\n\nHe's right that on Wednesday, the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew at a 3 percent rate in the second quarter. This was an upward revision from a previously announced 2.6 percent (and will still be revised again).\n\nBut he is making it sound as if growth during his administration is already appreciably faster than it was during the Obama administration. That's not true. Quarterly GDP growth during the Obama presidency did hit 3 percent several times.\n\nThere's a technicality here, though: Trump used the phrase \"on a yearly basis.\" If he's talking about calendar years, he's right, but barely. According to Commerce Department data, annual GDP growth during Obama's presidency hit a high of 2.9 percent in 2015 \u2014 so, just shy of 3 percent. But then, if he is measuring any given 12-month period, he's not right; year-over-year GDP growth was at times over 3 percent during the Obama presidency.\n\nEither way, that 3 percent rate he pulled out is how annual growth would look if growth from the second quarter were to hold for a full year. Reporting the GDP rate in this annual way makes it easier to show whether growth was faster in, say, this quarter than it was in prior years. But once again, it still has that hypothetical aspect to it.\n\nAnd that leads to a more important point here: Many economists believe that sustained 3 percent growth, like Trump says he can help create, is unlikely. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget earlier this year tried to game out how that kind of GDP growth could happen. Its outlook was not rosy.\n\n\"By our estimates, returning capital growth, productivity growth, and prime-age labor force participation to where they were in the 1990s would result in 2.9-percent growth,\" they wrote. And getting to those levels, they added, would be \"an unlikely scenario given recent trends.\"\n\nIn other words, while Trump is celebrating this one quarter of growth, seeing it quarter after quarter after quarter would be a surprise.\n\n2. Comparing U.S. growth with other countries'\n\n\"You look at other countries and you look at what their GDP is, they're unhappy when it's 7, 8, 9. And I speak to them, leaders of the countries \u2014 'How are you doing?' 'Not well. Not well.' 'Why?' 'GDP is down to 7 percent.' And I'm saying, 'We were hitting 1 percent just a number of months ago.' \"\n\nWe can't fact-check Trump here in the strictest sense (that is, we don't really know what these other leaders are telling him), but we can check the assumption that we can compare the U.S.'s growth rate with other countries'. The answer: It doesn't work like that.\n\n\"The countries that are growing at 7 percent are emerging market economies like China or India or other emerging market economies,\" said Nick Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nHe explained that these countries have what some economists call a \"latecomer advantage\" \u2014 an additional lift that comes from starting out behind other countries. For example, he pointed to China, which has grown quickly in part because of foreign firms coming in and setting up shop there. So when Volkswagen sets up a plant in China, it's bringing in processes and technologies from the outside.\n\n\"They can do joint ventures or have foreign firms come in, they can license technology, they can improve labor productivity,\" he explained.\n\nThis is what helps a country like China or India have an economic growth rate of around 7 percent.\n\n3. A \"simple\" tax code\n\n\"We need a tax code that is simple, fair and easy to understand. And that means getting rid of loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests. Our last major tax rewrite was 31 years ago. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest tax rates, reduced the number of tax brackets from 15 to two, and lowered tax rates for individuals and businesses. Since then, tax laws have tripled in size.\"\n\nThe Reagan tax plan, approved by Congress in 1986, did cut back on loopholes, and it did cut the number of brackets down to two.\n\nBut there's one important point buried in here, and it's that bit about the number of tax brackets and setting rates. Trump said he wants to make the tax code \"simple, fair, and easy to understand.\" Brackets and rates are not what make the tax code byzantine (\"fair\" is subjective, and we're staying out of that here).\n\n\"It's a very mild form of simplification,\" said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank, in an interview with NPR in 2015. \"The real complication in the system is in the tax base, not in the rate structure. Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether you're eligible for the [earned income tax credit for lower-income Americans], given the child rules \u2014 once you've got that, then you just plug in the rates.\"\n\nThe brackets-simplicity argument is one Americans are bound to hear more as Congress debates a tax code overhaul; politicians try to draw this connection often. But slicing down deductions \u2014 and potentially upsetting some groups of voters \u2014 could be a tougher sell.\n\n4. The corporate tax rate\n\n\"Today we are still taxing our businesses at 35 percent. And it's way more than that. And think of it \u2014 in some cases way above 40 percent when you include state and local taxes in various states. The United States is now behind France, behind Germany, behind Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and many other nations also.\"\n\nThe top federal corporate tax rate is indeed 35 percent, and in some states, corporate tax rates can push that rate higher. In Iowa, the top corporate rate is 12 percent, and in five other states plus the District of Columbia, the rate is 9 percent or higher, according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation. (One could quibble with \"way higher,\" then, but in general, Trump is right on this.)\n\nThat's what puts the U.S. \"behind\" other countries, in Trump's estimation. Except what matters is the effective tax rate. Deductions and credits help bring U.S. companies' tax rates below what they would otherwise pay. The effective tax rate for U.S. corporations is only around 18.6 percent, which is on the high end compared with other advanced economies but not unusually high \u2014 it's a few percentage points below Japan, a few above Germany, and right in line with the U.K.\n\nAnd those tax rates vary widely from firm to firm: A recent report found that out of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies, 39 percent paid zero corporate taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015.", "keywords": ["rates", "way", "countries", "check", "tax", "trumps", "rate", "quarter", "trump", "growth", "speech", "corporate", "claims", "gdp", "fact"], "polarity": 0.06621248499399764, "subjectivity": 0.40658563425370153},

Meanwhile, all around the United States, state legislators, treatment providers, families and many others will be listening.\n\nThe administration's other opioid efforts have, so far, yielded no new money. Congress authorized funds in its recent budget deal \u2014 but those dollars aren't flowing yet, and states say they are struggling.\n\nThe Oklahoma agency in charge of substance abuse has been told by the state's legislature to cut more than $2 million from this fiscal year's budget. And that has the providers of opioid addiction treatment on edge.\n\n\"Treatment dollars are scarce,\" says Randy Tate, president of the Oklahoma Behavioral Health Association, which represents addiction treatment providers.\n\nIt's like dominoes, Tate says. When you cut funding for treatment, other safety net programs feel the strain.\n\n\"Any cuts to our overall contract,\" he says, \"really diminish our ability to provide the case management necessary to advocate for homes, food, shelter, clothing, primary health care and all the other things that someone needs to really be successful at tackling their addiction.\"\n\nIn just three years, Oklahoma's agency in charge of funding opioid treatment has seen more than $27 million dollars chipped away from its budget \u2014 thanks to legislative gridlock, slashed state taxes and a drop in oil prices (with the additional loss in state tax revenue that resulted).\n\nJeff Dismukes, a spokesman for Oklahoma's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, says the already lean agency has few cost-cutting options left.\n\n\"We always cut first to administration,\" he says, \"but there's a point where you just can't cut anymore.\"\n\nThe agency may end up putting off payments to treatment providers until July \u2014 the next fiscal year. Tate says that could be devastating.\n\n\"Very thinly financed, small rural providers are probably at risk of going out of business entirely \u2014 up to and including rural hospitals,\" he says.\n\nGetting treatment providers to open up shop in rural areas is really hard, even in good times, and more financial uncertainty could make that problem worse. In the meantime, according to an Oklahoma state commission's opioid report, just 10 percent of Oklahomans who need addiction treatment are getting it.\n\nThat statistic is similar in Colorado. And as 2018 began, Colorado's escalating opioid crisis got worse, when the state's largest drug and alcohol treatment provider, Arapahoe House, shut its doors.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Daley/CPR News John Daley/CPR News\n\nThe facility provided recovery treatment to 5,000 people a year. Denise Vincioni, who directs another treatment center, the Denver Recovery Group, says other facilities have scrambled to pick up the patients.\n\nMost of Arapahoe's clients were on Medicaid. Autumn Haggard-Wolfe, a two-time Arapahoe House client who is now in recovery, worries the facility's closing will have dire consequences, especially for people who need inpatient care, as she did.\n\n\"I feel like the only other option right now in therapy would be jail for people,\" she says, \"and people die in there from withdrawing.\"\n\nArapahoe House's CEO blamed its closure on the high cost of care and poor government reimbursement for services.\n\nThe mother of Colorado state lawmaker Brittany Pettersen struggled with addiction, and was treated at Arapahoe House. Pettersen says treatment centers rely on a crazy quilt of funding sources and are chronically underfunded \u2014 often leaving people with no treatment options.\n\n\"We have a huge gap in Colorado,\" Pettersen says, \"and that was before Arapahoe House closed.\"\n\nShe is pushing legislation in the state to increase funding for treatment. But to get tens of millions of dollars in federal matching funds, Colorado lawmakers need to approve at least $34 million a year in new state spending.\n\nThat price tag may simply be too high for some lawmakers. But either way, she adds, \"It's going to take a lot to climb out of where we are.\"\n\nColorado did get new federal funds to fight the opioid crisis through the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in December of 2016, but it was just $7.8 million a year for two years \u2014 divvied up among a long list of programs.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with StateImpact Oklahoma, Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["seek", "colorado", "oklahoma", "funding", "state", "providers", "states", "treatment", "opioid", "million", "federal", "promises", "house"], "polarity": 0.018726551226551213, "subjectivity": 0.4196360028860028},

In film, television, comic books and memoir, there has been an ascendant generation of Muslim artists claiming their space in the representation conversation. For the second and third-generation of hyphenated artists making this work, it's an unapologetic reclamation of their narrative from terrorist headlines. One of the more rich and surprising developments in this wave is the emergence of Muslim-American theater.\n\nThe medium rewards combustible characters that clash and chafe against others on stage, igniting the dramatic sparks that win accolades. It's a fitting form for the precarious Muslim-American condition since 9/11, giving a new generation of playwrights the landscape of terrorism, profiling and suspicion to craft their high-octane drama.\n\n\"I think theater at its best gives ideas flesh and blood,\" Ayad Akhtar told me in a conversation for NPR. He's one of the most celebrated of these new voices, winning a Pulitzer Prize in 2013 for his debut play about a self-hating Muslim-American called Disgraced. \"It can animate dialectic between points of view. It's not mediated by screens and it has an ear to the ground,\" he says.\n\nOther rising Muslim-American playwrights include Wajahat Ali, who premiered The Domestic Crusaders on the eighth anniversary of 9/11 at New York City's Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9, and Hammaad Chaudry, whose play, An Ordinary Muslim, has just opened at the New York Theatre Workshop.\n\nIf there's one thread these new works share, it's their effort to counter flattened ideas of the 'Muslim' by presenting individual lives in all their complicated iterations. By inviting audiences into the homes, private spaces and inner demons of Western Muslims, they're advancing representation on stage and adding to the canon of hyphenated American theater.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Suzi Sadler/MRPR Press Suzi Sadler/MRPR Press\n\nAn Ordinary Muslim began as Chaudry's graduate thesis, and then evolved into a sprawling production under the guidance of the acclaimed American playwright Tony Kushner. The new piece wrestles with what it means to be an assimilated, \"ordinary\" Muslim. As Chaudry tells me, \" ... the larger question of the title is that there is no such thing as an ordinary Muslim. You are seeing seven different Muslims who embody different kinds of Islam.\"\n\nChaudry's play was inspired by his childhood in Scotland and his formative educational and professional years in London and New York. The piece centers on a second-generation British Muslim man named Azeem Bhatti. To his co-workers, Azeem is an integrated 'ordinary' Muslim who occasionally joins for rounds at the pub. But in private, he's struggling with how much of his faith to embrace as Britain's Islamophobia weighs on his career and his family life.\n\nHis father's history of physical abuse against his mother resurfaces as the play opens. At the same time, Azeem's own wife has decided to wear the hijab against his wishes. In the backdrop, a young preacher at the neighborhood mosque is recruiting new congregants and confronts Azeem to be a more 'visible' and less 'insecure' Muslim. As Azeem's character unravels amid these pressures \u2013 both private and public \u2013 he lashes out at one of his white co-workers. \"I don't want to be tolerated, I want to be respected,\" he screams. It's a resonant and powerful line that encapsulates the struggle for dignity facing Western Muslims.\n\nDespite its timely message, the play was conceived long before the campaign and election of President Trump brought the question of 'Muslim identity' and 'migration' to its boiling point. Hammaad Chaudry tells me the play is less about the current climate than it is about the more insidious Islamophobia reflected across popular culture since 9/11.\n\nChaudry adds that such a large ensemble production is also his way of creating roles for fellow artists of color: \"Representation is very important to me. In theater, you're dealing with a very small pool. Having said that, we've really made a commitment to have South Asian actors, but also actors that could be right for the role. It took three years and that gives you insight about the challenges you face.\"\n\nThe market reality of the mainstream New York stage imposes its own kind of limitations. At the performance of An Ordinary Muslim that I attended, the audience was older, affluent and mostly white. Each audience member was handed a reference guide to some of the unfamiliar 'Islamic' terms. At the conclusion of the play, a mediator came to the front of the theater and invited the audience to stay for a conversation about the themes of the piece \u2013 a safe space to broadcast our reservations and observations.\n\nI stayed behind with some of the older couples and one man immediately raised his voice. \"When Azeem has everything, why is he so unhappy and so ungrateful?\" he complained. The revelation that a seemingly assimilated British Muslim could harbor such confusion had left several of the viewers equally confused. The mediator nodded and added that while she couldn't answer for the playwright or the cast, we should all consider the critique.\n\nAs I left the well-intentioned Q&A, I thought about the inherently didactic responsibly thrust upon the play in this political climate. Across the curatorial and critical coverage of works like Chaudry's, there is an earnest frame placed around art by and about Muslims.\n\nIt seems to suggest that \"these works are good for you\" in the way that hearty greens can be in an age of fast food. For artists like Chaudry, that framing poses its own restrictions by foregrounding their political value over their creative achievements or limitations.\n\nAn Ordinary Muslim is an elegant and intelligent contribution to an emerging body of art about the fraught Western Muslim condition.\n\nUnfortunately, the same political forces and market opportunities that have propelled the piece to the stage may have muddled its message. The play is far too long and its characters' varying conflicts do not reach their own conclusions.\n\nAs The New York Times' theatre critic Jesse Green said, a tighter focus and a less ambitious effort to include all manner of private and public pressures could serve to sharpen the writer's thesis.\n\nThe play argues that while Muslims are misunderstood, they also deserve the space to better understand and become themselves.

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\n\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\". Those six words form the title of a song from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's South Pacific, the wildly popular musical revolving around cross-cultural love affairs in the South Pacific during World War II.\n\nThat phrase \u2014 \"You've got to be carefully taught\" \u2014 is also a popular entry in The Race Card Project's inbox. More than a dozen people have offered submissions quoting those six words in some way.\n\nLet's begin with a little context. The musical South Pacific, which opened on Broadway in 1949, won several Tony Awards the following year. Then, years later, it became a hit movie.\n\nTo say South Pacific was successful would be an understatement \u2014 it was a blockbuster. But it also drew critics and controversy. It covered uncomfortable territory. Its romantic tension was based on interracial romance, a strong taboo at the time.\n\nEven so, the soundtrack topped the charts. Songs like \"Some Enchanted Evening\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\" were in heavy rotation on the radio and on record players around the country.\n\nAnd judging from the inbox at The Race Card Project, the message behind the song \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" has resonated with those who love the South Pacific soundtrack, like Kathleen Ziegler of Lino Lakes, Minn. She says she first heard that song on her family's record player.\n\n\"I had three older sisters,\" she says. \"We used to put the records on a lot, as we were cleaning, especially. And we'd have it turned way up and we learned all the songs.\"\n\nThe sisters would sing together, Ziegler says, and the lyrics to \"You've Got to Be Taught\" stay with her, even today.\n\nYou've got to be taught\n\nTo hate and fear, you've got to be taught from year to year\n\nIt's got to be drummed in your dear little ear\n\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\nYou've got to be taught\n\nTo be afraid of people\n\nWhose eyes are oddly made\n\nAnd people whose skin is a different shade\n\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\n\"I just remember hearing [the lyrics] when I was young, and it made me very sad,\" Ziegler says. \"I had parents who did exceptionally love us and taught us to do the same. And I just thought, how can people be taught to hate, especially children?\"\n\nZiegler was raised by parents of German descent during World War II. She remembers that the patriotism of that time was also steeped in bias.\n\n\"One of my earliest memories is knowing that you were supposed to hate 'Japs.' We used to say, 'Bombs over Tokyo,' and drop something on the ground,\" she says. \"I never thought of it as being a hateful thing \u2014 then.\"\n\nBut those are words she would never say today, Ziegler says. \"No, no. That's offensive. [But] that was what we were taught. Or, what we heard.\"\n\nSeveral people have referenced \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" in their six-word submissions to The Race Card Project. Follow the links below to learn more about why, decades after its release, the song still resonates with each of them. Claire Rosenbaum, Cumberland, R.I. Katherine Roskam, Charlotte, N.C. Leigh Slater, Hagerstown, Md. You can't be friends with her \u2013 Rosie W., Tucson, Ariz.\n\nLove Stories With A Cultural Twist\n\nWhat people hear and see in South Pacific are classic love stories with a thorny cultural twist. What happens, for instance, when \"boy meets girl\" becomes \"all-American boy meets Asian girl in wartime setting\"?\n\nPerhaps Oscar Hammerstein was challenging the democratic principles at stake in World War II. In 1958, Hammerstein was on The Mike Wallace Interview, hosted by Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes fame. \"South Pacific had two love stories in it,\" Hammerstein told Wallace. \"They both concern, in a different way, race prejudice.\"\n\nIn the interview, Hammerstein explained that one of the love stories involves a plucky American woman named Nellie Forbush.\n\n\"Nellie Forbush, the Navy nurse, is in love with a Frenchman, and when she finds out that he was once married to a Polynesian woman and has two Polynesian \u2014 no, half-Polynesian \u2014 children, she runs away,\" he explained.\n\n\"She's shocked by it, and she's awakened later when she fears he's dead, and then suddenly she realizes how unimportant was her prejudice, how important it was that she loved him and how much she wants him back, no matter what kind of children he has,\" he said.\n\n\"What we were saying was that ... all this prejudice that we have is something that fades away in the face of something that's really important,\" Hammerstein told Wallace.\n\nSo, love wins ... sometimes. Because the other love story, Hammerstein explained, \"is about a young Marine who falls in love with a Tonkinese girl on the island.\"\n\nWell \u2014 spoiler alert: Despite the burning desire between Lt. Cable and the island girl, named Liat, their differences keep them apart.\n\nA Deliberate Message?\n\nAt the time of South Pacific's release, its theme of racial and romantic tolerance was just too much for some. Some members of the military complained that \"Carefully Taught\" ruined the flow of the musical.\n\nWhen the show went on national tour in the 1950s, two Georgia state lawmakers were repulsed after seeing it, and said a song justifying marriage between races was offensive. One of them, Rep. David C. Jones, wrote in a letter, \"We in the South are a proud and progressive people. Half-breeds cannot be proud.\"\n\nScholars suspect that Hammerstein knew he would strike a nerve with South Pacific. He had tucked liberal messages into previous productions.\n\nLarry Maslon, a Broadway historian who teaches at the graduate acting program at New York University, says he has always thought of Oscar Hammerstein as a preacher, \"In the way that I think of Abraham Lincoln as a preacher, or Leonard Bernstein as a preacher. Lincoln used the White House, Bernstein used the conductor's podium, and Oscar used the theater,\" he says.\n\n\"And all of his shows offer a kind of benign choice, it seems to me: that tolerance is probably better than prejudice; that enlightenment is probably better than ignorance,\" he says. \"And I think he appealed, in the way that Lincoln did, actually, in his second inaugural address, to the better angels of our nature.\"\n\nNearly 70 years ago, Hammerstein's message of tolerance was largely about race and romance. But on so many levels \u2014 race, sexual orientation, class, religion, gender \u2014 the challenge of reaching across differences is still relevant today.", "keywords": ["words", "love", "used", "youve", "pacific", "intolerance", "carefully", "hammerstein", "taught", "race", "south"], "polarity": 0.11669696969696969, "subjectivity": 0.5028549783549786},

But the remarkable life of Floyd J. Carter ended this weekend, at age 95.\n\nCarter was one of the last of the Tuskegee Airmen, the famous unit whose members overcame both internal challenges and enemy fire as part of the Army Air Corps. For decades after that conflict, Carter flew numerous transport missions in other war zones, including Vietnam.\n\n\"We mourn the loss of a true American Hero,\" the NYPD's 47th Precinct said in a tweet on Sunday. After summarizing his decorated career, the precinct added, \"Our Community & Nation has lost a giant.\"\n\nAfter he became a police officer in 1953, Carter quickly rose to the rank of detective; he retired from the NYPD in 1980. The flag outside the precinct house in the Bronx was flown at half-staff in Carter's honor.\n\nThe New York Daily News reports:\n\n\"His NYPD duties included work as a bodyguard for visiting heads of state, and Carter spent time with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Soviet head Nikita Khrushchev, recalled his son Floyd Jr. \"He earned a half-dozen citations for his outstanding police work, and survived a number of shootouts with armed bandits.\"\n\nCarter retired from the U.S. Air Force Reserves in the early 1970s as a lieutenant colonel, having served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. In the final years of his more than 30-year career, he made history again as \"the first African American commander of a heavy jet transport squadron,\" as Flying magazine reported in 2009.\n\nIn an interview for that article in Flying, Carter spoke about the discrimination he and his fellow cadets faced during their training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama. The conditions were a main reason cadets exited the program. Carter said he only reacted once \u2014 by buzzing Alabama's Capitol building during a speech by the governor, whom he called \"extremely racist.\"\n\nFrom Flying, in 2009:\n\n\"So I took that B-25 to Montgomery ... it was only about 30 miles away,' Carter said. A broad, impish grin spread across the elderly man's face as he recalled the incident, all these years later. 'It was night, so I knew nobody would see my numbers. And I took that B-25 down low, and I turned up the power, and then I turned up the props.' He paused. 'And you know,' he said, 'when you turn up the props on a B-25, it really makes some noise!' He chuckled, remembering. 'And then I flew right over the top of that building, just to disturb his speech.' \"\n\nCarter is survived by Artherine, his wife of many years, along with their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nFloyd and Artherine Carter met while he was training to be a pilot at the Tuskegee Institute, and she was part of an all-female crew that repaired planes, as The New York Times reported in 2009.", "keywords": ["york", "dies", "floyd", "j", "airman", "career", "detective", "carter", "war", "tuskegee", "nypd", "flying", "precinct", "95"], "polarity": 0.11421040764790766, "subjectivity": 0.45460182178932185},

Compared to those presidential years, midterm meetings like Monday's are lesser-followed but they can point to momentum.\n\nLast night Republicans and Democrats discussed resolutions to their party's platforms and selected delegates for state conventions. They also addressed some issues.\n\nDrake University political scientist Rachel Paine Caufield flags labor rights as something on Democrats' minds.

Even in 2017, that's unusual.\n\nAs the city's weed industry grows, the players who are most likely to jump in on the \"green rush\" have two things in common: They are overwhelmingly white, and have access to lots of money.\n\nSo together, Senter, Unsworth, Parks and Lencho decided to change that.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Supernova Women Courtesy of Supernova Women\n\nIn 2015, they started an organization called Supernova Women, which offers free educational seminars to locals who are interested in the weed business. They talk about how they managed to break into the industry, as well as some of the pitfalls.\n\nAnd, in the spirit of consciousness-raising, they've created a safe space where prospective entrepreneurs can talk about what it feels like to be the only person of color in a mostly white space.\n\n\"Supernovas are a quiet force in the universe,\" Senter says. \"Things gravitate towards supernovas, and we saw all of us coming together as just being this huge force that could not be ignored. Because the issues that we were facing could not be ignored.\"\n\nFor our podcast episode this week, we spoke with Amber Senter and Andrea Unsworth about Supernova Women and about the challenges they've faced in an industry run predominantly by white people. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are the barriers of entry for people of color trying to operate a successful weed business?\n\n\n\nSenter: Our skin color, obviously, because people don't have to give us anything because of that. I mean, not only am I black, but I'm also a woman. Two levels of barriers there. Convincing someone to give you $250,000 so you can start a business, that's challenging in itself. Even with all the experience that might be bringing to the table, you're still going to get doubted.\n\nWhereas if I were a white man, coming up with some corny idea \u2014 people are just throwing money at them. You know? And then there's other people who have proven product, made a million dollars in sales on their own, and are having problems raising $100,000, because they're people of color, women of color in the industry. We deal with the same barriers that would exist in any industry, and then it's compounded because we're talking about a federally illegal substance.\n\nYou say it can be really hard, as a manufacturer, to go into a dispensary and talk to the buyer, because the buyer is a often a white guy. Can you break down that dynamic?\n\nSenter: First of all, when you're walking up to the dispensary, the people of color that are working in the dispensary are either going to be the security crew or the bud tenders, but none of the management. No one that's making any decisions. But that's how the whole industry currently is. Me, as a manufacturer looking for investment \u2014 there's no people of color investors. I mean they're out there, but they're hard to find.\n\nUnsworth: At the end of the day, we've been locking up people of color for 30 years, who have been selling cannabis. Now that it's legal, they say, \"Great, it's legal, but you have to have a million dollars to start.\"\n\nWell, how can you have a million dollars if, for the past 30 years, you and all your relatives have been getting locked up and trying to spend that money on bail money? And raising your family without a father, without an uncle, without a son? Those are the realities.\n\nThis whole thing of starting on a level playing field is ridiculous. [Nearly] 80 percent of the lock-ups are people of color. You're locking up all of these people who are trying to be entrepreneurs, but now that it's legal, you're allowed to say, \"Oh, you can come into our industry, but you can't have a criminal record. You can have a million dollars, but it can't be from cannabis, it has to be from your 401(k), or investments, or from your daddy.\"\n\nI mean, who are these people? These are not people of color.\n\nOn the site for Supernova Women, it says you want to foster a space for hard conversations. What type of hard conversations are y'all having?\n\nSenter: I'm a manufacturer. We make cannabis products that we turn around and sell to dispensaries. And often times going into the dispensary, I have to deal with people that do not look like me. Typically white males. And I've got to convince them to first hear me out, and then try my product and then, if they think the product is good enough, to get it on their shelves.\n\nWith the cultural differences and everything, these things are a fine dance, and a lot of people feel uncomfortable when you bring up these kinds of situations and things that we deal with. And I'm saying a lot of people \u2014 it's white folks. You know, they don't want to hear these things. So we create a safe space where we can discuss these issues and real-life things that we deal with daily.\n\nUnsworth: And I would say that those are the type of conversations that prompted things like the Oakland Equity Program, because that was not even on the table when we were first talking about cannabis.\n\nAt least we need to recognize that there has been an unfair \u2014 an unjust war \u2014 on people of color that has had an impact over the past 20 to 30 years, that has kept them out of the cannabis industry that is now burgeoning. And so if we're going to have folks coming into the cannabis industry, we have to at least acknowledge that there has been demonstrable damage done to a lot of these communities that would love to be entrepreneurs that should have been some of the first in line.\n\nBecause they've had innovative products and they've had the network, and they've had the skill to distribute cannabis for years, but were maybe locked up or put behind bars or just, you know, didn't have enough.", "keywords": ["black", "white", "theyve", "industry", "weed", "things", "color", "selling", "supernova", "women", "cannabis", "youre", "legally"], "polarity": 0.05500380517503807, "subjectivity": 0.4687404870624048},
{"title": "FACT CHECK: 10 Statements From Trump's Phoenix Speech", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/08/23/545504933/fact-check-10-statements-from-trumps-phoenix-speech", "text": "FACT CHECK: 10 Statements From Trump's Phoenix Speech\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt a campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, President Trump made news by slamming Republican senators, praising controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and blasting the news media.\n\nHe also defended his initial, controversial remarks on recent violent protests in Charlottesville, Va. But in doing so, he left out the parts of the remarks that inflamed people's tempers the most, like his comment that there was violence \"on many sides.\"\n\nThat's just one of the misleading or untruthful things Trump said. We fact-checked 10 of his statements.\n\n1. Anti-Trump protesters\n\n\"And just so you know from the Secret Service, there aren't too many people outside protesting, OK? That I can tell you.\"\n\nIt's impossible to fact-check exactly what Trump knew about protesters \u2014 if Secret Service agents spoke to Trump about protesters or what agents told him, for example.\n\nBut we do have at least some context on this claim: Trump very likely did see some protesters on his way to the convention center where his rally was held. In a pool report, Washington Times reporter David Boyer wrote about the anti-Trump activists along the route as the presidential motorcade drove to the rally site:\n\n\"We saw a smattering of supporters holding Trump/Pence signs and waving in the neighborhood near the hotel. As we got closer to the convention center, we saw more and more protesters. Hard to judge how many, but there were several hundred that we passed. \"Several people made obscene gestures at the motorcade. Some signs included 'Fire Trump' and 'Sad!' Also, 'Love One Another.' \"\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Trump didn't get the full scope of how many protesters were there, according to NPR's Geoff Bennett, who was traveling with the president as well. The motorcade didn't drive by the area where the overwhelming majority of protesters were gathered, Bennett reports. Those protesters numbered in the \"thousands,\" as Fox News and the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n2. Charlottesville statement\n\n\"I am really doing this to show you how dishonest these people are. Here is my first statement when I heard about Charlottesville. ... Here is what I said on Saturday:\n\n\" 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Va.' This is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event.\"\n\nThe key part here is this sentence: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence.\"\n\nTrump did say that, but he left out the second part of that sentence. The full sentence was: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2014 on many sides\" (per a transcript from Vox).\n\nIt was that \"many sides\" part that angered many people \u2014 it appeared to put the KKK, neo-Nazi and other white supremacist rallygoers on the same moral footing as the counterprotesters who opposed them.\n\nHe made the comparison more than once in his responses to the events in Charlottesville. The Tuesday after the protest, he said:\n\n\"OK, what about the alt-left that came charging \u2014 excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\" he said in response to a reporter's question. He later added, \"You had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides.\"\n\n3. CNN ratings\n\n\"CNN, which is so sad, so pathetic, and their ratings are going down.\"\n\nEarly in August, CNN released new data showing that its ratings are healthy. According to the report:\n\n\"Year to date, 2017 is pacing to be CNN's highest on record in Total Day among total viewers and highest among 25-54 since 2003. 2017 is also pacing to be CNN's second largest audience since 2008 in primetime among 25-54 and total viewers.\"\n\nIn addition, Variety reported in June that CNN had its \"most-watched first quarter in 14 years.\"\n\nOf course, CNN isn't alone in getting these ratings boosts; all three major cable news networks \"saw double-digit ratings growth across the board for the second quarter of 2017,\" Variety also reported.\n\nTrump has made the claim before as part of his ongoing attacks on the media. He said CNN's ratings were down in July, too; PolitiFact likewise at the time found this to be \"flat wrong.\"\n\n4. \"Racism was evil\"\n\n\"I said racism was evil. Did they report that I said racism was evil? No.\"\n\nMultiple headlines from an array of news outlets reported that Trump called racism \"evil\" in his Aug. 14 address \u2014 in which he also called out the KKK and neo-Nazis specifically after political pressure to do so.\n\n5. New York Times \"apology\"\n\n\"The New York Times essentially apologized after I won the election because their coverage was so bad, and it was so wrong, and they were losing so many subscribers that they practically apologized. I would say they did. They say, 'Well it wasn't really that much of an apology because they were losing so many people because they were misled.' \"\n\nTrump has claimed multiple times that the Times \"apologized,\" though this time he seemed to back off slightly by saying it \"essentially\" apologized. Either way, the New York Times did not apologize, as NPR's Jessica Taylor wrote in a fact-check of a Jan. 29 Trump tweet.\n\n\"New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet did write a letter to readers after the surprising election conclusion examining the paper's coverage. In the note, they acknowledged that 'after such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?' And a column from the paper's public editor (or ombudsman), Liz Spayd, pointed out problems with its data/forecasting vertical that predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning the election. She also argued that the paper's reporters could have done a better job of tapping into 'the sentiments of Trump supporters.' \"However, neither of those pieces constitutes an apology.\"\n\nThe Times itself in a March 29 tweet responded to Trump: \"False, we did not apologize. We stand by our coverage & thank our millions of subscribers for supporting our journalism.\"\n\n6. Health insurance premiums\n\n\"Arizona is a disaster in terms of your price increase ... 116 percent.\"\n\nThis figure is correct. It comes from an October 2016 report from the Department of Health and Human Services. It found that among all states, Arizona would have the largest average premium hike in 2017, as measured by silver plans offered to 27-year-olds.\n\nBut when talking about Affordable Care Act premium increases, it's misleading to not also mention tax credits.\n\n\"The caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the Affordable Care Act,\" as Will Stone, from NPR station KJZZ in Tempe, told NPR in March.\n\nStone added that GOP efforts to overhaul health care would very likely have made the situation in Arizona worse.\n\n\"The Republican replacement ... would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like Arizona.\"\n\n7. Job numbers\n\n\"Since I took the oath of office, we have added far more than 1 million jobs in the private sector. Unemployment is right now at almost a 17-year low.\"\n\nFrom February through July, U.S. firms have added 1,074,000 jobs, according to numbers from the Labor Department (with the caveat that those numbers are still subject to revision). That's solid growth, but it's not out of the norm for the last few years.\n\nAnd unemployment is 4.3 percent. The last time it was that low was May 2001, and the last time it was lower than that was February 2001 \u2014 so it has been 16 1/2 years since unemployment was lower than it is now.\n\n8. Economic growth\n\n\"Economic growth has surged to 2.6 percent. Remember, everybody said you will not bring it up to 1 percent.\"\n\nEconomic growth in the second quarter was indeed 2.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter. One can quibble with the word \"surged\" here, but 2.6 percent isn't at all an unusually high economic growth number. Economic growth is often around or above that level.\n\nBut as far as \"everybody\" saying that Trump wouldn't be able to boost economic growth above 1 percent, that's false. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee in its December meeting, for example, projected 2.1 percent economic growth for 2017. Economic advisory firm IHS likewise projected that in 2017, growth would be above 2 percent \u2014 2.3 percent, to be exact.\n\nTrump himself has said he's aiming for even higher growth: 3 percent, to be exact (and that's down from a 4 percent prediction he had made before). Even sustained 3 percent growth is unlikely to happen, according to many economists.\n\n9. Increasing wages\n\n\"Wages are rising.\"\n\nWages are indeed rising, but not very quickly \u2014 in fact, considering the low unemployment rate, economists continue to wonder why they aren't rising faster.\n\n\"The mystery continues to be with the labour market this tight, and the level of improvement we continue to see, that wages stubbornly stay at 2% year-over-year wage growth. To me that continues to be the mystery of the jobs report,\" as Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told the BBC after the July jobs report was released.\n\nIn the last jobs report, wage growth accelerated slightly, to 2.5 percent annually, as Bloomberg reported. That's a positive development, but wage growth can bounce around from month to month; if the upward movement becomes sustained, that will be a more promising sign. As CNN reported after the last jobs report, many economists would consider wage growth around 3 to 3.5 percent to be a better sign that the job market is healthy.\n\n10. Stock market highs\n\n\"The stock market is at its all-time high in history.\"\n\nTrump is right: The Dow Jones industrial average \u2014 one of the most closely watched stock indexes \u2014 has posted several record highs this year, passing the 22,000 mark in early August. The S&P 500, another popular index, has likewise hit multiple highs this year.\n\nAll stock index records come with the caveat that they are not adjusted for inflation. In addition, Trump can't really claim credit for that entire rally, as NPR's Jim Zarroli reported in July. While his policy agenda of deregulation and lower corporate taxes may have some in the business community feeling confident, low interest rates and faster global growth are also likely helping to push stocks higher.", "keywords": ["2017", "jobs", "check", "trumps", "report", "trump", "statements", "growth", "speech", "economic", "times", "thats", "reported", "phoenix", "fact", "protesters"], "polarity": 0.051950585844028466, "subjectivity": 0.4435372732913719},

Disagreements over gun control measures go beyond a clear partisan split between Democrats and Republicans, leaving even the most popular bipartisan proposal stalled in Congress.\n\nSenate leaders had hoped to fast-track a bill to improve the national background check system and send it to the House for quick consideration. But conservative Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, placed a hold on the bill, preventing speedy passage. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday that he does not plan to take up any gun measures until the Senate acts first.\n\n\"We're waiting to see what the Senate can do,\" Ryan said at a weekly press conference. \"We'll find out what the Senate can do, and we'll address that then.\"\n\nRyan said he is deeply disturbed by the shooting and he wants Congress to delve into failures in the existing law enforcement and background check systems that happened in the lead-up to the Florida shooting.\n\nMany Republicans oppose any limits on gun rights for most people. Ryan said the House is focused instead on preventing criminals and people with a history of mental illness from accessing deadly firearms.\n\n\"We do know that there are gaps in the background system that need to be plugged,\" Ryan said. \"We shouldn't be banning guns for law-abiding citizens, we should be focusing on making sure that citizens who shouldn't have guns in the first place don't get them.\"\n\nThe Senate bill would address some of those concerns with narrow changes to how local, state and federal law enforcement agencies share information. It would make it easier for the FBI and local police to update the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\n\nConservatives like Lee say that the Senate bill doesn't address the core problem with the background check system and that they worry it would deny gun owners their right to due process. Lee and Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and John Kennedy, R-La., sent a letter to Senate leaders opposing that bill, saying they worry it \"might lead to an increase in the likelihood of abuse and administrative error.\"\n\nThe Senate bill has also drawn criticism from some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who say the bill doesn't go far enough. Schumer is calling on Congress to pass new, broader background checks.\n\n\"Not just a little something here, a little something there,\" Schumer said Tuesday in a speech on the Senate floor. \"But comprehensive background checks are supported overwhelmingly by the American people.\"\n\nSchumer is also co-sponsor of the narrower Senate bill, which was written in part by Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.\n\nCornyn has complained that the infighting over the narrow bill could be standing in the way of the best opportunity Congress has to pass a gun bill this week.\n\n\"This is our chance to show the nation that we refuse to accept shootings at schools and churches as the new normal,\" Cornyn said Tuesday. \"If our attitude is 'I want everything on my list or nothing,' we're going to end up with nothing.\"", "keywords": ["gun", "schumer", "check", "stalled", "senate", "bill", "background", "congress", "system", "ryan", "bills", "tighten", "say"], "polarity": 0.1439457290676803, "subjectivity": 0.4552527012283109},

Among the magazine's contributors this month: Michele Norris, former host of NPR's All Things Considered.\n\nNorris currently runs The Race Card Project, in which she asks people to send in their thoughts on race in just six words. When she began the project in 2010, Norris assumed she'd hear mostly from people of color. She was wrong.\n\n\"I think what happened, is people felt that they had an entry into a conversation that wasn't always welcome to them,\" Norris tells NPR's Sarah McCammon. \"White Americans \u2014 in very large numbers \u2014 bought into the project and decided to share their stories.\"\n\nIn her National Geographic story, Norris digs into some of the feelings that white Americans have expressed. Her story focuses on the town of Hazleton, Pa. In the year 2000, the population of Hazleton was more than 95 percent white; today it's more than half Latino.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn change being uncomfortable, no matter where it's coming from\n\nWhen people talked about it, it was often the notion of suddenly being outnumbered \u2014 that's a word that I heard over and over and over again. Going to the doctor's office and suddenly looking around and realizing that everybody else is Hispanic. Going to the local Walmart ... and realizing that, \"Boy, the things they're selling in the produce aisle are different,\" or \"There's a whole aisle where everything is in two languages, and I never noticed that before.\" ... \"Suddenly it feels like this community that I knew so well\" \u2014 so what they were saying is that they don't feel like it's \"theirs\" anymore. ...\n\nAnd that coupled with economic changes, with jobs disappearing. And that coupled with \u2014 you know, the cultural things in a town that has had a very strong immigrant population for decades. There were people from Italy, and people from Ireland, and people from Germany and Montenegro and Slovakia and Slovenia, and they all had their traditions. And suddenly they have to make space for newcomers who come in.\n\nAnd that has happened throughout decades in America, but when the newcomers are brown, and when the newcomers speak a different language, and when the newcomers are less interested in assimilating in the same way and suddenly speaking English \u2014 they want to hold on to their old culture or they want to hold on to their old language ... suddenly the word \"immigrant\" when it's spoken now doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nOn race as subtext\n\nThey wouldn't necessarily say \"those brown people,\" or \"those Latino people.\" There would often be sort of proxy for that \u2014 \"the food is different, the music is different, the town feels different.\" There was a large \"threat\" narrative \u2014 safety is a big issue here. People felt like, with the changing community, the crime rate had increased, or that they just didn't feel as safe as they used to.\n\nIn some cases it was for a good reason \u2014 someone had literally driven a car into their restaurant, or someone had had a wallet taken. In a lot of cases, though, the fear was based on something in the abstract, not something that had actually happened to them \u2014 but the fear that if they did go downtown that bad things would happen, or if they did go to the mall that it no longer was as safe as it used to be.\n\nOn the generational shift\n\nThere was a difference in the way that people who were more advanced in years talked about it, than the kids. Because the kids are in probably the most diverse environment \u2014 they all go to the same schools, they play on the same sports teams, they cheer together on the cheerleading squad, to some degree they socialize with each other. ... They had a sort of more direct approach to talk about some of these things than people who still lived in communities where they lived and worshipped among people who looked like them or had a similar background. ...\n\nI remain optimistic, and yet I'm pragmatic. And so I know that when we say that race is perhaps an easier concept for young people ... it's easier, but it's not easy. It's not yet easy. And a mistake that's often made is thinking that because they ... inherited this incredible degree of integration that was completely foreign to just one or two generations ahead of them, that all the problems have been solved. That's not true. ...\n\nI think future is still something that we should be optimistic about, but it might take two, three, four generations before some of this gets easier. And it's not just because of demographics and race, it's also because of the economic tumult that we're facing, and it's also because of technological tumult \u2014 I mean, people's jobs are being replaced in large part by technology, and that creates a certain degree of vertigo.

Board of Education, a yearlong ProPublica investigation found that many schools across the country are back where they were under Jim Crow segregation: racially isolated and under-resourced.\n\nIn Tuscaloosa, Ala., the story of the Dent family underscores what's happened to schools in that city over the past three generations.\n\nJames Dent, a 64-year-old African-American, described watching the roller coaster of integration in his city \u2014 from segregation to integration and now back to segregation, Norris says.\n\nOther Tuscaloosa Students Share Their Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Sophie Fairbairn On Her Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Ryan Foster On His Six Words toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Jazmine Thompson On Her Six Words Enlarge this image toggle caption Amanda Zamora/ProPublica Amanda Zamora/ProPublica James Niller On His Six Words\n\nHis six words for The Race Card Project: \"We went to all-black schools.\"\n\nDent and his wife were part of a generation that saw promise in school integration. And for a time, the local high school, Central High, was a model for integration. Central produced National Merit scholars and winning baseball, football and basketball teams. The school dominated the math championships. Dent's daughter went there and had a great experience.\n\nBut, as ProPublica found, it was hard to maintain that level of integration. First, white families started to peel away. Then, over time, something else happened: \"bright flight.\" Middle-class black families also peeled away from the neighborhood, leaving it not just racially isolated but economically isolated as well.\n\n'A Lot Happens Over Here'\n\nThose shifts had a tremendous impact on Tuscaloosa. Today, schools in the Dents' neighborhood, like Central High, have a white population of less than 1 percent.\n\n\"You see Central getting smaller and smaller,\" James Dent says. \"I don't know why. Central High School is getting smaller and smaller.\"\n\nDent's wife, Beverly, has some opinions as to why. \"A lot happens over here, for one thing,\" she says. \"You know, like shootings, robbery and stuff like that \u2014 that happens over here. Now, it might happen on [the white] side too, but I think it happens over here a lot more than it does over there. And the whites are scared.\"\n\nThere are other schools in the city with more resources than Central. Those schools, like Bryant High, have relatively large white populations. And the larger community views the schools differently, Beverly Dent says.\n\n\"I think Central is not \u2014 what's the word I'm looking for? They look at Central lower than they do Bryant,\" Beverly says. Once upon a time, she says, \"when you went out in the world and said you were from Central, people would say, 'Wow, that's a good school.' ... You got a lot of good people coming out of there, going to college and stuff.\"\n\nBut James Dent's granddaughter, D'Leisha Dent, has had a different experience. She's about to graduate from Central High, and has her own six words for The Race Card Project: \"Segregation should not determine our future.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old is very proud of her school, with its large brick building just a stone's throw from the University of Alabama.\n\nBut as the neighborhood changed, the school changed. D'Leisha says she's especially aware of that when she hears her mother, Melissa Dent, talk about Central High's heyday \u2014 during that brief period when it was integrated. Melissa had friends of all races, including people she still keeps in touch with today.\n\nBut things are different for D'Leisha.\n\n'I'm Gonna Stay On It'\n\n\"Me and my friends always talk about how we wish the schools were not segregated. And, like, we wish we could interact with more Caucasian people, 'cause they seem fun,\" D'Leisha says. \"I don't really know how they are outside of school, but I wish we could have interacted with more people.\"\n\nAnd the community, D'Leisha says, doesn't \"expect much\" from Central students. \"They have low expectations from us. ... It's just some people \u2014 they expect low. They don't expect anything from Central High School.\"\n\nBut D'Leisha has her own inner compass, Norris says. And like so many other high school kids right now, D'Leisha runs to the mailbox every day looking for a college admission letter.\n\n\"I do what I have to do,\" D'Leisha says. \"I'm in honors class, AP \u2014 advanced placement \u2014 and don't settle for less.

Here he is on CNN.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDEMETRI HOTH: We just really want the lawmakers to understand the type of things that we went through by showing them that we're a united front and that we're not going to back down until change actually happens.\n\nMONTAGNE: Now, almost four weeks later, that change is actually beginning to happen. In a move that amounted to a break with his longtime allies at the National Rifle Association, Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott signed into law new regulations on guns. The bipartisan bill, named for the Parkland school that inspired it, bans bump stocks, increases waiting periods, raises the buyer age limit to 21 and broadens the power of police to seize weapons. Governor Scott also called for more police officers in schools to protect students, but armed officers in schools are nothing new. And for students of color, it doesn't make school feel safer.\n\nKAILA CAFFEY: Unfortunately, students of color are often targeted by police officers and tend to be victims of police violence.\n\nMONTAGNE: Kaila Caffey is a senior at Central High School in Philadelphia. She says the issue got her attention when footage surfaced in 2016 of an officer restraining a student at a nearby school.\n\nCAFFEY: He was put into a chokehold while attempting to use the bathroom without a hall pass.\n\nMONTAGNE: Caffey is a member of the Philadelphia Student Union, PSU, which is advocating to remove police from schools. She and her fellow students are just as proactive as the students in Parkland. And though she's supportive of them, she says there's a difference in how the demands from the two groups are being received.\n\nCAFFEY: As a woman of color and with PSU being a predominantly black organization, even in trying to make changes in our own district, we've received a lot of pushback.\n\nMONTAGNE: The Philadelphia Student Union is forging ahead with a school walkout.\n\nCAFFEY: The message that we're hoping to send is that our experience is very different. Students experience violence on a day-to-day basis in their schools. What they're doing now is not helping anybody. In fact, it's harming more students.\n\nMONTAGNE: Student groups from two dozen schools in the Philadelphia area are signed up to participate in that walkout this coming Wednesday.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Bill Cassidy, R-La., touted Tuesday on Capitol Hill that his plan passes the \"Jimmy Kimmel test.\"\n\nThat is a phrase the lawmaker coined back in May because the late night host has been outspoken about his young son's heart condition and the amount of money it would cost someone who didn't have health insurance before the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, became law to obtain the kind of care his son has needed.\n\n\"I ask, 'Does it pass the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\"?' \" Cassidy, a medical doctor, said in May of Republican health care proposals. \"Will a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life? I want it to pass the 'Jimmy Kimmel test.' \"\n\nKimmel pressed Cassidy to follow through on his word in a tweet in June and outlined his definition of the \"Kimmel test,\" which he reiterated Tuesday night.\n\nBut Kimmel said the latest bill doesn't pass the test. He used his late night platform to knock down Cassidy's health care plan, which the GOP is trying to pass by the end of the month, point by point. He said Cassidy, whom Kimmel quizzed on his show before the plan came out, \"lied right to my face.\"\n\n\"Health care is complicated; it's boring; I don't want to talk about it,\" Kimmel said. \"The details are confusing, and that's what these guys are relying on. They're counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information, you just trust them to take care of you. But they're not taking care of you. They're taking care of the people who give them money like insurance companies, and we're all just looking at our Instagram accounts liking things, while they're voting on whether people can afford to keep their children alive or not. Most of the congresspeople who vote on this bill probably won't even read it. And they want us to do the same thing. They want us to treat it like an iTunes service agreement. And this guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face.\"\n\nIn his monologue, Kimmel urged that no matter how much money a family makes, there should be no annual or lifetime caps. Because of the high cost of procedures like open-heart surgery, lifetime or annual caps on what insurers pay out mean families foot the rest of the bill.\n\nSince states decide the rules, according to Cassidy's plan, Kimmel argues that inevitably, there will be states where caps will be instituted and families will be hurt.\n\nKimmel laid out four points that Cassidy had said he wanted in a health care bill:\n\n1. Coverage for all\n\n2. No discrimination based on pre-existing conditions\n\n3. Lower premiums for middle-class families\n\n4. No lifetime caps\n\n\"I'm sorry he does not understand,\" Cassidy said Wednesday morning on CNN about Kimmel, adding that under the new bill, \"more people will have coverage.\"\n\nThat's almost certainly not true, given the Medicaid expansion rollback that would take place under the bill. Medicaid expansion accounted for the largest drop in the uninsured under the ACA.\n\nWhat's more, Republicans are trying to push the bill through before the Congressional Budget Office can weigh in with an analysis of how much it would cost and how many people could lose insurance. Prior versions of Republican health bills care all showed millions more would no longer be insured compared with under the ACA.\n\n\"Not only did he fail the 'Jimmy Kimmel test,' \" Kimmel said, \"it failed the 'Bill Cassidy test.' \"\n\nAs Kimmel drove home his points, the audience groaned. Those groans revealed something else \u2014 the audience, not unexpectedly, was not familiar with the details of the Cassidy plan, which is co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nAnd that raises another important point \u2014 in this era in which trust in politicians, Congress, Washington and democratic institutions, including the news media, is on the decline, people are looking to others they trust to impart and make sense of information.\n\nThat was true of Jon Stewart when he hosted The Daily Show, and polls began to reveal that his show was a principal \"news\" source for many young people.\n\nSo it's not surprising that a popular \u2014 formerly fairly apolitical \u2014 late night host with a compelling personal storyline to draw on could have a broader effect than other traditional influencers.\n\n\"I never imagined I would get involved in something like this,\" Kimmel said. \"This is not my area of expertise. My area of expertise is eating pizza, and that's really about it. But we can't let them do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us.\"\n\nFor those who say Kimmel has crossed over and become too political. He had a message for them, too: \"Before you post the nasty Facebook message saying I'm politicizing my son's health problems, I want you to know, I am politicizing my son's health problems, because I have to.

But he's also been stymied by Congress and by the courts.\n\nHere's a look at what the Trump White House has accomplished on each of those 10 promises \u2014 and what it hasn't.\n\n1. \"We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall.\"\n\nThe border wall remains more aspiration than reality. The Department of Homeland Security is waiving environmental rules to speed up construction of prototypes near San Diego.\n\nBut so far, Mexico has balked at paying for the wall. And so has Congress. The House has appropriated nearly $1.6 billion for the first phase of construction, but the Senate hasn't.\n\n2. \"We are going to end catch and release.\"\n\nAdministration officials say they're following through on Trump's promise to end so-called catch and release. That's how many critics describe the policy that allowed many immigrants to go free until their court dates, which can often be years away because of court backlogs.\n\nIn practice, it's not clear that the Trump administration is handling these cases much differently than previous administrations did.\n\nBut there has been a dramatic drop in the number of people apprehended at the Southwest border since Trump took office \u2014 a 46 percent drop during the first seven months of the year compared to 2016, according to a DHS official. The total for March was the lowest in at least 17 years, although the numbers have started to creep back up since then.\n\n3. \"Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests are up more than 43 percent since late January compared to the same period in 2016, according to a DHS official. \"We are still continuing to prioritize our resources on those individuals that create and pose the greatest public safety and national security threat,\" the official said. Seventy-two percent of those arrested had criminal convictions, a much lower percentage than the final years of the Obama administration.\n\nTrump has pushed Congress for funding to hire more agents for ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But like funding for the border wall, Congress has yet to sign off.\n\n4. \"Block funding for sanctuary cities.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is trying to follow through on that promise to punish so-called sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. DOJ made some law enforcement grants contingent on whether those cities do more to help ICE.\n\nBut Chicago and California quickly took the administration to court. That's in addition to lawsuits filed earlier this year by San Francisco, Seattle and other self-described sanctuary cities.\n\n5. \"Cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\"\n\nThis probably refers to two Obama-era executive actions including DACA, which protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children from deportation.\n\nThe Trump White House dropped its support for a related program called DAPA, which was supposed to help the parents of those children.\n\nBut so far, the White House has allowed DACA to continue, much to the dismay of immigration hard-liners. Texas and other states are threatening to sue if the administration doesn't pull its support for DACA by Sept. 5.\n\n6. \"We are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\"\n\nThis is part of what Trump's travel ban executive order was supposed to do.\n\nThe order Trump signed just a week after taking office would have blocked travelers from seven mostly Muslim countries that the administration says are known havens for terrorists.\n\nFederal courts put the original order on hold. But the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of the travel ban to take effect until it can hear legal challenges to the ban in the fall.\n\n7. \"We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported.\"\n\nTrump pointed out in Phoenix last year that immigrants with criminal records can wind up staying in the U.S. because their home country won't take them back. The White House has reportedly cut the number of non-cooperative countries from 23 to 12. Immigration hawks say that's a big win, and that the administration deserves more credit for it.\n\n8. \"We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.\"\n\nFor years, Congress has required the Department of Homeland Security to create a system to track everyone who comes in and out of the country using biometric technologies like facial recognition or fingerprint scanners.\n\nIn recent years, a majority of new undocumented immigrants have overstayed temporary visas, while the number crossing the border illegally has fallen.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection is testing a few prototype systems at U.S. airports this summer. But experts say a comprehensive solution that will work at more than 300 land, sea and air ports of entry remains a long way off.\n\n9. \"We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\"\n\nIn the spring, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to \"Buy American\" and \"Hire American,\" and urging others to do the same.\n\nBut critics point out that Trump's own companies continue to hire foreign guest workers and manufacture overseas. And just as the White House's \"Made in America\" week was underway in July, the administration announced it would allow an additional 15,000 temporary foreign workers.\n\n10. \"We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the White House threw its support behind the RAISE Act, which would prioritize immigrants with valuable skills and high-paying U.S. job offers, and gradually reduce the number of other foreign nationals who can reunite with their families already living in the U.S. But there seems to be little enthusiasm for the bill in the Senate.", "keywords": ["white", "fact", "check", "administration", "wall", "illegal", "congress", "border", "fight", "immigrants", "house", "order", "trump", "president", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.059213277253049985, "subjectivity": 0.36531139315230216},

I bought a new plan through the marketplace that went into effect last month. I just received policy information, and it states that because the plan does not cover major medical services, I may have to pay additional taxes to the government. I was told that the plan didn't cover major medical, but wasn't told about any taxes. Will I be fined next year?\n\nIt sounds like you bought a plan that doesn't comply with the Affordable Care Act's requirements, and if that's the case you may indeed have to pay a penalty for not having comprehensive coverage when you file your taxes next year.\n\nThe tax reform law repealed the individual penalty for not having health insurance, but that provision doesn't take effect until 2019. So for 2018 you may be charged the greater of $695 or 2.5 percent of your household income.\n\nThe federal- and state-run marketplaces established by the ACA sell only comprehensive plans that cover 10 essential health benefits, including \"major medical\" services like hospitalization and prescription drugs.\n\nBut some insurance broker websites call themselves marketplaces too, says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. And that can be confusing. These companies may sell other insurance products \u2014 like short-term or accident coverage \u2014 alongside comprehensive plans that comply with the law.\n\nEver since the health law was passed, \"There have been opportunistic companies trying to take advantage of consumer confusion to make money,\" Corlette says.\n\nIf you aren't happy with your plan, you may still be able to switch. Losing your employer coverage qualifies you for a 60-day special enrollment period to pick a new plan. Since it appears you're still in that window, you may be able to choose a comprehensive plan.\n\nTo ensure you're using your state's official marketplace, go to healthcare.gov and click on \"see if I can change.\" That will take you to your state marketplace, even if you live in one of the dozen or so states that run their own exchanges.\n\nI'm in a state that is looking into work requirements for Medicaid. At sign-up time, can I simply tell the exchange that I intend to be ineligible for Medicaid by refusing to work and get the premium tax credit to buy a private plan on the insurance marketplace?\n\nFederal health law regulations don't clearly address the situation you describe, but the short answer is probably not, according to policy analysts.\n\nIn general, people who are eligible for employer coverage or Medicaid \u2014 the federal-state health program for people with little income \u2014 can't qualify for federal tax credits that help pay for premiums on plans sold on the health insurance exchanges.\n\nThis year, Kentucky and Indiana became the first states to receive federal approval to require some Medicaid recipients to put in 80 hours each month at a paid job, school or volunteer work (among other activities), to receive benefits. Nearly a dozen other states have made similar requests.\n\nIf you refuse to work, does that make you ineligible for Medicaid? The rules aren't clear, says Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nStates might argue that someone in your situation is eligible for Medicaid \u2014 you just have to fulfill the work requirements, says Timothy Jost, a professor emeritus of law at Washington and Lee University in Virginia, who is an expert on the health law.\n\nThere are other actions people could take \u2014 or fail to take \u2014 where this issue might come up. \"You could argue that someone is not eligible because they haven't completed the Medicaid application or provided the required documentation,\" Jost says. \"There are any number of requirements, but I can't imagine someone saying they didn't do those things and so they're not eligible for Medicaid.\"\n\nWhatever the rules, it's unlikely that many people will be in a position to consider taking this stance. To qualify for premium tax credits, your income must be between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $12,000 to $48,500 for an individual in 2018). But you'd also have to be eligible for Medicaid, generally with an income limit of 138 percent of poverty (about $16,750) in states that expanded coverage to adults. In addition, the Medicaid work requirements in your state would have to apply to you.\n\nI picked a Medicare Part D drug plan that covered all the drugs I take. But as soon as I got my first Novolin R prescription filled, they notified me that they don't cover it anymore. Can they just switch it like that?\n\nMedicare drug plans can change their list of covered drugs, called formularies. If they're doing so at the start of the new calendar year, as appears to have happened in your case, the plan may notify you of the change when you fill the prescription for the first time in the new year. At that time, the plan would typically give you a 30-day transition refill so you can switch to another drug that's on the formulary or start the appeals process to continue taking your current insulin drug, Novolin R.\n\nIf you and your doctor think it's important that you have Novolin R and not another drug that is similar, you can ask your plan to make an exception to allow you to continue to take the drug.\n\nTo go that route, you would need to get your doctor to \"make the case for why that formulary drug is not the right drug\" for you, says Casey Schwarz, senior counsel for education and federal policy at the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group.", "keywords": ["rules", "comply", "coverage", "aca", "penalties", "plan", "tax", "states", "drug", "work", "health", "2018", "requirements", "risk", "insurance", "medicaid"], "polarity": 0.07871444032158317, "subjectivity": 0.4162047773654915},

Which, considering the magazine's history on race, is either intriguing or ironic. Maybe both.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNational Geographic magazine brought the world to readers through meticulous reports and gorgeous photographs. Now it's released an issue on race. It begins with a look in the mirror at how the magazine has portrayed different races and ethnicities over more than a century. Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team reports.\n\nKAREN GRIGSBY BATES, BYLINE: The bright yellow border signals, yes, this is National Geographic. But this special issue isn't inviting readers to visit Peru or Ethiopia in its pages. This time the coverage focuses specifically on race and the role the Geographic has played in its 130-year history in shaping Americans' views on race.\n\nSUSAN GOLDBERG: What we really want to do is to create a conversation about something that is so central to, you know, understanding the United States in the 21st century.\n\nBATES: That's editor-in-chief Susan Goldberg, National Geographic's first woman editor. Goldberg oversaw what most people are calling the race issue. In a letter she wrote for the issue, Goldberg said she felt the magazine couldn't cover race and diversity without acknowledging its own problematic past.\n\nGOLDBERG: And it felt very much to me that if we were going to write about the subject of race, that to do so credibly we needed to look back at our own history.\n\nBATES: John Edwin Mason is a historian at the University of Virginia. He's also African-American. And he was tasked with diving into the archives of the Geographic to see how it relayed the world to its readers. He found a hierarchy.\n\nJOHN EDWIN MASON: And that hierarchy was very clear in the writing and in the photography that the West and especially the English-speaking world was at the top of the hierarchy and black and brown people were somewhere underneath.\n\nBATES: And Mason is clear on why that is.\n\nMASON: You know, it was a magazine that was editorially controlled almost exclusively by white men.\n\nBATES: For more than a century, women, Jewish and black people were denied membership in the National Geographic Society. The race issue contains a scientific look at how and why skin color evolved over time, the rise in interracial and same-gender marriages, racial profiling and white anxiety as the nation gets browner. You'll hear about that in a moment. All this, says Goldberg, is an effort to move forward. But this work is still done by a largely white staff. Historian John Edwin Mason says the Geographic has made progress in the past few decades, but it has a way to go.\n\nMASON: You still won't find very many voices from the Global South writing in the pages of National Geographic. You still see too few photographers of color.\n\nGOLDBERG: We're not there yet.\n\nBATES: But Goldberg says they're working on it. Next month, the Geographic looks at Muslims in America.

Every so often, NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated film 12 Years a Slave packs an emotional wallop. It's based on the memoir of a real person, Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the 1840s. The movie depicts the brutality of the slave system by telling the story of a man who endured it.\n\nThe Race Card Project has seen an uptick in six-word submissions about slavery since the film's release \u2014 particularly from people who have grappled with their own family connections to slavery.\n\nProject curator Michele Norris and Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep both spoke with John Ridley, screenwriter of 12 Years a Slave (and an occasional commentator on Morning Edition), about what he hopes audiences will take away from the film.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how the film has sparked very personal conversations about the nation's history of slavery\n\nWe have to remember, when Solomon wrote his memoir, at that time, this was a best-seller. It became a linchpin in the abolitionist cause. He toured, he spoke. And the story fell into obscurity. And we're having these conversations now, and what people are walking away from this film and this story with is that \u2014 and, by the way, I put myself ... at the head of this list \u2014 is how we really didn't have any concept of what slavery was all about.\n\nSo, I'm not surprised that many people would walk away from this film feeling like they need now to have a true concept or a true conversation about these kinds of things. I'm just sort of shocked that it's taken us this long to really try to excavate what slavery was all about.\n\nOn how he hopes the film will compel exchanges about slavery that aren't mired in guilt or anger\n\nI think what cannot get lost in this is where we've come as a country. And I think there has to be a sense of pride that we have come this far. There's got to be pride for the individuals whose families survived all of this. I think there's got to be pride for those individuals who [can say], \"If my family was like this, I am not.\" ...\n\nMy father was out here in California at [a school \"grandparents' day\"]. ... And a woman from Virginia came up to my dad ... and she said to him, \"Oh, your name is Ridley? ... I used to have family in Virginia named Ridley.\"\n\nAnd my dad just said very casually ... \"Oh, well, you know what, your family, they probably owned our family. They may have. I have family from Virginia.\" And the woman was not shocked, she was not taken aback. She goes, \"Oh, you know what? That's very possible.\" They started researching together, firing letters back and forth, looking to find out if that was true.\n\nI think it's very important for people to not go into it going, \"Oh, if my family did that 160 years ago, that's me.\" As opposed to, \"Why don't we find out what happened? Why don't we find out how we got to a point now where our kids or our grandkids are in the same school, enjoying the same privileges, that we are citizens in the same country and can actually talk about this as opposed to being afraid or horrified about what happened?\"\n\nWhat happened, happened; we can't change that. But we can change who we are in this moment. That's how you move on from this.\n\nOn how he was struck by Solomon Northup and his story\n\n[He was] a man who used every part of himself to survive \u2014 his wits, his guile, his physicality \u2014 but never gave into bitterness, never gave up his faith in other people and the system that completely let him down.\n\nI have two boys. I just said, if I were trying to show these two boys, my two sons, what I thought the character of a man was \u2014 of an American man, of a man of color \u2014 that's what Solomon was when I read this book. And my message was just about character.\n\nOn the importance of a scene in which a slave owner forces Solomon to beat a fellow slave\n\nMost importantly \u2014 and with almost everything that you'll see in the film \u2014 it was that way in the memoir. It was exceptionally important to me to hew as closely as possible to what was happening in the book.\n\nAnd also ... it speaks to the mindset of the slave owner ... played by Michael Fassbender. It would have been very easy ... going to a 2013 mindset, to simply say, \"Well, these individuals are all purely evil, and blacks across the board were just purely saints, and that was it.\" And that scene in particular really spoke to the multifaceted nature of that environment, and what it did to individuals across the board.", "keywords": ["family", "12", "film", "slave", "think", "true", "man", "solomon", "thats", "slavery", "inspires", "conversations"], "polarity": 0.08403604497354498, "subjectivity": 0.5293964947089946},

My mother worked an office job, and had to juggle her career, finishing her degree and raising two young children. With both parents working full time, this left my brother and me in a bit of a free-fall.\n\nBut when I was around four, help arrived. My aunt Nena moved from Mexico to the U.S. \u2014 the plan was for her to live with our family and take care of my brother and me while settling into life in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the time, it seemed like a wonderful idea. My aunt would help with childcare while teaching us Spanish. What no one anticipated was her own eagerness to learn English, essential for her transition to the U.S. And who better to learn from than two native English speakers?\n\nThis resulted, much to everyone's chagrin, in two stubbornly Anglophone children. I can't speak Spanish. It's a simple fact that fills me with shame.\n\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that my situation reflects a question in the broader Latinx community: Just how important is knowing how to speak Spanish, anyway?\n\nThe answer, even among the Latinx community, is complicated. A Pew Research Center study from October of 2017, found that \"while the number of Latinos who speak Spanish at home continues to increase due to the overall growth of the Latino population, the share of Latinos who speak the language has declined over the past decade.\"\n\nIn other words: While the population is growing, a smaller percentage of us are speaking the language. In 2006, 78 percent of Latinxs spoke Spanish at home. By 2015, that number had dropped to 73 percent.\n\nI'm part of that decline. Living in a city with nearly 5 million Latinxs provided me with countless opportunities to engage my culture. I have fond childhood memories of outings to Olvera Street, weekly trips to the local panader\u00eda, and dance lessons in ballet folkl\u00f3rico.\n\nI'm proud of my culture. But despite all this, I struggle with my Mexican identity.\n\nGrowing up, I was told that understanding the language of the home country was of the utmost importance. Sometimes this message was subtle: Spanish-speaking strangers who, after trying and failing to interact with me, would let out a pointed \"\u00bfNo habla espa\u00f1ol?\"\n\nLatinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language 11:40\n\nOther times, it was more explicit \u2014 the gentle (and not-so-gentle) teasing from family and friends for mixing up ser and estar; the uncomfortable silence that fell between my cousins and me, neither of us able to communicate during my family's trips to Mexico.\n\nThis disconnect between language and culture is all too common for Latinx Americans. According to Pew, 71 percent of self-identified Hispanic adults said that you don't need to speak Spanish to be considered Latinx. At the same time, nearly 90 percent say that it's important for future generations of Latinx Americans to speak Spanish.\n\nLanguage is central to just about every cultural identity. And language, particularly for Hispanics, transcends national borders. We have a word for this: Latinidad. It's an understanding that Latin American communities are varied and complex, but connected by a shared language.\n\nFor me, this understanding played out on a personal level. In school, my friends were Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and Salvadoran. We didn't necessarily share a common experience. But Spanish was supposed to be a way we could understand one another despite our different backgrounds.\n\nThis perceived understanding explains the warmth and affection I receive from Hispanic strangers I meet in public. It also accounts for their visible disappointment when I reveal the extent of my American assimilation. Growing up, it didn't matter to my friends or to strangers that I could make tamales or sing my heart out to Selena's Como La Flor (albeit with a bit of stumbling through the lyrics).\n\nIn the view of many of my Hispanic compatriots, I wasn't Mexican-American. I was just American.\n\nMark Hugo Lopez is the Director of Hispanic Research at Pew. He's the researcher who found that a declining proportion of Latinxs speak Spanish. Lopez says that when he talks to Latinxs about how they identify, language often becomes the focal point.\n\n\"A lot of Latinos will say it's important that future generations of Hispanics in the U.S. speak Spanish,\" Lopez says. But, he adds, \"the proof is in the pudding. How many of them actually do? ... There's a lot of tension here about what people want and what actually happens.\"\n\nThat tension exists for good reason. Language is so important because it's \"how we experience the world,\" says Amelia Tseng. She's a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution and a scholar in residence at American University, where she studies multilingualism and identity. \"We live our lives in language.\"\n\nTseng says that's part of why so many people, consciously or not, think of American identity and speaking English as inextricably linked.\n\nAnd it's probably why I have such complicated feelings about being a Mexican-American who can't speak Spanish.\n\nThis feeling, called \"language insecurity\" in the academic community, is especially common among second-generation Latinxs in the U.S., according to Tseng.\n\n\"They kind of feel like they can never win,\" she explains. \"They're just very aware that any moment they could be told, 'You're not doing it right,' and there's sort of a challenge to that part of their identity.\"\n\nDespite this insecurity, Tseng stresses that growing up monolingual, like I did, isn't anyone's fault. For second- and third-generation Latinx Americans, retaining Spanish \"isn't a question of how much you want to keep it. It's a question of how much opportunity you have to keep it.\"\n\nTseng says there are barriers to bilingualism that are often outside of our control: social pressure, stigmatization and discrimination.\n\nUltimately, Tseng adds, it's important for Latinxs to grapple with these sentiments openly. \"It helps people understand themselves and where they come from better. And then they can also make more informed choices about what they want to do.\"\n\nSome people may not want to learn Spanish. \"That's OK,\" she says. \"Let's celebrate all identities, and not just the ones we think are correct.\"\n\nI'm not sure if I'll ever be comfortable with my relationship to Spanish. I mourn the loss of a language that I've been told all my life I have a some sort of claim over.

And for state government coffers, the Republican-led overhaul may not cut as cleanly along ideological lines as Democrats say.\n\nMontana\n\nTake Montana, which Donald Trump won by 20 points. The state Legislature is dominated by Republicans who are championing the new federal tax law as nothing but good news for the state.\n\nBut Montana's governor, Democrat Steve Bullock, warns the tax changes could pose a threat to his state's finances.\n\n\"This is a bad deal for Montana and for families all across the country,\" Bullock wrote in a tweet soon after Congress passed the tax overhaul.\n\nThis month, the head of the governor's budgeting office announced the state could expect to lose $20 million in revenue over the next two years, mainly because of how the federal law changes the way Montana collects corporate income tax.\n\nAnd $20 million is on the low end of projections by state economists.\n\n\"With experts on both sides, we thought it appropriate to err on the side of less loss to state revenue, because that was really the legislative intent in Congress,\" Montana State Budget Director Dan Villa said. \"It was not the intent to have that implication come down on the state.\"\n\nMontana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas says the analysis by the governor's office is nothing but politics.\n\n\"We don't see any impact except positive impacts,\" Thomas said.\n\nThe Montana Legislature meets once every two years, and there are no plans to call a special session to deal with the disagreement over projections. Although, state lawmakers could be called back into session if consensus grows around a loss more than the governor's estimate of $20 million.\n\nNotably, the Montana Department of Revenue suggests it could be more than double that. Director Mike Kadas, a Bullock appointee, cites the fact that Montana is one of 17 states coupling their tax code with federal law in a way that could result in a loss in personal and corporate income tax.\n\nHow Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law How Blue States Are Making End Run Around New GOP Tax Law Listen \u00b7 10:25 10:25\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland is not one of those 17. The Mid-Atlantic, left-leaning state is expecting a windfall from the Republican-led update to the federal tax code.\n\nThe state comptroller's office expects a boost to state and local income tax revenue of at least $300 million in a single year, unless the state General Assembly acts to prevent it.\n\nMaryland's tax code is more directly coupled with the federal code, so Maryland taxpayers can take most of the same deductions on their federal and state tax returns.\n\n\"It's a very sensible choice that almost all states have made, basically to allow taxpayers who have calculated their taxes for the federal purposes just to take those same calculations, make just a couple of tweaks to figure out how much they owe the state,\" said Andrew Blair-Stanek, a tax specialist who teaches at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n\nThis is intended to simplify the tax-filing process for residents, as well as enforcement for the state. But it also means taxpayers can only deduct something from their state taxes if they have already deducted it from their federal taxes.\n\nThe new federal law increases the standard deduction while limiting some previous deductions, such as the one for state and local taxes. As a result, roughly 700,000 Maryland residents who itemized deductions on their past tax returns will shrink their federal tax bills if they switch to the standard deduction, said Andrew Schaufele, director of the state Bureau of Revenue Estimates in the comptroller's office.\n\nBut if all 700,000 take the standard deduction on both their federal and state tax returns, the state is expected to collect about $483 million more.\n\nThe federal changes also reduce the personal exemption that taxpayers can claim on their income taxes to zero. Schaufele said it's unclear whether this would eliminate Maryland's personal exemption. If it does, state revenues stand to gain another $1.2 billion.\n\nFor states expecting a financial boost from the federal changes, \"in the short run, it could turn out to be a great thing,\" said Blair-Stanek. \"But over the long run, it will definitely increase the pressure on state and local governments to reduce taxes, or at least rein in increases.\"\n\nMaryland lawmakers have promised to pass legislation protecting taxpayers from the increases by the time the state's 90-day General Assembly session ends in April.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said last week that he will introduce legislation allowing taxpayers to itemize deductions on their state returns even if they take the standard deduction on their federal returns.\n\n\"Under our proposed legislation, Marylanders will not pay one cent more in state taxes as a result of the actions at the federal level,\" he said.\n\nLeaders of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly are joining with Hogan to clarify the law and eliminate any risk to the state personal exemption \u2014 and at the same time seizing an opportunity to criticize congressional Republicans and Trump.\n\n\"It's an economic war between the red states against the blue states,\" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller.\n\nEven if so, the new federal tax code doesn't seem to be as accurate a weapon as feared.\n\nCorin Cates-Carney is Montana Public Radio's Capitol Bureau reporter.

Joined on stage by punk icon Marky Ramone and the prolific jazz artist Ron Carter, and surrounded by a packed crowd of club owners, DJs, dance activists and city employees, de Blasio joked that the soon-to-be-appointed Night Mayor of New York is \"one of the coolest job titles you could ever hope to have.\" The Office of Nightlife and its advisory group will act as liaisons between various aspects of the nightlife industry and local communities, and are modeled after similar initiatives in London, Amsterdam and other European cities.\n\nDrafted by Brooklyn Council Member Rafael Espinal (D-37), a Bed-Stuy native first elected to the New York State Assembly at the age of 26 and currently in his first term as a council member, the bill is the first in a docket of legislation that aims to support the city's vibrant nightlife culture. De Blasio's signature was the culmination of advocacy that has spanned decades.\n\nBut there is one more bill, also from Espinal and also dealing with nightlife in the city \u2014 No. 1652 \u2014 to push through City Hall, with the potential to address a pernicious, racially motivated law that has followed \"fringe\" musical scenes in the city for nearly a century.\n\nWhen Mercedes Ellington, granddaughter of jazz great Duke, stood in front of the New York City Council last Thursday, it was to testify in support of No. 1652. Introduced by Espinal earlier this year, the proposal would repeal the so-called \"Cabaret Law,\" a New York City rule established in 1926 that disallows dancing in cabarets and public halls without a special license. \"The freedom to be beyond category, to explore and express, through music and dance, is our human responsibility,\" Ellington said. \"The current cabaret laws were designed to restrict, curtail and separate those freedoms.\"\n\nIn parallel to, and urged on by Espinal's presentation of these bills, outcry over the Cabaret Law has boiled over. At last week's hearing, Brooklyn nightclub owner John Barclay, a founder of the pro-repeal Dance Liberation Network, characterized the law as being \"absurd, antiquated, racist and extremely embarrassing for our city.\"\n\nFor anyone who likes to go out at night in New York City, whatever their musical pleasure, this Prohibition-era rule has long been a running, if not especially funny, joke. Signs reading \"NO DANCING\" still hang in barrooms throughout the city \u2014 and while the law's effect is paraphrased as making it \"illegal to dance\" in New York, that description is technically untrue. What is unlawful is for a New York City establishment to host dancing without the proper license from the Department of Consumer Affairs.\n\nThe current law, as explained on the City of New York's website, states that \"a place that is open to the public and sells food or drinks must have a Cabaret License to allow customers to dance.\" But according to nightlife professionals, obtaining this license is onerous, expensive and redundant, adding extra layers of paperwork to a process that already requires approval from the Department of Buildings, Fire Department, State Liquor Authority, Department of Health, commercial insurance companies and community boards, among other entities.\n\nIn a departure from past administrations, the one currently in office has pledged its unequivocal backing to the repeal. \"The Mayor strongly supports repealing the law, while retaining several security requirements key to the public's safety. We feel there are better ways than the current law to create a strong nightlife economy that doesn't endanger those involved,\" Ben Sarle, deputy press secretary for Mayor de Blasio, told NPR.\n\nNew York City's dance-music culture is especially thriving of late, and a number of key players in the scene have rallied hard for the law's repeal. Under the larger banner of Let NYC Dance, groups like Dance Liberation Network, Dance Parade, NYC Artist Coalition and others have mobilized their masses, uniting with representatives of multiple musical genres and social justice nonprofits. Council Member Espinal has connected with many of these groups, drafted progressive nightlife-related legislation and gained the support of the Mayor's office along the way.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1926, at a meeting of the Municipal Assembly of the City of New York during which the Cabaret Law was decided upon, the minutes read: \"There has been altogether too much running 'wild' in some of these night clubs and, in the judgment of your Committee, the 'wild' stranger and the foolish native should have the check-rein applied a little bit. ... Your Committee believes that these 'wild' people should not be tumbling out of these resorts at six or seven o'clock in the morning to the scandal and annoyance of decent residents on their way to daily employment.\" It's widely understood that the Cabaret Law was written with the intent to impose control over black clubs in Harlem and impede miscegenation.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bettmann/Getty Images Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nLast week's hearing was held in the same room as that assembly 90 years prior. (Surely the fashion in the current-day chambers tends more colorful \u2014 one speaker sported transparent, four-inch-tall platform boots and sky-blue hair.) In her testimony last week, Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, a cofounder of the DJ collective Discwoman, promoter, booking agent and leader of Dance Liberation Network, posed a question both rhetorical and actual: \"Why are we hanging onto a law that has been used historically and systematically to oppress black folks and other marginalized communities?\"\n\nThe law, as it was originally written, inflicted strict curfews and specific rules upon a burgeoning jazz scene. No more than three musicians were allowed to play onstage without the venue securing the proper license, making most jazz bands verboten (that rule was declared unconstitutional in 1988). The \"cabaret card\" aspect of the law, which stood from the early '40s till 1967, demanded that all cabaret workers \u2014 from the bartender to the piano player \u2014 be fingerprinted, photographed and subject to a background check. The city capriciously revoked cards for bad behavior \u2014 Thelonious Monk and Billie Holiday were banned from gigging in NYC for periods of time because of minor drug offenses.\n\nHistorically, it wasn't just jazz that bore the brunt of the city's enforcements. News articles from the '60s detail the licensing struggles suffered by folk clubs in Greenwich Village, and the famed discotheques of the '70s and '80s often operated along the edges of legality. Following the Happy Land arson tragedy in 1990, policing stepped up at underground social clubs uptown.\n\nBut it was under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's term where the weaponization of the law was most severe. Giuliani's MARCH (Multi-Agency Response to Community Hotspots) task force worked to squelch NYC's nightlife, in reaction to grisly reports of deaths and drugs in clubland. MARCH agents would patrol bars and clubs looking for infractions such as patrons moving their bodies to music; if the venue hadn't secured the proper cabaret license, it was cause for fines, and could lead to closure.\n\nDance-music aficionados and music-industry professionals have previously tried, and failed, to strike the law. Though Giuliani's Broken Windows tactics made the city safer, it also caused some of New York's cultural capital to drain away. \"There was a moment in the late '90s when electronic-music culture was emerging into the global mainstream,\" says Eric Demby, founder of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg, and a cofounder of Legalize Dancing NYC, a group formed around 1999. \"We were going to places like Berlin, Detroit, London and San Francisco, and everyone had this cool version of the dance-music scene. But we would come home to New York, the greatest city in the world, and the city was holding back the culture.\"\n\nAttempts to repeal the law floundered in City Hall in the mid-2000s; ultimately, it wasn't the right political moment, says Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer and former director of the NYCLU. In 2005, Siegel brought a case to NYS Supreme Court, to judicially challenge the Cabaret Law by arguing that expressive dancing is a constitutional right. He lost. Siegel still feels that the decision in that case was wrong. The Cabaret Law is \"bad for New York,\" he says. \"Every denial of expressive activity is a serious infringement. You can't give the government an inch because then they take a foot, then they take a yard, and you wake up one morning and you don't have expressive rights any more. Dancing is a fundamental civil right.\"\n\nThough no doubt significant, \"removing the cabaret license is first a symbolic gesture to right a historical wrong,\" says Espinal. Yet there is work to be done to fine-tune the bill, and properly communicate to the public exactly what the repeal will accomplish. \"It's good symbolism, and symbolism we agree with,\" says Rob Bookman, a lawyer, lobbyist and counsel for the NYC Hospitality Alliance, an industry group. But Bookman cautions that \"repealing the cabaret law will not increase by one space, by one place, where you can legally dance.\" (The only people who might resent the law's removal are the 104, at the time of this writing, establishments in NYC who already went through the arduous licensing process.)\n\ntoggle caption Jane Lerner\n\nNightclubs in NYC are severely limited by zoning restrictions and street-level quality of life concerns, and their existences remain contingent upon the approval of numerous state and city agencies. Indeed, if the Cabaret Law disappears, the city will continue to impose a serious set of rules on nightclub operators who host dance parties.\n\n\"Dancing equals security and surveillance,\" says Barclay, the bar owner. In fact, the language around security staff and surveillance cameras that exists in the current version of the Cabaret Law will remain in the city's administrative code. \"We don't have an issue with safety regulations,\" Barclay says, but he points out that 200 people dancing in a club legally requires more security measures than a group of 1,000 watching MMA fighting at a sports bar. The creation of the Office of Nightlife is intended to address and rectify such concerns.\n\nAfter decades of attempts by activists, lawyers, and industry groups, why is the city agreeing to this reformation? A more diverse and left-leaning city government is one factor, and the current crews of pro-dance advocates have been organized and relentless, actively inspired by the national political climate. \"We're all looking for a light and this was one that felt hopeful,\" Hutchinson tells NPR. \"Even if dancing in bars isn't the most pressing issue, it's still part of the same oppressive system.\" All the players admit that finishing off the Cabaret Law, once and for all, is the right move.\n\nCouncil Member Espinal sees this work as part of a larger political picture. \"At a time when we are discussing the removal of statues with repressive history, it would only make sense [to] support removing a historically discriminatory law,\" he says.\n\nJamie Burkart, a founding member of NYC Arts Coalition, agrees. \"This is a time where we need our community spaces more than ever,\" Burkart says. \"I feel confident in 2017 that our city leaders can stand up and say that a law that was created to discriminate, a law that we have the complete power to change, is not going to stand.\"", "keywords": ["verging", "york", "nyc", "license", "repeal", "law", "dancing", "nightlife", "city", "cabaret", "dance", "legitimizes"], "polarity": 0.07187777082355395, "subjectivity": 0.41021314696013494},

I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? ... [Jefferson] was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue?\" \u2014 President Trump, Aug. 15, 2017\n\nThe president made this statement Tuesday while jabbing at reporters over a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nAnd he used one of his standard rhetorical techniques, \"whataboutism.\"\n\nWhile defending the protesters and claiming that they weren't all white supremacists, he changed the subject to attack others. \"What about the alt-left?\" he said, when asked about the white nationalist alt-right. (\"Alt-left\" is a term seemingly invented for whataboutism, making liberals seem like the moral equivalents of the \"alt-right,\" whose members coined that term themselves.)\n\nThe president's whataboutism on history is the focus here.\n\n\"Are we going to take down statues of George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson?\" Trump asked, given Washington's and Jefferson's slave ownership. He added, \"You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\"\n\nWell, let's take on those questions. The president is not the first person to ask.\n\nWashington did own slaves \u2014 and does not get a pass for freeing them at the end of his life. Jefferson was a \"major slave owner,\" too \u2014 and is even more to be criticized, because he understood that slavery was wrong, calling it a \"moral depravity\" and a \"hideous blot.\"\n\nNor were they alone among our Founding Fathers: James Madison was a slave owner; even Benjamin Franklin owned two slaves before the practice was banned in Pennsylvania. Slavery was so deeply entrenched in the economy that it touched nearly everyone who lived before the Civil War, even those who did not own a slave.\n\nThis is an awkward reality for the keepers of memorials and historic sites. Keepers of the Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's home, have been forced to wrestle with the reality that he took Indian land, used enslaved laborers on multiple plantations and even personally chased escaped slaves. The Hermitage has responded by expanding displays showing the dark side of this historic figure, but it is not planning to tear down the house.\n\nSo \"whatabout\" them? Must they all go if Robert E. Lee goes?\n\nNot necessarily, because they are not all the same.\n\nSome figures stood for something larger. Washington guided the foundation of a country that eventually preserved freedom for all. Jefferson authored the Declaration of Independence, in which a single phrase \u2014 \"that all men are created equal\" \u2014 became a hammer that later generations would use to help smash the chains of slavery.\n\nIt's possible to make a case for honoring such men, so long as we are also honest about their flaws. They were participants in a great experiment in self-government, which has expanded over time to embrace more and more people of all races, not to mention women, too.\n\nSo \"whatabout\" Lee? What did he stand for?\n\nLee, who is connected by marriage to the family of Washington, resigned from the Army to fight against his country, on the Confederate side in the Civil War.\n\nThen and later, Confederate apologists dismissed the idea that they were fighting to defend slavery. They said they were fighting for \"states' rights\" or against Northern oppression. But conflict over slavery was what drove the fight for states' rights and divided the country for years before the war. The election of Abraham Lincoln, a president who was critical of slavery, triggered the rebellion.\n\nAnd the Confederate vice president, Alexander H. Stephens, was more frank than others in stating the rebels' aims. In an 1861 speech, he declared that the \"cornerstone\" of the Confederacy was \"that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.\"\n\nOther Confederates may have fought for different reasons; it is said that Lee went over to the rebel side because he could not bear to fight against his native Virginia. But Stephens' \"cornerstone\" speech accurately describes the larger cause that Lee willingly served and generally accepted: a drive to overturn the idea of equality, which Stephens called an \"error.\" This cause was the reason that many Confederate statues were built in the era of Jim Crow segregation, from after Reconstruction to the civil rights movement starting in the 1950s. Aside from Southern \"heritage\" or \"pride,\" many explicitly represented white supremacy.\n\nThere is still a case to be made for Lee as a brilliant general, who won battle after battle and kept his army together for years, even though it was massively outnumbered and undersupplied. He is a significant figure in the American story.\n\nUlysses S. Grant, the general who defeated him, gave the best epitaph of Lee, saying the Confederate general \"had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought.\"\n\nBut let's be honest. In Charlottesville over the weekend, the \"Unite the Right\" protesters chanted \"blood and soil\"; others listened to Richard Spencer, who has called for an all-white homeland. Members of one group, Identity Evropa, \"seem to revel in goading counter-protesters into violent clashes,\" according to a profile of a member on KQED. Counterprotesters were indeed goaded into clashes \u2014 and a car, allegedly driven by an Ohio man on the white-nationalist side, drove into them, killing a woman.\n\nIs it remotely possible that Spencer and Identity Evropa and the driver of a Dodge Challenger came to defend the statue of Lee because of his skill in military tactics and strategy?\n\nTo have such defenders says a lot about the cause that Lee represented.

She always knew her ancestors had once owned slaves, but had been told again and again, particularly by her Southern grandmother, that the family's slaves had been treated well.\n\n\"She was matter-of-fact that the family had owned slaves in the past,\" Byroade says, \"and emphasized that we did not come from 'plantation-type' families \u2014 that our slaves had been trusted house servants.\"\n\n\"At first this seemed OK to me because it was OK to her,\" Byroade continues. \"But eventually I understood that the domination of another person's free will was unacceptable.\"\n\nIn 1844, an 8-year-old girl was purchased at a slave auction. The girl, named Harriet, served as a maid to Byroade's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother.

He found Harriet's bill of sale and gave it to a library assistant named Todd Perry, one of Harriet's descendants. You can read more about Clegg, Perry and Harriet here.\n\n\"Even going back to her childhood, this is something that she's struggled with,\" Michele Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep. \"The things she saw in textbooks or the stories she saw on TV \u2014 shows like the miniseries Roots \u2014 didn't necessarily square with the genteel stories about slavery she heard at the family dinner table.\"\n\nOne childhood incident left a particular psychological mark on Byroade. When she was 10 years old, her class was tasked with an assignment about their immigrant ancestors.\n\n\"And I let drop that my family had owned slaves,\" Byroade recalls. \"The school that I attended was probably about, at the time, 60 or 70 percent African-American. ... And I did not think that I was boasting.\"\n\nOn her way home from school that day, a group of black classmates and their older siblings went looking for her, Byroade says. \"And those children ... decided that they had to chase me, and they had to scream at me, and they had to yell at me.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Shedrick Robinson Courtesy of Shedrick Robinson\n\nThat episode stayed with Byroade, and deepened her interest in trying to understand this historical chasm in America \u2014 something that became even more complicated the more she learned about her own family's history.\n\nA distant cousin discovered that when Byroade's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother arrived in the U.S. from Ireland in the 1800s, a black child immediately was purchased to serve as a handmaiden, Byroade says.\n\n\"And when she discovered that this child had been purchased ... slavery was not just this abstract idea,\" Norris says. \"The history was then attached to a person. It wasn't just an abstraction.\"\n\nThe child's name was Harriet, and she \"was a young child in the Indian Territory, scooped up by outlaws and used to cover a bet on a horse race,\" Byroade says.\n\nByroade takes pride in the fact that she has surrounded herself with all kinds of diversity. She lives in a diverse neighborhood, she attends a diverse church, and her kids belong to diverse Girl Scout troops. But her family pride isn't quite what it once was.\n\n\"I think you can feel pride in the legitimate accomplishments of your ancestors. But I don't think you can feel pride in the fact that they owned slaves,\" Byroade says. \"I don't think you can feel pride that the wealth and prestige was accomplished on the backs of people who were not free, who had no say, who were subject to your whims.\n\n\"We are very shy in this culture about calling out the great wickedness of slavery, and we should not be,\" she says. \"We must not be.\"", "keywords": ["owned", "family", "familys", "comes", "girl", "slaveowning", "byroade", "slaves", "pride", "byroades", "think", "harriet", "past", "race", "woman", "terms"], "polarity": 0.057317073170731724, "subjectivity": 0.39837398373983746},

Its economy is booming. And Brown touted a list of bipartisan accomplishments: a pension overhaul, a new budget reserve, and an extension of the state's cap-and-trade program to combat climate change.\n\n\"Their passage demonstrates that some American governments can actually get things done, even in the face of deepening partisan division,\" the governor said, taking a shot at Congress.\n\nHe is California's longest-serving governor, a three-time Democratic presidential candidate, and a one-of-a-kind American politician. And Thursday's Assembly speech was his final State of the State address.\n\nHe told lawmakers that California is prospering and laid out a path for the state to continue its progress \u2014 but issued dire warnings on a global scale.\n\nOur world, our way of life, our system of governance \u2014 all are at immediate and genuine risk. Endless new weapons systems, growing antagonism among nations, the poison in our politics, climate change. All of this calls out fo courage, for imagination and for generous dialogue.\n\nAs he looked ahead to his 16th and final year at the helm, Brown called for fresh looks at California's criminal justice system, which has ballooned over the last half-century; and how the state manages its forests to reduce the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe governor also made the case for the transportation funding law he signed last year, which voters will likely decide the fate of in November.\n\n\"Fighting a gas tax may appear to be good politics, but it isn't. I will do everything in my power to defeat any repeal effort that may make it to the ballot. You can count on that!\" Brown said, drawing applause from Democrats while Republicans sat on their hands.\n\nHe also continued his unflagging support of two signature infrastructure projects: the Delta tunnels and high-speed rail.\n\n\"Yes, there are critics, there are lawsuits and there are countless obstacles,\" he said. \"But California was built on dreams and perseverance and the bolder path is still our way forward.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nBut even many Democrats struggle with these projects' costs. And Republicans blame Sacramento Democrats \u2014 including Brown \u2014 for California's skyrocketing cost of housing and other vital expenses.\n\nAssembly GOP Leader Brian Dahle, who represents rural northeastern California, talked about the challenges facing his neighbor, a single mother of four.\n\n\"Her cost of living is going up,\" he said after the speech. \"They just passed a gas tax last year; that drives up her transportation costs. Energy costs are going up. And she has to decide whether she's going to put food on the table, turn the heat up.\"\n\nDahle said small businesses like his are \"dying of a thousand cuts.\"\n\nThursday's was not a speech that railed against President Trump or sought to fire up \"the resistance.\" Brown did not mention Trump by name, though he acknowledged the president for approving federal funds to fight wildfires.\n\nAnd despite threats from the Trump administration to arrest state and local politicians who defy federal immigration laws, the governor \u2014 who just months ago signed California's \"sanctuary state\" law \u2014 skipped the subject entirely.\n\nThat didn't trouble legislative Democrats like Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.\n\n\"What a lot of us have come to understand,\" Rendon said afterwards, \"is that the best way we can fight against Donald Trump \u2014 the best way we can fight against everything that's happening in Washington, DC \u2014 is to be successful.\"\n\nInstead of dwelling on the president, Brown went global, noting that the Doomsday Clock had just moved the minute hand to 11:58 \u2014 as close as it's been to midnight since the height of the Cold War.\n\n\"Our world, our way of life, our system of governance \u2014 all are at immediate and genuine risk,\" the governor said. \"Endless new weapons systems, growing antagonism among nations, the poison in our politics, climate change. All of this calls out for courage, for imagination and for generous dialogue.\"\n\nJerry Brown is not the most sentimental of politicians. But the governor, who turns 80 in April, seemed to linger in the moment, knowing his time in public office will end in less than a year.\n\nAs he wrapped up to a standing ovation, Brown stepped back to the microphone to offer a window into his state of mind.\n\n\"Keep going!

President Trump said it in a Thursday speech in West Virginia, and House Speaker Paul Ryan mentions it a lot.\n\nThe claim: The U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.\n\nThe short answer: That is generally true, though many businesses end up paying far less than the statutory rate.\n\nThe long answer: The U.S. has the highest top corporate tax rate at least among advanced economies. Compared with nations in the OECD \u2014 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of highly developed countries \u2014 the U.S. has the highest top corporate tax rate in the world. The top corporate tax rate in the U.S., a combination of federal and state and local taxes, is nearly 39 percent this year. That's well above most other OECD nations.\n\nTrump would like to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and Ryan has reportedly said that 20 percent to 25 percent is more realistic. Either way, doing so would pull the U.S. well away from the top of this list.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnyway: The \"mostly\" in the \"mostly true\" here comes from the fact that a couple of other places beat out the U.S., outside of OECD countries. According to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, the U.S. comes in third out of 188, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. (Tax Foundation's list includes some U.S. territories.)\n\nHowever, it's not quite that simple. Those rates above are the statutory rates \u2014 the rates set by law. And that is not the rate that many companies in the U.S. end up paying. Deductions and credits help push down businesses' total tax liability, meaning that many companies end up paying far less than the statutory rate. Here is the average effective tax rate for U.S. corporations.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe U.S. is still toward the top of the spectrum, but it's nowhere near the ultra-high level (relative to other countries) that the statutory rate is at.\n\nWhen many politicians talk about overhauling the tax code, both on the corporate and income side, they talk about this discrepancy between effective rates and statutory rates \u2014 the phrase often used is \"broaden the base, lower the rates\" (or some configuration thereof). The idea is to lower the statutory rates but close some of the loopholes that push those effective rates so far from the statutory rates.\n\nOne other way to put corporate tax rates in perspective: the total size of corporate revenue. That has fallen off over time.\n\nAnd on this measure, U.S. corporate taxation isn't all that big compared with other countries'. As of 2014, U.S. corporate tax revenues were at around 2.2 percent of the GDP. The OECD average was 2.8 percent.\n\nLikewise, the share of government revenue as a whole that comes from corporations has fallen off over time, a fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders highlighted on the presidential campaign trail \u2014 the idea being that the government has grown less reliant on corporate tax revenue.\n\nLoading...\n\nThere are a number of factors at play here. The top corporate tax rate has been lowered over the years, for example; in the late 1960s, it was as high as 52.8 percent.\n\nBut it's also true that over time, businesses have increasingly paid taxes through the income tax code, as the Tax Foundation points out. \"C-corporations\" pay corporate taxes, but \"S-corporations,\" also known as \"pass-through entities,\" pay through the individual income tax code. S-corporations include many small businesses run by middle-class Americans, but some very wealthy Americans, including Trump, also own S-corporations, as the New York Times pointed out this spring.\n\nAll this jargon has been important to the tax overhaul fight already, as Republicans have considered imposing a cap on pass-through income. That is \u2014 the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent is the top rate an S-corporation might pay. Trump has floated a 15 percent cap on pass-through income, which would cut taxes for some S-corporations massively. But this plan has been heavily criticized, with opponents saying it would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and encourage people to reconfigure their businesses to avoid paying taxes.", "keywords": ["rates", "does", "check", "tax", "businesses", "rate", "taxes", "highest", "income", "statutory", "scorporations", "corporate", "fact", "world"], "polarity": 0.1275830527497194, "subjectivity": 0.4094323392656725},

Arrests\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Stephen Lam/Reuters Stephen Lam/Reuters\n\nJames Schwab has resigned from his job as a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, saying he didn't agree with Trump administration officials' use of \"misleading facts\" to attack Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf after the mayor issued a warning about an immigration sweep in late February.\n\n\"I quit because I didn't want to perpetuate misleading facts,\" Schwab told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I asked them to change the information. I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn't agree with that. Then I took some time and I quit.\"\n\nIn that four-day sweep through Northern California, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers arrested 232 people \u2014 but high-level federal officials, including President Trump, said Schaaf was to blame for 864 more people not being arrested. They pointed to her public warning of a pending raid, which she issued on Feb. 24, just as the operation was about to begin.\n\nICE agents had targeted more than 1,000 people in the sweep. After the raid, a Homeland Security official said it's common for a large-scale immigration sweep to net about a third of its targets, as member station KQED reports.\n\nTrump called what Schaaf did \"a disgrace,\" saying her warning was the sole reason that hundreds of people escaped arrest. His remarks amplified attacks by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and acting ICE Director Thomas D. Homan. Their claims were questioned by critics \u2014 and now by Schwab, a veteran public affairs officer who had worked at the Defense Department and NASA.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption The Washington Post/Getty Images The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n\"I didn't feel like fabricating the truth to defend ourselves against [the mayor's] actions was the way to go about it,\" Schwab told the Chronicle. \"We were never going to pick up that many people. To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren't picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.\"\n\nIn his attack on Schaaf, Trump said 85 percent of the targeted immigrants had criminal records. But when KQED asked ICE to explain why the targeted people had been classified as threats to public safety, a spokeswoman cited only five, of the 864, who had been convicted of serious crimes.\n\nFrom KQED:\n\n\"Of the 232 people arrested, ICE stated that 115, or just under half, had 'prior felony convictions for serious and violent offenses' or past convictions for 'significant or multiple misdemeanors.' The other half had no criminal history. \"When asked to specify how many arrestees were felons, spokeswoman Danielle Bennett would only respond, 'all of those arrested were arrested for being in violation of immigration law.' \"\n\nIn addition to sparking criticism from the Trump administration, the case also prompted the government to look into whether Schaaf may have broken any laws by sounding the alarm about the pending raid \u2014 another front in the clash between federal officials and the leaders of sanctuary cities.\n\nSchwab has now quit his job as a Homeland Security spokesman in San Francisco \u2014 but that shouldn't be taken to mean that he agrees with what Schaaf did.\n\n\"Personally I think her actions were misguided and not responsible,\" Schwab told CNN. \"I think she could have had other options. But to blame her for 800 dangerous people out there is just false. It's a false statement because we never pick up 100 percent of our targets. And to say they're a type of dangerous criminal is also misleading.\"\n\nOf the battle over how to properly characterize the events, Schwab said, \"I've never been in this situation in 16, almost 17 years in government where someone asked me to deflect when we absolutely knew something was awry \u2014 when the data was not correct.\"\n\nAfter the raid, Homan accused Schaaf of creating a dangerous situation for ICE agents. And when he announced the immigration arrests last month, Homan included this jab at the Oakland mayor:\n\n\"However, 864 criminal aliens and public safety threats remain at large in the community, and I have to believe that some of them were able to elude us thanks to the mayor's irresponsible decision. Unlike the politicians who attempt to undermine ICE's critical mission, our officers will continue to fulfill their sworn duty to protect public safety.\"\n\nOn March 7, Sessions extrapolated on Homan's remarks, converting the ICE leader's rough estimate that \"some of\" the 864 targets had escaped because of Schaaf into a statement that 800 failed arrests lay at the mayor's feet:\n\n\"According to Acting Director Homan, ICE failed to make 800 arrests that they would have made if the mayor had not acted as she did. \"Those are 800 wanted aliens that are now at large in that community \u2014most are wanted criminals that ICE will now have to pursue with more difficulty in more dangerous situations, all because of one mayor's irresponsible action.\"\n\nTrump said in a Cabinet meeting, \"What the mayor of Oakland did the other day was a disgrace. Where they had close to 1,000 people, ready to be gotten, ready to be taken off the streets. ... The mayor of Oakland went out, and she went out and warned them all: scatter.\"\n\nAlso last week, Sessions announced a lawsuit against California for impeding federal immigration enforcement and said, \"You can be sure I'm going to use every power I have to stop that.\"\n\nVisiting Sacramento, Sessions said, \"So here's my message for Mayor Schaaf: How dare you?

How dare you distort the reality about declining violent crime rates in a diverse, sanctuary city like Oakland to advance a racist agenda?\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown criticized Sessions and called on him to apologize, saying his claims about Schaaf were \"simply not true\" and were politically motivated.\n\nThen came the remarks from Trump \u2014 and another response from Oakland's mayor.\n\n\"I'm proud to live in a country where everyone can criticize elected officials,\" Schaaf said in response to a reporter's question about Trump.\n\nThe war of words with Washington has put a new spotlight on Schaaf, 52, who took office in 2015 and is now running for a second term.\n\n\"An insult from Donald Trump is a compliment to a California Democrat,\" political consultant Jim Ross tells The Mercury News in San Jose.\n\nThe newspaper also spoke to California Republican strategist Matt Rexroad, who said: \"I can't think of a single district that includes the City of Oakland, or any statewide office, where that would be a disadvantage.

I actually think the overseer's name was 'Greif,' but I could not help but see it as Grief,\" Goins says.\n\n\"Grief is here. Grief will not let me go any further until I acknowledge it. Finding grief stopped me in my tracks,\" he adds.\n\nEven 10 years later, the discovery still affects him, Goins says. He vividly recalls rolling his fingers across the microfiche image and seeing his ancestors listed among livestock and farm implements. He says he felt like a swimmer who needed to find air.\n\nTo get his head back above water, Goins kept digging. He needed to find some stories, he says, \"that were not as difficult to handle. ... I needed stories where [my ancestors] were ... autonomous, they were doing things, they were living, they had children, you could see their movement. They weren't put on a place and [told], 'You had to stay here.' \"\n\nSo Goins dug into another branch of the family, he says. And he found a very different document in \"The Order Book,\" held at the Albemarle County Courthouse in Charlottesville, Va. The book, Norris explains, was akin to a government census used to keep track of free black people in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nGoins found a reference there to his great-great-great-grandfather, Michael Goings, who was born in 1805 or 1806 in Albemarle County, Va., and lived as a freeman.\n\nRobert Goins' great-great-great-grandfather was noted in a 19th century Order Book, used to track free black people in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

He moved from Ohio to Michigan during the runup to the Civil War and moved back to Ohio after the Civil War,\" Goins explains. \"His wife died a few months before he did.\"\n\nDiscovering an ancestor who was born in a state where 90 percent of black people were enslaved \u2014 and who nevertheless managed to obtain his freedom \u2014 meant everything to Goins, Norris explains. \"The fact that he worked and earned wages \u2014 that finally made him feel like his head was above water,\" she says.\n\nAs Goins describes it, \"I felt grounded. I felt like, 'Wow, why didn't I know this all of my life?' This is what I needed. I needed this to help me in difficult times. I needed to hear that they survived and that I could survive as well.\"\n\nNevertheless, Goins still feels burdened by his discovery. The history he has uncovered is still difficult to talk about, he says, even with members of his own family. That's something the Race Card Project hears often in relation to personal stories about slavery, Norris explains \u2014 \"especially when people go digging.\"", "keywords": ["needed", "family", "black", "familys", "freedom", "explains", "goins", "discovering", "grief", "history", "slavery", "race", "norris", "difficult"], "polarity": -0.13277777777777777, "subjectivity": 0.48400000000000004},

But you couldn't guess that by looking at American journalists, according to a new report by the Women's Media Center.\n\nWomen of color represent just 7.95 percent of U.S. print newsroom staff, 6.2 percent of local radio staff and 12.6 percent of local TV news staff, according to this year's Status of Women in the U.S. Media study, the organization's annual audit of diverse media voices.\n\n\"Women are just 32 percent of newsrooms, but the percentage of women of color is even more dire,\" Cristal Williams Chancellor, director of communications at the Women's Media Center, told NPR. \"We wanted this year's report to take a closer look at that segment.\"\n\nThe report analyzed news organizations' responses to \"professional association queries\" and included dozens of interviews with female journalists of color who shared their obstacles and triumphs.\n\nAlong with American newsrooms' low representations of female journalists of color, the report also found that compared with in previous years, newspapers' count of minority female employees stagnated or fell and radio hired fewer minority women.\n\nWilliams Chancellor said these findings weren't shocking, given the enormous challenges that women of color continue to face in American newsrooms. Especially troublesome, she said, are the media's methods of recruiting, hiring and promotion. \"Part of the challenges come from the plagues that have been part of society for decades, such as racism and sexism, and the old boy's network,\" she told NPR.\n\nAmanda Terkel, Washington bureau chief at the Huffington Post, discussed the nuances of landing a prestigious job in journalism. \"So much of hiring in journalism is poaching from other news outlets, which is often a great way to get talent. But when you do that, you're often dipping from the same pool of people rather than bringing in new voices,\" she said in the report.\n\nThe Women's Media Center recommends that media organizations conduct an audit of their employees, decision-makers and candidates for promotion and that they \"staff with intention.\" The organization also recommended that outlets diversify their news sources.\n\nNPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson was featured in the report and recalled the difficulties she faced as a woman of color during the beginning of her 30-year career as an international reporter. \" 'We want to hire this woman with this foreign-sounding name? How will that work?' \" she remembers hearing. \"Even sources seemed hesitant to call me back, at times. Could they pronounce my name? 'Are you Asian, Middle Eastern? What exactly?' \"\n\nNPR's 377-person news staff is 75.1 percent white, 8.8 percent black, 7.7 percent Asian, 6.1 percent Latino, 2.1 percent multiracial and 0.3 percent American Indian, according to the company's latest report on the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of its newsroom. NPR Ombudsman Elizabeth Jensen called the numbers a \"disappointing showing.\" The newsroom is 56.2 percent female \u2014 the highest number in five years.\n\nLast year's Status of Women in the U.S. Media noted that \"white men were 71 percent of NPR's regular commentators in 2015. By comparison, in 2003, the rate was 60 percent.\" NPR uses the term commentator for its opinion contributors.\n\nThe Women's Media Center hopes that reporting on stagnating hires of female journalists of color will serve as a \"wake-up call\" to the media and its consumers.

People are dumping it in RECORD numbers.\"\n\nThere's evidence that ESPN is not losing subscribers because of its politics. And it is very unusual for a White House to use the bully pulpit to call for the firing of someone at a private company because that person said something it didn't like. (An anti-Trump superPAC has brought an ethics complaint against Sanders, citing federal law that states executive branch employees cannot act \"with the intent to influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity.\")\n\nBut conservatives and some journalists even within the network have been unsettled by what they see as an increasingly liberal bent from the network's commentators without balancing their perspectives.\n\nHill, who plays a dual role of host and commentator, has not been fired or suspended for her tweets. (In other tweets, she called Trump a bigot who is \"unqualified and unfit to be president.\")\n\nThe network said Hill's comments were inappropriate and that it had talked to her. Hill put out a statement via Twitter apologizing \u2014 not for the content of the tweets but for their being seen as a reflection of ESPN.\n\nThe network's public editor, Jim Brady, wrote Friday that he thought the tweets were ill-considered. For those who believe Twitter and the broadcast are separate, Brady points out that ESPN doesn't view it that way. As at other networks, public-facing employees' Twitter feeds are considered reflective of the company they work for. And plenty of people have been fired for inflammatory comments on the medium.\n\nThe irony isn't lost that the president is one person who hasn't been punished for his own incendiary tweets.\n\nLacking \"diversity of thought\"?\n\nBrady sees what happened as a bigger problem at ESPN. \"If you consume as much of ESPN's content as I have for the past 22 months, it seems clear the company leans left,\" he added. \"I don't think anyone ever made an executive decision to go that route as much as the personalities the network has promoted into high-profile positions tend to be more liberal, and as their voices are amplified, the overall voice has shifted with it.\"\n\nESPN veteran Bob Ley, host of the vaunted Outside the Lines program, told Brady in December, when Brady was exploring how ESPN was trying to adapt to current social and political upheaval, \"We've done a great job of diversity. But the one place we have miles to go is diversity of thought.\"\n\nNot too long ago, ESPN was facing criticism for its lack of diversity. There weren't very many female anchors or people of color in front of the camera. And there certainly weren't many black women on the air in prominent positions.\n\nSo the network set out to change that. Hill's show, SC6, also known on the network as The Six, was part of that change. She hosts the show with Michael Smith, a former Boston Globe reporter, who is also black.\n\nThe show is different \u2014 intentionally so. It's not the standard SportsCenter of highlights mixed in with anchor quips. Smith and Hill have a natural chemistry, express their opinions and mix in pop culture. That's what ESPN wanted, and it knew what it was getting with Hill. She's not someone in the traditional journalism mold; she has opinions, writes about them and expresses them on-air sometimes while questioning professional athletes on her program or reacting to what she just heard.\n\nShe has never shied away from sharing her perspectives. And, yes, that includes on race. That has also gotten her in trouble before. ESPN suspended her in 2008 for writing that \"rooting for the Celtics is like saying Hitler was a victim. It's like hoping Gorbachev would get to the blinking red button before Reagan.\"\n\nHill, a Detroit native, wrote of her hatred of Boston: \"Admittedly, to some degree it was about race. Detroit is 80 percent African-American, and as my colleague J.A. Adande stated in a fantastic piece on the Celtics earlier this season, the mostly white Celtics teams of the past had a tough time being accepted by black audiences. Boston was viewed by African-Americans as a racially intolerant city.\"\n\nShe apologized then, writing, \"I let you down. Just because I'm a black woman doesn't mean I've got an automatic sensitivity chip for cultures outside of my own. Just because I've written extensively about race doesn't render me incapable of making the same mistakes as the people I've written about.\"\n\nAlmost a decade later, Hill is in hot water again for expressing a view felt by others, especially African-Americans.\n\nDouble standards\n\nConservatives, though, see the seeming slap on the wrist for Hill in this latest controversy as a double standard. They point to, as one example of ESPN's inconsistency, Curt Schilling. The former Red Sox pitcher was fired last year as an analyst at ESPN for social media comments he made against transgender people.\n\n\"A man is a man no matter what they call themselves,\" Schilling wrote. \"I don't care what they are, who they sleep with, the men's room was designed for penis, women's not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.\"\n\nThat was accompanied by a meme showing an overweight man dressed in women's clothing, a wig and a shirt that showed his chest with the words: \"LET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you're a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.\"\n\nESPN responded in that case by saying it was an \"inclusive company\" and fired Schilling.\n\n\"Let's be very clear about something: Jemele Hill has always been a racist,\" Schilling said Wednesday on Sean Hannity's radio show, \"the things that she says, the things that she does. I don't have a problem with the fact that Jemele Hill is racist, that Bomani Jones is racist, and Colin Kaepernick knelt for a lie, and that Disney and ESPN, who they own, supports liberal racism.\"\n\nSmith, Hill's co-host, sees a different double standard \u2014 that he feels there's a higher bar for a show like theirs that is unafraid to be black, as compared with other white colleagues who have also tried to break the mold in different ways.\n\n\"When Bill Simmons does it, he's celebrated for it,\" Smith told The Ringer. \"When [Scott] Van Pelt does it, he's awesome; he's everyman; we relate to him. When Barstool does it, they're anti-establishment; they're new; they're fresh; they're the anti-ESPN. When we do it? 'Get this black s*** out of here!' That's what it feels like.\"\n\n\"Stick to sports\"\n\nA common refrain from sports fans is that they'd wish the sports people would stick to sports. Hill rejects that idea.\n\n\"When you're under the leadership of a president that refuses to condemn Nazis and racism, how am I supposed to function the rest of the day and pretend as if I give a s*** about Blake Bortles losing his job?\" Hill said during a Sports Illustrated media panel. \"That's the conversation I'm having with myself on a daily basis. I know there are sports fans looking for me to provide them with an 'escape,' but as a woman and person of color, I have no escape from the fact that there are people in charge who seem to be either sickened by my existence or are intent on erasing my dignity in every possible way. So today, my [Twitter] feed is probably a little edgier than it was. It's reflective of all the emotion and conflict I feel. I think others feel the same way.\"\n\nShe also points to coaches, like the San Antonio Spurs' Gregg Popovich, who is white and has been open about his antipathy for Trump, as well as black athletes, who have used their prominence to protest \u2014 from LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick to Muhammad Ali.\n\n\"This idea that sports has always been devoid of politics is a lie,\" Hill says in a video on The Root. \"The same person that will tell me to 'stick to sports' will also say Muhammad Ali was a great sports figure. What's the difference? The difference is now you know Muhammad Ali is right.\"\n\nSupport for Hill in the Trump era\n\nThere's been significant backlash, but believing she's \"right\" is one reason Hill has gotten so much support on social media. Here are just a few tweets, for example, compiled by black-interest magazine Vibe:\n\nThe controversy has spurred supportive columns, tooom:\n\nThe Guardian: \"Is it wrong to call Trump a white supremacist?\"\n\nCosmopolitan: \"Jemele Hill Called Donald Trump a White Supremacist. Where's the Lie?\"\n\nThe Chicago Tribune: \"As Trump seethes over ESPN anchor's tweet, a movement breathes to life.\"\n\nErik Wemple at The Washington Post ran down a list of \"just a few of the examples of our president's refusal to apologize when confronted with his racism and bigotry.\"\n\nAnd Trump himself stepped back into controversy on race this week by doubling down on his Charlottesville comments.\n\n\"I think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One of an anti-fascist movement that has at times resorted to violent tactics against white supremacists. \"And essentially that's what I said.\"\n\nTrump added this defense: \"Now because of what's happened since then, with antifa, you look at, you know, really what's happened since Charlottesville \u2014 a lot of people are saying \u2014 in fact, a lot of people have actually written, 'Gee, Trump might have a point.' I said, 'You got some very bad people on the other side also,' which is true.\"\n\nWhile Trump has condemned white supremacists and the KKK, he has also been criticized for attempting to create a moral equivalency between white-power groups and protest groups on the left.\n\nRemarkably, Trump's latest comments came in response to a question about his meeting with Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate. Scott had been hotly critical of Trump's Charlottesville response and had requested a meeting hoping a one-on-one appeal could bridge a divide with Trump.\n\nThat's where the U.S. is right now \u2013 a country split when it comes to perceptions of race and usually along racial and, increasingly, political lines. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found a majority didn't think Trump's response to Charlottesville was strong enough, but there was a sharp political divide \u2014 almost three-quarters of Democrats thought Trump's response was not strong enough, while a strong majority of Republicans thought it was strong enough.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat partisan divide was equally pronounced when it came to views of race relations more broadly. Again, nearly three-quarters of Democrats thought race relations had worsened in the past year while just a third of Republicans thought so.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe \"post-racial America\" some touted when Obama was elected was always a myth. To become the first black president \u2014 and to be re-elected \u2014 Obama had to walk a delicate line on race. Some black thinkers and writers weren't always happy with him because of that, and conservatives were rankled by his responses to the spate of police shootings of black men in his latter years.\n\nIn a country changing demographically, race relations moved to the front burner during the Obama era \u2014 and the pot boiled over with Trump's election.\n\nJemele Hill is just the latest example.

Gregory (R)/National Geographic\n\nIf National Geographic's April issue was going to be entirely devoted to the subject of race, the magazine decided it had better take a good hard look at its own history.\n\nEditor in Chief Susan Goldberg asked John Edwin Mason, a professor of African history and the history of photography at the University of Virginia, to dive into the magazine's nearly 130-year archive and report back.\n\nWhat Mason found was a long tradition of racism in the magazine's coverage: in its text, its choice of subjects, and in its famed photography.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption National Geographic National Geographic\n\n\"[U]ntil the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers,\" writes Goldberg in the issue's editor letter, where she discusses Mason's findings. \"Meanwhile it pictured 'natives' elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9.\"\n\nUnlike magazines such as Life, \"National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture,\" Goldberg says, noting that she is the first woman and first Jewish person to helm the magazine \u2013 \"two groups that also once faced discrimination here.\"\n\nTo assess the magazine's coverage historically, Mason delved into old issues and read a couple of key critical studies. He also pored over photographers' contact sheets, giving him a view of not just the photos that made it into print, but also the decisions that photographers and editors made.\n\nHe saw a number of problematic themes emerge.\n\n\"The photography, like the articles, didn't simply emphasize difference, but made difference ... very exotic, very strange, and put difference into a hierarchy,\" Mason tells NPR. \"And that hierarchy was very clear: that the West, and especially the English-speaking world, was at the top of the hierarchy. And black and brown people were somewhere underneath.\"\n\nFor much of its history, the pages of National Geographic depicted the Western world as dynamic, forward-moving and very rational. Meanwhile, Mason says, \"the black and brown world was primitive and backwards and generally unchanging.\"\n\nOne trope that he noticed time and again was photographs showing native people apparently fascinated by Westerners' technology.\n\n\"It's not simply that cameras and jeeps and airplanes are present,\" he says. \"It's the people of color looking at this technology in amusement or bewilderment.\" The implication was that Western readers would find humor in such fascination with their everyday goods.\n\nThen there's how the magazine chose its subject matter. Mason explains that National Geographic had an explicit editorial policy of \"nothing unpleasant,\" so readers rarely saw war, famine or civic conflict.\n\nHe points to an article on South Africa from the early 1960s that barely mentions the Sharpeville Massacre, in which 69 black South Africans were killed by police.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kip Ross/National Geographic Creative Kip Ross/National Geographic Creative\n\n\"There are no voices of black South Africans,\" Mason told Goldberg. \"That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances ... servants or workers. It's bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers, and photographers had to consciously not see.\"\n\nThen there's the way women of color were often depicted in the magazine: topless.\n\n\"Teenage boys could always rely, in the '50s and '60s, on National Geographic to show them bare-breasted women as long as the women had brown or black skin,\" Mason says. \"I think the editors understood this was frankly a selling point to its male readers. Some of the bare-breasted young women are shot in a way that almost resembles glamour shots.\"\n\nMason says the magazine has been dealing with its history implicitly for the last two or three decades, but what made this project different is that Goldberg wanted to make reckoning explicit \u2014 \"That National Geographic should not do an issue on race without understanding its own complicity in shaping understandings of race and racial hierarchy.\"\n\ntoggle caption Robert F. Sisson and Donald McBain/National Geographic\n\nFor those of us who have spent long afternoons thumbing old issues of the magazine and dreaming of far-off lands, Mason wants to make clear that looking at foreign people and places isn't a bad thing.\n\n\"We're all curious and we all want to see. I'm not criticizing the idea of being curious about the world. It's just the other messages that are sent\u2014that it's not just difference, but inferiority and superiority.\"\n\nSo where does the storied publication go from here?\n\nOne good step would be to invite the diverse contributors to the April issue to become part of the magazine's regular pool of writers and photographers, Mason suggests.\n\n\"Still it's too often a Westerner who is telling us about Africa or Asia or Latin America,\" he says. \"There are astonishing photographers from all over the world who have unique visions \u2013 not just of their own country, but who could bring a unique vision to photographing Cincinnati, Ohio, if it came to that.\"\n\nHe notes that the magazine's images have so often captivated, even when they were stereotypical or skewed. Mason says a number of African photographers have told him that it was magazines like National Geographic and Life that turned them onto photography in the first place.\n\n\"They knew that there were problems with the way that they and their people were being represented,\" he says. \"And yet the photography was often spectacularly good, it was really inviting, and it carried this power. And as young people, these men and women said, I want to do that. I want to make pictures like that.\"", "keywords": ["coverage", "black", "magazine", "racist", "decades", "mason", "goldberg", "geographic", "reckons", "photographers", "women", "past", "magazines", "national", "world"], "polarity": 0.09568421052631575, "subjectivity": 0.46896009253904014},

Take this one from Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil of Sacramento, Calif.: \"I ate pasta, family ate rice.\"\n\nRamil's parents were Filipino immigrants, and in their household, rice was part of every meal. Her family used so much rice, Ramil says, they couldn't keep it in the cupboard. Instead, the centerpiece of the kitchen was a 4-foot-tall dispenser that held 50 pounds of rice.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\n\"I never knew life without it in my parents' kitchen,\" Ramil says. \"The bottom has a drawer. ... After you press your one, two or three cups, you'd pull the drawer out, and there \u2014 you're ready to make rice in your rice cooker.\n\n\"But my friends would come over and they would ask me what that was and be perplexed by it,\" she says. \"And I was confused right back at them, not knowing why they wouldn't know what a rice dispenser was.\"\n\nGrowing up, Ramil says, she \"wanted to be as non-Filipino as possible and felt great achievement whenever friends said to me, 'You seem so white!' \"\n\nShe was embarrassed when her friends came over and she couldn't offer them pizza, hot dogs or Tater Tots to eat.\n\n\"I just know that growing up, I had moments where I rejected Filipino culture,\" Ramil recalls. So when she reached middle school, Ramil told her parents that she didn't like rice.\n\nRamil's mother didn't object. \"My mom, after rushing home from work to cook dinner for us every day, relented and lovingly prepared pasta for me while the rest of the family ate rice,\" Ramil recalls.\n\n\"I just remember her scrambling in the kitchen. I always remember her coming home from work, still wearing her work clothes, with an apron ... running around making a hot meal every night for our sit-down family dinner,\" Ramil says.\n\n\"And then she would pull out my Pasta Roni box and prepare this processed pasta dish because I claimed not to like rice.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\nHer parents wanted their children to succeed in America, Ramil explains, and were trying to help them assimilate.\n\nNow 31, Ramil cringes a bit when she recounts the story. In fact, she wishes she had spent more time in the kitchen with her mother, learning the family dishes.\n\nShe credits a course she took in college, Filipino American Contemporary Issues, for her change in perspective. \"That dinky little class, that I thought would be nothing ... changed my life and my connection to identity,\" Ramil says.\n\nToday, Ramil's extended family is made up of more than 100 people. Many of her cousins have married non-Filipinos. And now it's Ramil \u2014 who once rejected rice \u2014 who's trying to keep her family's food traditions alive.\n\nShe started with lumpia, which she describes \"as an eggroll, but better.\" Her grandmother, Fausta Reyes Ramil, who lived to be 100, taught Ramil how to make the fried rolls, filled with pork and finely chopped vegetables, before she passed away. (Ramil also has a blog with her grandmother's journal entries, called Lola's Journals.)\n\nNow, Ramil is making sure the young people in her family know how to make the traditional dish.\n\n\"I would prepare my grandmother's lumpia recipe and kind of set up a lumpia sweatshop, if you will,\" Ramil says. \"For each of my cousins' children ... there are about 25 or 30 of them \u2014 I would put a place mat in front of them, lumpia wrappers ... a little bowl of raw meat.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil Courtesy of Melanie Vanderlipe Ramil\n\n\"It's a really neat time, because while they're rolling, I'll bring in my older cousins, my aunts and uncles, and all of them \u2014 they just love it,\" she says. \"We just all talk about stories of my grandmother cooking, our family. ... I just love the tradition.\"\n\nThe irony of being the champion of her family's culinary traditions isn't lost on Ramil. And while her mother didn't resist her request for Pasta Roni all those years ago, Ramil hopes that she'll handle a similar request differently.\n\n\"One day, if I'm a mom, and I hear my daughter say that, I might push back a little \u2014 and I hope I do.\"\n\nDo you have a family food tradition you're trying to preserve?

A larger Confederate flag was painted on another wall.\n\nThe mural was supposed to illustrate a school rivalry, where the men in blue and red represent North Cumberland Elementary and South Cumberland Elementary, respectively.\n\nBut concerned citizens took issue with the Confederate flag and lynching imagery being on the walls of an elementary school.\n\nDavid Clark, a member of the group Shelbyville Loves, an organization that formed as a response to white supremacy in Shelbyville, Tenn., says when a friend sent him pictures of the elementary school mural he knew he had to do something.\n\nClark says he reached out to members of the school board in early December and \"didn't hear anything from them.\" Around Christmas break, he decided to reach out to the superintendent directly.\n\n\"I got a response from her in five minutes,\" he says.\n\nClark says the superintendent told him that they were looking into solutions for the mural and that it would be dealt with in February, once the original artist was available to make changes to it.\n\n\"But February came and went,\" he says, \"and I decided to shine a light on it.\"\n\nClark posted about the Confederate mural on Facebook, and the response was instantaneous, he says. Within 24 hours, the post had garnered 500 likes and about 200 shares. Soon after, the Confederate flags in the mural at South Cumberland Elementary were painted over, as were the straps suspending the man from the tree.

(More on this later.)\n\nOn Saturday, downtown Washington, D.C. was home to three prominent demonstrations that some feared might combine violently but instead stayed largely separate and peaceful, with modest attendance.\n\nThe self-described Mother of All Rallies, designed to support President Trump and \"defend American culture,\" was staged on the National Mall late Saturday morning.\n\nAround the same time and several blocks away, near the White House, was the Protect American Democracy rally, which organizers say was meant to tell the president to take a tougher stance against Russian interference in American elections.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Logan Werlinger for NPR Logan Werlinger for NPR\n\nThe rally garnering the most attention was the Juggalo March, an assembly set near the Lincoln Memorial of so-called Juggalos. The fans of the horror-core rap duo Insane Clown Posse are often adorned in face paint, tattoos and other symbols similar to those of the group. The march was described on its website as \"a collective statement from the Juggalo Family to the world about what we are and what we are not.\"\n\nInsane Clown Posse was founded in 1989, and despite criticism of the group's crude and sometimes violent lyrics, it developed a considerable and dedicated following of Juggalos. (The term derives from a 1992 Insane Clown Posse song, NPR's Tanya Ballard Brown reported.)\n\nIn a 2011 report, the FBI classified Juggalos as a \"loosely organized hybrid gang\" following violent incidents allegedly committed by fans of group. Juggalos, in tandem with the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the government in 2014, claiming Juggalos' \"constitutional rights to expression and association were violated\" by the FBI's classification. The case was dismissed but then later reinstated in September 2015.\n\nAnd, according to the event website for the Juggalo March, the case has been thrown out for a second time, \"meaning we are back to square one from a legal standpoint,\" the group says.\n\nThe case was dismissed both times by the same Michigan judge who said the Juggalos lacked \"legal standing,\" The Guardian reports. The fan base will now have to wait at least six months for a ruling on the ACLU's second appeal, the newspaper adds.\n\nThe Juggalos say the gang label has, through unfair discrimination, made it difficult to live a normal life for many of their members, some of whom were scheduled to speak on Saturday as part of the effort to express their anger with the FBI.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n\n\"We are taking out [sic] fight to the streets.

The rally's organizers wrote on their website that Confederate flags and racism would not be allowed, clearly hoping to distinguish their event from the march of white supremacists that turned deadly last month in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nNevertheless, as NPR's Windsor Johnston reported, some counterprotesters attempted to tie the MOAR rally to Charlottesville, including one who held a sign featuring an image of the woman killed by a motorist there.\n\nOfficials kept the protesters far from one another, which, along with a heavy police presence, appeared to keep the Saturday events peaceful, reported WAMU's Sasha-Ann Simons.", "keywords": ["logan", "image", "caption", "plus", "washington", "political", "typical", "rallies", "dc", "werlinger", "posse", "clown", "american", "juggalos", "juggalo"], "polarity": -0.04099714839151458, "subjectivity": 0.409023370995202},

For decades after that conflict, Carter flew numerous transport missions in other war zones, including Vietnam.\n\n\"We mourn the loss of a true American Hero,\" the NYPD's 47th Precinct said in a tweet on Sunday. After summarizing his decorated career, the precinct added, \"Our Community & Nation has lost a giant.\"\n\nAfter he became a police officer in 1953, Carter quickly rose to the rank of detective; he retired from the NYPD in 1980. The flag outside the precinct house in the Bronx was flown at half-staff in Carter's honor.\n\nThe New York Daily News reports:\n\n\"His NYPD duties included work as a bodyguard for visiting heads of state, and Carter spent time with Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Soviet head Nikita Khrushchev, recalled his son Floyd Jr. \"He earned a half-dozen citations for his outstanding police work, and survived a number of shootouts with armed bandits.\"\n\nCarter retired from the U.S. Air Force Reserves in the early 1970s as a lieutenant colonel, having served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. In the final years of his more than 30-year career, he made history again as \"the first African American commander of a heavy jet transport squadron,\" as Flying magazine reported in 2009.\n\nIn an interview for that article in Flying, Carter spoke about the discrimination he and his fellow cadets faced during their training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama.

In some cases, Norris tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep, people say it feels accusatory \u2014 like, 'Do you really belong?'\n\nIt's also a question that Alex Sugiura, because of his racially ambiguous appearance, can't seem to escape.\n\nSugiura, 27, is the child of a first-generation Japanese immigrant father and a Jewish mother of Eastern European descent. Sugiura's brother Max looks more identifiably Asian, but when people meet Alex, they're often not satisfied to hear that he's from Brooklyn.\n\nSome people find this question accusatory, as if the person being asked doesn't quite belong. But Sugiura actually welcomes the question and the conversations that flow out of it \u2014 and he says he understands why people ask.\n\n\"I have always thought I've had a particularly strange face,\" he explains. \"I looked at my parents growing up and I didn't see their faces in my face \u2014 I did see some combination, some mixture.\" When he looked in the mirror, he says, he didn't see a \"typical American face.\"\n\nThat may be so, but Sugiura's face, along with his brother Max and other adults and children of mixed race, was recently highlighted in the October issue of National Geographic. \"The Changing Face of America\" examines the nation's growing number of multiracial people and how they choose to identify themselves.\n\nWhen Sugiura fills out question about race in the census form, he checks the box for Japanese.

It first happened when he was 6 or 7 years old, when someone began asking him questions in Spanish. \"And at that point, I had no faculty for the language and almost started crying cause I was just so terrified,\" he says.\n\nBut by age 11 he started to take Spanish classes. And while he'd already been taking Japanese language and cultural classes for years, he found he enjoyed Spanish much more.\n\n\"It was a passing fancy at first, this idea [that] by people jokingly or mistakenly identifying me as Hispanic. ... I thought there was some kind of safe space there, you might say \u2014 that I was given a kind of fictional persona,\" Sugiura says. \"I would say it propelled me forward and I feel very much like my own man through the Spanish language.\"\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of the Sugiura Family\n\nThere's another interesting wrinkle in Sugiura's thoughts on the intersection of race and appearance, Norris says, noting that this particularly sensitive subject was a bit tough for Sugiura to talk about. \"He says that his height, his deep voice, his Type A personality, his sort of, big physical presence, has helped him sidestep ... some of the more painful, offensive stereotypes that are too often attached to Asian men.\"\n\nSugiura bristles at those stereotypes, and yet, he notes that his father \"did us a great favor by marrying our mother. ... They made two tall, loud boys.\"\n\n\"When you're a typical, you know, shorter, soft-spoken Asian male, you are perceived almost to be weaker or lacking the fiber of what an American leader is supposed to be,\" he says.\n\nThe Sugiura family's appearance raises questions in the American South 1:46\n\nSugiura says this all goes back to the reason that he welcomes this question, \"Where are you really from?\" He sees that question as an opening to make the point that there are many different ways to be Asian, Jewish, white or even a New Yorker. \"And he has a chance to make that point,\" Norris explains, \"if he actually gets to participate in those conversations.\"\n\nAnd, Sugiura notes, this question about where you come from can lead to some very unexpected conversations \u2014 like one his family experienced on a stop at a gas station in the American South. An older white man behind the counter asked his father, \"Where are you from, boy?\"\n\nAnd while the question felt laden with tension, the outcome of the encounter surprised everyone.

How about a $30 lunch? That's the premise behind a social experiment playing out in a New Orleans food stall.\n\nChef Tunde Way opened his pop-up stall in the city's Roux Carre venue in early February. The listed price for the Nigerian food is $12. But when white people walk up to order, they are asked whether they want to pay $30. Why? \"It's two-and-a half times more than the $12 meal, which reflects the income disparity\" between whites and African-Americans in New Orleans, says Wey.\n\nThe median income for African-American households in New Orleans fell from $32,332 in 2000 to $27,812 in 2013 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to The Data Center's New Orleans Index at Ten. Over the same time, median income for white households in the city remained roughly the same, $61,117 to $60,070. In 2013, the median household income for African-Americans in metro New Orleans was 54 percent lower than for whites.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Deji Osinulu Deji Osinulu\n\nWey says that when customers come up to his window to place an order, he tells them that his food stall aims to engage people on the topic of racial income and wealth disparities and to share statistics on these disparities. He then informs them that customers who identify as white are being asked to pay the higher $30 price to reflect these disparities. Customers also have the option to pay the listed $12 price. The difference between the $12 and $30 meals, all customers are informed, will be redistributed to minorities who buy food at the stall. How do white customers react to the proposition?\n\n\"Some of them are enthusiastic, some of them are bamboozled a bit by it,\" Wey says. \"But the majority of white folks, nearly 80 percent, decided to pay.\"\n\n\"That was definitely higher than we expected,\" says Anjali Prasertong, a graduate student in public health at Tulane University who helped Wey design the experiment and collect data.\n\nCustomers who agree to buy lunch were asked to fill out a brief survey online. A subset of these diners were also pulled aside and interviewed about how income and wealth disparities have played out in their own lives.\n\nPrasertong points to one anecdote from an African-American customer whom she interviewed. \"I asked her, 'If you had been given access to more resources while you were growing up, would that have changed your life in any way?' \" Prasertong recalls. \"She immediately had an example.\"\n\nThe woman told Prasertong that when she was a college student, she was offered an unpaid summer White House internship in Washington, D.C. But that meant she would have had to find a way to support herself in another city instead of spending the summer earning money that she could use to help pay for school in the fall. The woman passed on the internship, Prasertong says, because \"she realized, 'Oh, it's just for rich people' \" \u2013 meaning students whose parents could afford to subsidize them while they worked for free. \"She still went on to be successful, but if she'd done that internship, who knows what she'd be doing?\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Deji Osinulu Deji Osinulu\n\n\"One of the things I took away from interviewing people was a greater awareness that people of color have thought about wealth disparity and how it has touched their lives and the kinds of things they've lost out on because they didn't have access to the resources their white friends did,\" says Prasertong. \"Not that [white people] weren't aware, but they never really thought about how ... that might have affected where they are in the world in relation to people of color. They never stopped to think, 'Oh, that car my parents gave me in college allowed me to drive across town to get a good job.' \"\n\nAs Prasertong points out, \"It's not a strict scientific study.\" One limitation of this experiment is that the customers who came to the stall were all in a higher-than-average income bracket. Prasertong says that may be one reason why the vast majority of customers of color \u2013 African-Americans, Latinos and Asians \u2013 declined to sign up to receive the redistributed money made from charging whites the higher price.\n\nAs of Feb. 28, the day the premise of the experiment was revealed in a Times-Picayune article, 64 people had completed the survey, which included 32 whites, Prasertong says. Twenty-five white customers paid the extra $18, adding up to a pool of $450. Only six people of color had signed up for distributions, which they would split evenly among them, $75 each.\n\nThe food stall \u2014 called Saartj, a reference to a 19th-century black South African woman infamously paraded as a \"freak show\" in Europe \u2014 will be open through Sunday, though the data collection part of the experiment is now over.\n\nWhile this experiment focused on racial income disparity in New Orleans, the numbers when it comes to the racial wealth gap in America are even starker. White families accumulate more wealth more quickly than do families made up of people of color. As NPR's Code Switch team has reported:\n\n\"In 2013, the median white family held 13 times as much net wealth as the median black family and 10 times as much wealth as the median Latino family, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.\"\n\nThere are many reasons cited behind this gap, including slavery and institutional and governmental discrimination that excluded people of color from programs that helped Americans build wealth and pass it down through the generations. As Code Switch writes: \"Segregation and redlining by banks made it impossible for many black and Latino families to secure mortgages, for example. The GI Bill, which helped establish an American middle class by helping veterans pay for college and buy homes after World War II, mostly excluded people of color.\"\n\nOne goal of his experiment, says Wey, is to get people to think about how the racial wealth and income gaps affect their own lives and also how they can as individuals be a force for change.\n\n\"We think of this as a systemic issue, like something that happens outside of ourselves, when in fact the aggregate sum of all of our actions and choices exacerbates or ameliorates the wealth gap,\" says Wey. That includes actions like \"where we choose to send our children to school, where we choose to buy a home and critically, how we choose to spend our money and where we choose to spend our money. \"", "keywords": ["white", "pay", "asked", "food", "serves", "median", "orleans", "wealth", "stall", "income", "experiment", "social", "customers", "prasertong"], "polarity": 0.11559855309855309, "subjectivity": 0.3765697515697516},

But this fall he received a letter from his insurer explaining that the cost of his policy's premium would jump from $800 a month to $1,300 in 2018.\n\nPremiums have risen for many 2018 policies, though most people won't actually have to swallow those higher costs, because subsidies have gone up, too. Gene Kern is one of the exceptions.\n\n\"Because of my income, I am slightly above the 400 percent poverty level,\" he says, \"and as a result I get no subsidy from the government.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Selena Simmons-Duffin / WAMU Selena Simmons-Duffin / WAMU\n\nSo Kern has switched to an HMO plan on the insurance exchange for around $900 a month. That's more than 20 percent of his income, which comes partly from Social Security and partly from his retirement account. But, he says, \"It's the best I can get,\" and he wants very much to stay insured for the next two years, at which point he will qualify for Medicare.\n\nLouise Norris is a health insurance broker and analyst in Colorado. She says there are a number of people like Kern who earn too much for a subsidy and will pay more for health insurance next year than they did in 2017. \"Rates are high,\" she says. \"There's no way to sugarcoat that.\"\n\nBut she warns her clients against the temptation to get a less expensive plan that doesn't comply with the minimum standards set out by the ACA.\n\n\"It seems like a good deal because it's cheap,\" Norris says. \"But then you find yourself being that person who has a heart attack and needs triple bypass. And hundreds of thousands of dollars later you wish you had that ACA-compliant plan.\"\n\nPrices for ACA-compliant health policies went up in Tennessee, too, where state regulators approved average rate increases ranging from 20 to 40 percent.\n\nBrenda Linn has already been paying $750 a month just to cover her own medical needs; so the retired kindergarten teacher and her husband logged on to HealthCare.gov to check the price of 2018 plans. To her surprise, the website brought up a great deal.\n\n\"And I'm like, 'Dave, this has to be a mistake,' \" she says. The price Linn was quoted was less than $5 a month. Why? A slight loss of income had made her eligible for a subsidy for 2018. \"Because we didn't qualify last year, I wasn't really that hopeful,\" Linn says.\n\nBut a large majority of marketplace shoppers do get subsidies. And for 2018, on aggregate, these subsidies are larger.\n\nTony Garr, a volunteer application assistant with the Tennessee Health Care Campaign, says more than ever this year, people should shop around on the exchange to see what kind of subsidies they may be eligible for.\n\n\"Generally speaking, they will find out that help is there,\" he says.\n\nAny many people who got a price break in the way of a subsidy in the past can get even more for their money this year.\n\nFor example, Daniel Prestwood, who is self-employed and cleans fish tanks around Nashville, says he found a better plan for 2018, with monthly premiums that dropped from $300 to $200. He says he tries not to get too frustrated by the political wrangling over health care.\n\n\"All I know is that for 2018 I'll have a good health care plan in place,\" he says, \"and that's the best I can hope for at this point.\"\n\nAnd even with the Trump administration's efforts to hobble the ACA, in Tennessee, the number of applications processed by federally funded insurance guides \u2014 known as navigators and certified application counselors \u2014 has already surpassed last year's. As of early last week, with 10 days left in open enrollment, more than 1,200 individuals had applied with official help, eclipsing the total from all of 2016, when the enrollment period was several weeks longer.\n\nWhile application assistants only work with a tiny fraction of the 235,000 Tennesseans who have marketplace plans, Sandy Dimick of Family and Children's Services Nashville, says she expects total enrollment will exceed last year's total, as well. Navigators around the U.S. have worried that cuts to the federal advertising budget in 2017, and a lack of cheerleading from the White House, could drive down enrollment.\n\nTake note: Though enrollment for most states ends Friday night, residents of nine states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Washington) and the District of Columbia have slightly more time to sign up.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with local member stations and Kaiser Health News.

When I arrived it was just after dark and I noticed few signs of life as I drove past the scattered homes, scanning for disheartened crossers. In the center of the village a small adobe church stood in an empty dirt lot, and I saw that the front door had been left ajar. I parked the van and left the headlights shining on the entrance. I walked to the heavy wooden door and leaned with all my weight to push it open, causing a loud and violent scraping to rise up and echo into the dim interior.\n\nInside the church, the light from my flashlight glinted off tiny strings of tinsel hanging from the ceiling. A large piece of fabric depicting the Virgin of Guadalupe was strung across the front wall, and beneath it I saw two figures lying on a blanket that had been spread out between the pews and the altar. As I approached, a man looked up at me and squinted, holding out his hand to block the light. We were resting a little, he said. It's just that we are lost, muy desanimados. A woman huddled close to him, hiding her face. The man propped himself up on one elbow and told me that they had crossed four days ago, that their guide had left them behind on the first night when they'd failed to keep pace with the group. They were lost for days, he said, with nothing to drink but the filthy water from cattle tanks. Puede ser muy fea la frontera, I told him. The man shook his head. Pues s\u00ed, he replied, pero es a\u00fan m\u00e1s feo donde nosotros vivimos.\n\nThe man told me that they came from Morelos. My wife and I, we're just coming to find work, he said. He rubbed his eyes in silence. I have fresh water for you, I told them. At the station there's juice and crackers. The man looked at me and smiled weakly, then asked for a minute to gather their belongings. He stuffed some things into a backpack, then helped his wife to her feet. Her face was streaked with dried tears, and when she turned toward me I saw that she was pregnant. How many months are you? I asked. The woman looked away and the man answered for her. Seis meses. He smiled. My wife speaks perfect English, he said, shouldering the backpack. He stopped in front of the altar, bowing his head and making the sign of the cross. I waited at the door as he mumbled a prayer. Gracias, he whispered. Gracias.\n\nOutside I looked at their faces in the glare of my headlights. The woman seemed young. Where did you learn English? I asked. Iowa, she told me quietly. I grew up there, she said, I even got my GED. She kept her head down and avoided my gaze as she talked, glancing up only briefly at my uniformed body. Why did you leave? I asked her. She told me that she had returned to Morelos to care for her younger siblings after their mother died. In Morelos I made some money teaching English at the kindergarten, she said, I even tutored the adults in my village, people preparing for the journey north. For a few seconds she seemed proud, and then she shook her head. But the money there, it isn't enough. She glanced up at her husband. It was my idea to cross, she said. I wanted our child to have a life here, like I did.\n\nThe man took a moment to look at me in the light. Listen, he said, do you think you could bring us back to Mexico, como hermano? You could drive us down to the border, he pleaded, you could just leave us there, all\u00ed en la l\u00ednea. Like a brother. I sighed and turned my head, squinting at the darkness beyond the church. I have to bring you in, I told him. It's my job. The man took a deep breath and nodded and then climbed into the back of the transport van, holding out his arms to help his pregnant wife.\n\nI gestured at a case of water bottles on the floor. You should drink, I told them. I grabbed the metal door of the cage and paused. What are your names? I asked. The man looked at me strangely and glanced at his wife. Then, as if it were nothing, they took turns introducing themselves. I repeated their names and I told them mine. Mucho gusto, I said. They replied with polite smiles. Igualmente. I turned my head and then bolted the cage and shut the door.\n\nIn the driver's seat I turned to look at the couple through the plexiglass. The man held his wife and gently whispered to her, cradling her head. Just before I started the engine I could hear the soft sound of her sobbing. As I drove through the unmarked streets of the village, trying to find my way to the highway, I felt for a moment that I had become lost. Beyond the last house, I saw a white dog in the darkness at the edge of my headlights, staring into the night.\n\nAt the station, I sorted through their things with them, discarding perishables and sharp objects. I had them remove their belts and their shoelaces and I tagged their backpacks and handed them a claim ticket. I counted and took note of their money, in pesos and in dollars, and then handed it back to them, telling them to keep it close. Inside the processing center I filled out their voluntary return papers and entered their names into the computer. Before leaving them in their cell I wished them luck on their journey and asked them to be safe, to always think of their child.\n\nLater that night, as I sat in the transport van listening to the calls come out over the radio, I realized I had forgotten their names.", "keywords": ["wife", "looked", "line", "asked", "told", "river", "head", "turned", "man", "took", "village", "van"], "polarity": 0.03761123136123136, "subjectivity": 0.3734547859547859},

She talks with NPR's Renee Montagne.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nJust after the shooting that took 17 lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., senior Demetri Hoth was among the students there who took action. Here he is on CNN.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDEMETRI HOTH: We just really want the lawmakers to understand the type of things that we went through by showing them that we're a united front and that we're not going to back down until change actually happens.\n\nMONTAGNE: Now, almost four weeks later, that change is actually beginning to happen. In a move that amounted to a break with his longtime allies at the National Rifle Association, Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott signed into law new regulations on guns. The bipartisan bill, named for the Parkland school that inspired it, bans bump stocks, increases waiting periods, raises the buyer age limit to 21 and broadens the power of police to seize weapons. Governor Scott also called for more police officers in schools to protect students, but armed officers in schools are nothing new. And for students of color, it doesn't make school feel safer.\n\nKAILA CAFFEY: Unfortunately, students of color are often targeted by police officers and tend to be victims of police violence.\n\nMONTAGNE: Kaila Caffey is a senior at Central High School in Philadelphia. She says the issue got her attention when footage surfaced in 2016 of an officer restraining a student at a nearby school.\n\nCAFFEY: He was put into a chokehold while attempting to use the bathroom without a hall pass.\n\nMONTAGNE: Caffey is a member of the Philadelphia Student Union, PSU, which is advocating to remove police from schools. She and her fellow students are just as proactive as the students in Parkland. And though she's supportive of them, she says there's a difference in how the demands from the two groups are being received.\n\nCAFFEY: As a woman of color and with PSU being a predominantly black organization, even in trying to make changes in our own district, we've received a lot of pushback.\n\nMONTAGNE: The Philadelphia Student Union is forging ahead with a school walkout.\n\nCAFFEY: The message that we're hoping to send is that our experience is very different. Students experience violence on a day-to-day basis in their schools. What they're doing now is not helping anybody. In fact, it's harming more students.\n\nMONTAGNE: Student groups from two dozen schools in the Philadelphia area are signed up to participate in that walkout this coming Wednesday.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition.\n\nAgain and again, The Race Card Project receives submissions dealing with mixed-race identity; from a child of a mixed-race union, from a parent of mixed-race children or from someone who is trying to figure out how to identify a mixed-race student or colleague, for example.\n\nThose kinds of stories are the largest single category of six-word submissions the Race Card Project receives, says Michele Norris, who curates the project. Many of these entries have a lot to do with labels and identity.\n\nWilma Stordahl, a Seattle resident who's an account manager for a national landscape company, offered one such submission: \"Norwegian with Nappy Hair Doesn't Fit.\"\n\n'What Are They?'\n\nStordahl is Norwegian, and she and her husband are both white. Together they have a 15-year-old white son, but she also has two older sons, Kevin Stordahl, 25, and Kazon Stordahl, 19, who both have a black father.\n\nWilma Stordahl gave them her last name in part because she wanted to make sure they had had a very specific and highly identifiable link to her family heritage.\n\n\"Typically, we think of Norwegians as being tall and blond and blue-eyed,\" Stordahl says. \"And my sons are tall \u2014 but they're not blond and blue-eyed.\"\n\nWhen the boys travel around with their tall, blonde mother, Stordahl says they draw quizzical stares and even questions from strangers.\n\n\"They'll usually lean in and quietly say, 'What are they?' And what they really want to ask is, 'What race are they?' \"\n\nStordahl typically answers with \"handsome,\" but she knows it's also more complicated than her tongue-in-cheek answer.\n\n\"In my 20s, I wanted to call them mixed-race. I wanted to say that they were some other thing, some other category than what was listed on all the forms that you fill out,\" Stordahl explains. \"But I was repeatedly corrected, and actually, I was most frequently corrected by African Americans.\"\n\nThey would tell her, \" 'No, honey \u2014 your son is black,' \" she says. \"Like, just get used to it, because that's how the world's gonna see them.\"\n\nStordahl did get used to those conversations, but she also wishes that people would move away from what she considers instinctive labeling of people based just on skin color or appearance \u2014 especially as more children are born of mixed-race couplings.\n\nNot Mixed-Race, But Mixed-Heritage\n\nWhen her son Kazon is asked these kinds of questions, he prefers to answer that he's mixed-race and leave it at that, Stordahl explains. But Kevin, she says, rejects that label for something more precise; he prefers the term \"mixed-heritage.\"\n\n\"He is rebelling against that idea that he's not just black and he's not just white,\" Stordahl says. \"He's of mixed-heritage. There's all these other customs and traits and things like that that also come with heritage.\"\n\nKevin, a sociology major who wants to focus on the study of mixed-race identity, has also taken a keen interest in his Norwegian background, pursuing Scandinavian studies in college and studying Norwegian.\n\nHis mother is thrilled, but she also has some concerns. \"There's another part of me that has a little bit of maybe guilt, that perhaps if it wasn't that he was of mixed-heritage, that perhaps he would be spending his time pursing something that would produce a more lucrative career,\" she says.\n\n\"I worry that perhaps he's ended up spending all of his energy and time and tuition on this question of identity \u2014 and maybe that he's searching for something within himself.\"\n\nBut, she says, Kevin assures her this is the path that makes him happy, \"so I'm gonna leave it at that.\"\n\nStordahl knows that when people look at her tall, brown-skinned boys \u2014 now young men \u2014 that they might not immediately recognize their Norwegian heritage. That makes her sad, but she also knows that if people take the time to really look hard at them, the Stordahl family is there, in their height and in their faces.\n\n\"I often have joked that my sons don't look a whole lot like me,\" Stordahl says. \"But in fact ... we all have the same eyes. Not the color, but the shape. They're all tall, like me \u2014 they're actually taller than me now.\n\n\"They are a part of me, and I a part of them.

But black and other non-white cosplayers often feel excluded because non-white characters are rarely featured prominently in the fantasy worlds of comics. They are often relegated to the roles of sidekicks or villains rather than the superheroes.\n\nBut Black Panther, which features a black lead and a predominantly black cast, offers a multifaceted depiction of African life where people of color play both the villains and the heroes. These characters are transforming the playing field for non-white cosplayers like Tamara Heredia, a black cosplayer from Houston, Texas.\n\n\"Black Panther, the movie itself, was such a big deal for me simply because I had never seen powerful black women portrayed like anywhere really,\" she tells Here & Now's Robin Young. \"So to see them be like the head, the leaders, of Wakanda was really really powerful for me.\"\n\nOthers say that Black Panther is helping create a more inclusive world both within the cosplay community and outside of it.\n\n\"We're helping people see us as heroes,\" Portia Lewis, an African-American cosplayer who lives in Los Angeles, told The New York Times. \"And I think black cosplayers are changing cosplay because we are now opening up a conversation about inclusion. We're a subculture within a subculture, and we're hoping the nerd community can be more inclusive toward us.\"\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy Tamara Heredia\n\nBlack cosplayers often face criticism and ridicule for portraying white characters. But if they want to participate in cosplay, they don't have much of a choice. An annual report on Hollywood diversity found that while people of color make up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population, they are grossly underrepresented across the industry.\n\n\"I have cosplayed non-black characters and heard the ridicule like, 'Oh well, you're black Power Girl.' No, I'm just Power Girl,\" Heredia says. \"Or, 'Oh you're a black Wonder Woman.' No, just Wonder Woman.\"\n\nThis sentiment of isolation among many non-white cosplayers is further felt online when they interact with the thousands of cosplayers who are overwhelmingly white, Heredia says.\n\n\"I don't know how many times we'll go into a thread and be like, 'Hey, I'm really looking for ideas on what I should cosplay,' and it's nothing but only black characters because it's what we look like,\" she says.\n\nMany cosplayers of color have created Facebook and Instagram groups to come together in celebration of black cosplay, The New York Times notes:\n\n\"The goal, many cosplayers interviewed said, is to disrupt popular ideas of what cosplay can and should look like and to help create a more racially tolerant environment through cosplay, both in Black Panther costumes and outside of them.\"\n\nJournalist Jesse J. Holland, who wrote the accompanying novel Who Is The Black Panther?, told Here & Now's Lisa Mullins last month that the movie represents the larger trend of Hollywood trying to diversify, which as evidenced by black cosplayers, is permeating into other parts of the entertainment industry.\n\n\"I think not only are they going to be entertainment on the screens,\" he says, \"but they'll also be used as icons, as symbols of the way this country is diversifying, and about how we see ourselves as a country.\"", "keywords": ["black", "characters", "heredia", "really", "nonwhite", "brings", "cosplay", "color", "panther", "times", "country", "cosplayers", "visibility"], "polarity": 0.07380254154447702, "subjectivity": 0.43635665409858965},

But the state's political history is littered with episodes mixing sex and power in unseemly ways.\n\nOne of the first notable cases is John Winston. The former state senator was elected governor in 1853, six years after killing a doctor who was his wife's lover, in a duel. More recently, Gov. Robert Bentley resigned in April 2017 after a sex scandal and cover-up attempt involving one of his aides.\n\nBut one of the most notable politicians to face a scandal that rivals Moore's is \"Big Jim\" Folsom, a former Democratic governor who served two non-consecutive terms in the 1940s and 50s.\n\nRetail politics played a major role in Folsom's career, as it does in Moore's. Folsom toured the state with a hillbilly band called the \"Strawberry Pickers\" and brought a mop and bucket on stage to let voters know that if elected, he would \"clean out the capitol.\" He later collected donations in the bucket.\n\nIn a move reminiscent of Moore's appeal to evangelical voters, Folsom commissioned a campaign ballad with the lyrics: \"What do you, pray? Big Jim Folsom's gonna be governor again!\"\n\nWhile Moore has strenuously denied the charges against him, Folsom completely embraced being called a womanizer.\n\nIn the press, Folsom became known as \"Kissing Jim\" in part because of a publicity stunt in 1948 when he kissed 100 models in New York City who had voted him \"The Nation's Number One Leap Year Bachelor.\" The event attracted 2,500 onlookers and caused a traffic jam.\n\nAmong Folsom's other claims was that he had kissed \"50,000 of the sweetest mouths in Dixie\" and that he had \"started with the 16-year-old ones and worked up from there.\"\n\nIn yet another memorable instance, Folsom is said to have complained that his opponents were setting political traps for him. \"If they bait a hook with whiskey and women, they'll catch Big Jim every time.\"\n\nThe scandal that threatened to derail his political career came in the second year of his first term. A former hotel cashier from Birmingham filed a paternity suit claiming that Folsom was the father of her son. Nine days later, Folsom staged the kissing event in New York City and then he got married, which helped to silence his critics and settled the lawsuit.\n\nThen Folsom did something that would seemingly kill any political career and admitted he was the father of the cashier's son. Pundits wondered if Folsom would win re-election the next time he was eligible (consecutive terms in Alabama weren't allowed at the time).\n\nBut to everyone's surprise, at least to everyone who didn't live in Alabama, Folsom was easily elected to a second term in 1954. Why? Political commentator Steve Flowers points to the same reason that Roy Moore may win: Alabamians hate being told how they should vote by anyone who doesn't live in the state.\n\nHistorian Wayne Flynt points to the state motto, \"We Dare Defend Our Rights\" and argues it's baked into the consciousness of the state's citizens, especially when Alabamians are mocked for being \"backwards.\"\n\ntoggle caption Alabama Department of Archives and History\n\n\"If sophisticated, better educated cultures that are less evangelical make fun of you and your people you react with a 'bunker mentality,\" says Flynt.\n\nWhen it comes to issues of sexual morality, Flynt argues Alabamians are actually of two minds.\n\n\"On one hand we celebrate the virgin and on the other we celebrate the floozy. We celebrate the saint and we celebrate the 'hell of a good fella,'\" which includes people like Folsom.\n\nFolsom's third bid for governor in 1962 ended with a loss to yet-another populist politician, George Wallace. Folsom's defeat was said to be due to a disastrous appearance on television in which he appeared to be drunk. Folsom later claimed that he had been drugged.\n\nAlthough Big Jim's career faded after that election, his son, Jim Folsom, Jr., went on to become a force in state politics and was elected twice as lieutenant governor. \"Little Jim,\" as he is known, became governor in 1993 after the incumbent resigned due to a corruption scandal and served in that post for nearly two years.", "keywords": ["governor", "moore", "folsom", "roy", "kissing", "elected", "state", "grappled", "alabama", "political", "jim", "folsoms", "scandal"], "polarity": 0.0964886964886965, "subjectivity": 0.3756734006734007},

My mother worked an office job, and had to juggle her career, finishing her degree and raising two young children. With both parents working full time, this left my brother and me in a bit of a free-fall.\n\nBut when I was around four, help arrived. My aunt Nena moved from Mexico to the U.S. \u2014 the plan was for her to live with our family and take care of my brother and me while settling into life in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the time, it seemed like a wonderful idea. My aunt would help with childcare while teaching us Spanish. What no one anticipated was her own eagerness to learn English, essential for her transition to the U.S. And who better to learn from than two native English speakers?\n\nThis resulted, much to everyone's chagrin, in two stubbornly Anglophone children. I can't speak Spanish. It's a simple fact that fills me with shame.\n\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that my situation reflects a question in the broader Latinx community: Just how important is knowing how to speak Spanish, anyway?\n\nThe answer, even among the Latinx community, is complicated. A Pew Research Center study from October of 2017, found that \"while the number of Latinos who speak Spanish at home continues to increase due to the overall growth of the Latino population, the share of Latinos who speak the language has declined over the past decade.\"\n\nIn other words: While the population is growing, a smaller percentage of us are speaking the language. In 2006, 78 percent of Latinxs spoke Spanish at home. By 2015, that number had dropped to 73 percent.\n\nI'm part of that decline. Living in a city with nearly 5 million Latinxs provided me with countless opportunities to engage my culture. I have fond childhood memories of outings to Olvera Street, weekly trips to the local panader\u00eda, and dance lessons in ballet folkl\u00f3rico.\n\nI'm proud of my culture. But despite all this, I struggle with my Mexican identity.\n\nGrowing up, I was told that understanding the language of the home country was of the utmost importance. Sometimes this message was subtle: Spanish-speaking strangers who, after trying and failing to interact with me, would let out a pointed \"\u00bfNo habla espa\u00f1ol?\"\n\nLatinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language 11:40\n\nOther times, it was more explicit \u2014 the gentle (and not-so-gentle) teasing from family and friends for mixing up ser and estar; the uncomfortable silence that fell between my cousins and me, neither of us able to communicate during my family's trips to Mexico.\n\nThis disconnect between language and culture is all too common for Latinx Americans. According to Pew, 71 percent of self-identified Hispanic adults said that you don't need to speak Spanish to be considered Latinx. At the same time, nearly 90 percent say that it's important for future generations of Latinx Americans to speak Spanish.\n\nLanguage is central to just about every cultural identity. And language, particularly for Hispanics, transcends national borders. We have a word for this: Latinidad. It's an understanding that Latin American communities are varied and complex, but connected by a shared language.\n\nFor me, this understanding played out on a personal level. In school, my friends were Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican and Salvadoran. We didn't necessarily share a common experience. But Spanish was supposed to be a way we could understand one another despite our different backgrounds.\n\nThis perceived understanding explains the warmth and affection I receive from Hispanic strangers I meet in public. It also accounts for their visible disappointment when I reveal the extent of my American assimilation. Growing up, it didn't matter to my friends or to strangers that I could make tamales or sing my heart out to Selena's Como La Flor (albeit with a bit of stumbling through the lyrics).\n\nIn the view of many of my Hispanic compatriots, I wasn't Mexican-American. I was just American.\n\nMark Hugo Lopez is the Director of Hispanic Research at Pew. He's the researcher who found that a declining proportion of Latinxs speak Spanish. Lopez says that when he talks to Latinxs about how they identify, language often becomes the focal point.\n\n\"A lot of Latinos will say it's important that future generations of Hispanics in the U.S. speak Spanish,\" Lopez says. But, he adds, \"the proof is in the pudding. How many of them actually do? ... There's a lot of tension here about what people want and what actually happens.\"\n\nThat tension exists for good reason. Language is so important because it's \"how we experience the world,\" says Amelia Tseng. She's a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution and a scholar in residence at American University, where she studies multilingualism and identity. \"We live our lives in language.\"\n\nTseng says that's part of why so many people, consciously or not, think of American identity and speaking English as inextricably linked.\n\nAnd it's probably why I have such complicated feelings about being a Mexican-American who can't speak Spanish.\n\nThis feeling, called \"language insecurity\" in the academic community, is especially common among second-generation Latinxs in the U.S., according to Tseng.\n\n\"They kind of feel like they can never win,\" she explains. \"They're just very aware that any moment they could be told, 'You're not doing it right,' and there's sort of a challenge to that part of their identity.\"\n\nDespite this insecurity, Tseng stresses that growing up monolingual, like I did, isn't anyone's fault. For second- and third-generation Latinx Americans, retaining Spanish \"isn't a question of how much you want to keep it. It's a question of how much opportunity you have to keep it.\"\n\nTseng says there are barriers to bilingualism that are often outside of our control: social pressure, stigmatization and discrimination.\n\nUltimately, Tseng adds, it's important for Latinxs to grapple with these sentiments openly. \"It helps people understand themselves and where they come from better. And then they can also make more informed choices about what they want to do.\"\n\nSome people may not want to learn Spanish. \"That's OK,\" she says. \"Let's celebrate all identities, and not just the ones we think are correct.\"\n\nI'm not sure if I'll ever be comfortable with my relationship to Spanish. I mourn the loss of a language that I've been told all my life I have a some sort of claim over. But, can I lose something I never really had to begin with?\n\nWhatever the answer may be, one thing is certain: I'll continue belting my heart out to Selena: \"Yo s\u00e9 perder, pero ay c\u00f3mo me duele.\"\n\n\"I know how to lose, but, oh, how it hurts me.\"\n\nKevin Garcia is an intern on NPR's RAD team.

Their D.C. shop, Metro Liquors, was closed for business on Aug. 28, 1963, just one of 1,900 businesses ordered by local authorities not to sell, pour or wrap any alcoholic beverage from 12:01 that morning until 2 a.m. the next day.\n\nMaury Landsman, whose parents ran Metro Liquors, doesn't think his parents actually minded the order that much. For one, his father rarely got vacations, Landsman says. Manny Landsman worked six days a week at the store in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, which was a largely poor and black community back then \u2014 not the trendy spot it is today.\n\nThe second reason, Landsman says, stemmed from his white father's typical, even stereotypical, views \u2014 views he held despite having some African-American employees. \"I recall my father used to say black men always had mustaches and drank a lot.\"\n\nMaury, 20 at the time, didn't share those views. While the liquor store order left Maury 's parents free to stay home, Maury had different ideas about how he would spend the day.\n\nResisting His Parents' \"White-Privileged Attitudes\"\n\nThe decision by the Board of D.C. Commissioners, and similar ones in the nearby Maryland suburbs, temporarily depressed the local economy on an otherwise festive day. For the most part, consumers and local residents not participating in the march stayed home rather than going to work or running errands. Newspapers often describe the atmosphere as a quiet Sunday.\n\nD.C. Commissioner Walter N. Tobriner's written statement, quoted in The Baltimore Afro-American newspaper, said the order wasn't a reflection on the nonviolent demonstrators, \"who will be under strict discipline.\" His concern was that nonparticipants \"might well tend to disturb the peace and quiet of the city\" under the influence of alcohol.\n\nSo while his parents stayed home and watched the march on TV, Landsman headed down to the Mall. He had come home to the Washington suburbs two months earlier, after two years at the University of Chicago. He knew about the march from his student activism in the Windy City, he says, and made up his mind early that he was going. He even invited some of his Chicago buddies to camp out at his parents' apartment for the demonstration.\n\nLandsman also joined some of the new and growing left-leaning groups of the time \u2014 the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, Students for a Democratic Society and the Northern Student Movement. While his civil rights activism began while he was a college student, he says his views may have taken shape even before then.\n\n\"I was raised, in fact, in segregated schools until I was in about the sixth grade,\" he says. \"I went from kindergarten through high school in D.C. public schools.\" It wasn't until the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that the city's schools were integrated. He says his parents had no black friends when they lived in D.C., and he only visited other black students in their homes, never the other way around.\n\n\n\n\"My parents were strange, politically,\" he says. \"I'd describe them as working-class Democrats. They weren't actually racists, but they shared racial attitudes \u2014 what's now called white-privileged attitudes \u2014 of the majority of white people in the United States.\"\n\nLandsman had debates over race with his father's lawyer, a man he occasionally called \"Uncle\" and who was the son of Jewish immigrants, like his father. \"I would get into arguments about how Jews, given the history of the Holocaust, could be bigoted. I remember ... walking out of his house a couple of times,\" he says.\n\nThere were prevailing tensions at home between Landsman, his parents and their upwardly mobile friends and relatives. It was no better after he told them of his plans to attend the march. Safety, not politics, was their issue, he says. \"[It's] not that they were opposed. They were worried about my getting hurt. But I went anyway and they didn't try to stop me.\"\n\n\"Strangers, Black And White, Holding Hands\"\n\nLandsman's memories of the March on Washington revolve around feelings of \"being lifted up,\" he says. \"I was on the left side of the Reflecting Pool near the Lincoln Memorial. I can capture in my mind some of the songs. Some of John Lewis' speech is still in my mind.\n\n\"I remember Marian Anderson, Peter, Paul and Mary, Bob Dylan. I remember Joan Baez. I always found her singing uplifting, and 'We Shall Overcome' \u2014 that was amazing.\"\n\nAs the crowd marched, \"there were strangers, black and white, holding hands\" and singing that song and other spirituals that marked the movement, he says, like \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.\"\n\nLandsman can vaguely imagine his parents watching the day's events on their black-and-white TV but can't recall if they ever discussed it. And the next day, when liquor stores reopened, it was business as usual.\n\nIn the end, Landsman received praise for his activism from his parents' friends, which he says made his parents secretly proud.\n\nNow 70, Landsman is a retired University of Minnesota law professor. Looking back, he's proud of his activism, first around civil rights and later against the Vietnam War. His wife, Julie, has been similarly involved, writing and lecturing on education and race. He describes his son, Aaron, as a \"good progressive, doing his part.\"\n\nWhen asked to offer a six-word statement on race relations today, 50 years after the march, for The Race Card Project, Landsman put it this way: \"Progress, but we are falling back.\"", "keywords": ["views", "black", "biases", "white", "student", "racial", "activism", "despite", "dc", "washington", "joining", "race", "63", "landsman", "parents"], "polarity": 0.036909867909867916, "subjectivity": 0.34256565656565663},

NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Stephanie Gates, a black teacher in Chicago, about why it's important to include race in the conversation around arming teachers.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nOur poll also reflected a racial disparity on the issue of letting teachers carry guns. People of color were far less likely than whites to back the president's proposal.\n\nSTEPHANIE GATES: When I first heard the idea of teachers being armed, I was like, that's absolutely ludicrous.\n\nCHANG: That's Stephanie Gates. She's been teaching in Chicago public schools for 25 years. She's African-American, and most of her students are black or Latino.\n\nGATES: I think the conversation about arming teachers is different for teachers of color because we live in a culture where we have implicit bias. And teachers of color are judged by the color of their skin. So if there's a situation where there's an active shooter and the police enter the building, how do the police know who the active shooter is? And if there's some prejudgment there, they might assume that a teacher of color's actually the shooter.\n\nCHANG: Last week, we spoke with a superintendent in Texas, Ricky Stephens, who has a program much like what President Trump put forward. Some teachers at his schools carry guns, but only the ones who want to and the ones who are trained. Here's what he said.\n\nRICKY STEPHENS: Parents, teachers, even students were saying that that they feel so much more comfortable knowing that they have teachers, who they don't even know, walking the halls that are ready to protect them.\n\nCHANG: So I understand that you don't want to carry a gun at your school, but can you see the point that someone like Ricky Stephens is making - that it would make some people just feel safer?\n\nGATES: So I live in a neighborhood that has high crime. In the summertime on particular days, particularly when it's really hot, we'll have increased police presence. And also when there were shootings that took place in different places in the country, I noticed that we get increased police presence. As someone who lives in the neighborhood where this happens all the time - when I'm driving around and I see increased police presence, it doesn't make me feel safer. It actually makes me feel less safe - because when I see a police car on this corner, and I drive another block and I see a police car on that corner, it makes me think that, at any moment, something can happen.\n\nCHANG: Right. So what you're saying is that the presence of more authority figures in a school, who happen to be armed, can actually increase tension?\n\nGATES: I think it can. We know that the research says that children of color are suspended at higher rates. They're expelled at higher rates. And so now you arm teachers which, I think, would make the environment even more hostile to students of color who are already targeted in some schools.\n\nCHANG: Are you worried, too, that some teachers might not always make the best decision on when to use a gun?\n\nGATES: I think that's a possibility with anybody who carries a gun. And also if you're talking about a teacher who's armed in an active shooter situation, who's to say where bullets go? Worst possible scenario, I'm an armed teacher. An active shooter's in my building. I, you know, engage in a shootout. Who's to say I don't shoot a student?\n\nCHANG: It seems like so many people right now are expressing such tremendous fear after Parkland. Can you relate to any of that? Do you share any of that right now?\n\nGATES: Of course I share fear. I'm a teacher. I walk into a building every day. It concerns me greatly because parents send their children to school to be safe. And I tell that to my students all the time. I say your parents send you to school, and they expect, at the end of the day, for you to come home from school. So yes, it's a fear. And it's always there. But it - if it's greater than what I do, then why would I get up and go to work every day? I have to take that fear. I have to deal with it, and I have to do what I can during the course of the day to make sure that the students, who are entrusted in my care, can go home at the end of the day. All I can do is what I can do.\n\nCHANG: Stephanie Gates is an elementary language arts teacher in Chicago. Thank you so much for talking to us.\n\nGATES: Thank you.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nThis is the second in a two-part report about Clarence B. Jones and the March on Washington.\n\nAug. 28, 1963, was a tense day for Clarence B. Jones. As the longtime attorney and adviser for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Jones had a long list of worries as people started to fill the streets around the monuments on the National Mall. Were the right permits filed? Would the speakers veer off script? Would enough people show up?\n\n\"I had this feeling that we were going to throw a big party and nobody comes,\" Jones recalls.\n\nBut people did come \u2014 at least 250,000 of them. Still, Jones also worried that the crowd might also include agitators, \"some of what I called 'agent provocateurs' \u2014 white as well as black,\" Jones says. \"I didn't know whether some of the black nationalists who were opposed to Dr. King's non-violence, or whether some of the people from the right wing, the Klan ... would provoke something.\"\n\nAnd then there was the delicate and thorny issue of wrangling all those celebrities, Jones says, like Marlon Brando, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, Joanne Woodward, Paul Newman, Joan Baez, Odetta and Bob Dylan, to name just a few.\n\nIn the end, things went smoothly, from the singers and the speakers to the big crowds and blue skies. After sleepless nights and fretful days, Jones was able to take his place on the stage at the Lincoln Memorial and take it all in.\n\n'Tell 'Em About The Dream!'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption NPR/Erica Yoon NPR/Erica Yoon\n\nAmong his most vivid memories is singer Mahalia Jackson at the microphone, Jones says. \"How could you not be moved by this woman's voice? You would have to be unfortunately afflicted with some type of muscular disease that would prevent your muscles reacting to what your ear brought to your body.\"\n\nOf all the entertainers that day, Mahalia Jackson was the singer who had a special hold on King. When King was feeling down, he would speak with Jackson on the phone.\n\n\"I guess you would put it now as 'telephone gospel therapy,' \" Jones says. \"And he would speak to Mahalia Jackson and he would say, 'Mahalia, please sing to me. I'm having a rough day today.'\n\n\"And she would sing one or more of his favorite songs, and ... he would close his eyes listening to her,\" Jones continues. \"In some cases, tears would come down his face and then he would say, 'Mahalia, you are giving me the Lord's voice this morning.' \"\n\nKing had enormous respect for Jackson, Jones says. And because of that, the reverend listened to her when she offered him unsolicited advice while King stood at the podium on the day of the march.\n\nWhile he was reading from the prepared text, Jones says, Jackson shouted at King. \"This is after she had performed, of course, she's sitting down, and she just shouted at him ... 'Tell 'em about the dream, Martin! Tell 'em about the dream!' \"\n\nJackson knew that King had delivered a rousing speech earlier that summer at Detroit's Cobo Hall, bringing the crowd to a feverish pitch when he preached about his dream for a better America. So despite King's prepared script that August day, Jackson encouraged him to bring that moment from Detroit to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\"Now, most people probably didn't have the slightest idea what Mahalia was yelling to Dr. King,\" Jones says. \"What he did upon hearing that, he took the text of the speech \u2014 the written text that he was reading \u2014 and he moved it to the left side of the lectern [and] grabbed the lectern with both his hands.\n\n\"And I see this and I turn to the person standing next to me ... and I said, 'These people don't know it, but they're about ready to go to church.' \"\n\nSix Words And The Letter From Birmingham Jail\n\nJones is proud of his contribution to that moment in history, but he still wishes more of King's dream will be realized in his lifetime. He says he's tremendously proud of progress that's been made. But, as Jones wrote in his book, Behind The Dream, as long as there's a need for a legal category for hate crimes, police officers \"pulling over African Americans because they're driving cars considered out of their financial reach,\" and people \"selling their houses because too many black families have moved in,\" the dream remains diluted, tarnished and unfulfilled, he says.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on race today, Jones harkened back to the letter King wrote from inside the jail in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963. King scribbled out that letter on scraps of paper and it was Jones who secreted those scraps out of the building during several visits. In the letter, published under the headline, \"Why We Can't Wait,\" King said complacency and hate were the enemies of progress.\n\nSo, when asked to offer his six words on race, Jones replies, \"Hate is why we cannot wait.\"", "keywords": ["dream", "day", "king", "text", "letter", "jackson", "wait", "mahalia", "jones", "adviser", "race", "fulfilling", "kings"], "polarity": 0.03074675324675325, "subjectivity": 0.42880952380952375},

Otis is a former federal prosecutor in Virginia, special counsel to former President George H.W. Bush and an adviser at the Drug Enforcement Administration. He currently serves as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nBut it's his years-long record of public comments and Internet posts on crime and drugs that have drawn fire from civil rights groups and prisoner advocates this week.\n\nIn 2013, for instance, Otis commented on a popular legal blog that \"it is precisely because race and criminality have no causative relationship that our side cannot be cowed when the other side starts bellowing about racial disparities in imprisonment, and then claiming they are caused by racism. They are not caused by racism, and as you quite correctly say, they are not caused by race. They are caused by making choices.\"\n\nOtis continued that the main social factor is a \"stable, disciplined, employed, two-parent family life.\" And, he wrote, \"this is the reason that, for example, Orientals have less incidence of crime than whites. ... The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in ours.\"\n\nIn another post, on his Crime and Consequences blog, Otis wrote: \"When Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites, a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. The complaint calls for stern discipline, on the grounds that the remarks were 'discriminatory and biased.' \"\n\nHe added: \"So far as I have been able to discover, it makes no mention of the fact that they're true.\"\n\nOtis is well-known in the community of people who closely follow criminal sentencing. He has long been in favor of stiff mandatory punishments for drug crimes, testifying in Congress and talking with the media, including NPR.\n\nLast year he told Morning Edition, \"What people don't realize as much as they should is that a courier in the drug business is just as essential as a car is in a pizza delivery business.

Among the people who share Otis' approach is Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nWhile lawmakers have failed to pass sweeping measures to reduce mandatory minimum prison terms, the U.S. Sentencing Commission moved in 2014 to pave the way to release thousands of drug offenders.\n\nWord of the Otis nomination prompted outcry from groups that have been working to overhaul the criminal justice system, particularly for people convicted of drug offenses.\n\nFamilies Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit group that works for inmates and their families, had never taken a formal position on a nominee for the Sentencing Commission \u2014 until the Otis pick.\n\n\"Mr. Otis's outdated views are well-known and well-documented,\" said FAMM president Kevin Ring. \"This is not a person who will be guided by evidence and data.

Christie had a good performance in this month's GOP debate despite dropping down to the undercard faceoff. He has gotten some momentum after that performance and has been playing up his national security experience in the aftermath of this month's deadly terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nThat experience is exactly why the newspaper declared it was backing Christie on its front page on Sunday. Union Leader Publisher Joe McQuaid wrote in the editorial:\n\n\"Gov. Christie is right for these dangerous times. He has prosecuted terrorists and dealt admirably with major disasters. But the one reason he may be best-suited to lead during these times is because he tells it like it is and isn't shy about it. Other candidates have gained public and media attention by speaking bluntly. But it's important when you are telling it like it is to actually know what you are talking about.\"\n\nChristie can only go up from here \u2014 he's currently at less than 3 percent in the RealClear Politics average of polling in the state. But the paper's endorsement isn't a silver bullet. The Union Leader doesn't have the best track record when it comes to picking the next president, the eventual GOP nominee \u2014 or even the winner of the New Hampshire primary.\n\nIn the past 50 years, the paper has endorsed only four New Hampshire primary winners \u2014 Richard Nixon in 1968, Ronald Reagan in 1980, Pat Buchanan in 1996 and John McCain in 2008. Of those, only Nixon, Reagan and McCain would go on to win the Republican nomination, and just Nixon and Reagan would be successful in their quest for the presidency.\n\nSo, in the past 35 years, the Union Leader hasn't picked a president.\n\nMore recently, the Union Leader's choice has faded quickly once voting began. In 2000, wealthy publishing executive Steve Forbes finished a very close second to George W. Bush in Iowa. He fell to a distant third in New Hampshire, far behind winner McCain and the second-place Bush. He would withdraw days later.\n\nBut no endorsement by the Union Leader flopped more than its pick of Newt Gingrich in 2012. The former House speaker looked like he was on the rise in late November 2011 but began to slide in mid-December. He would finish a disappointing fourth in New Hampshire but did rebound to win the South Carolina primary \u2014 the apex of his White House bid.\n\nBut the paper's endorsement should not be outright dismissed, especially for a candidate deeply in need of a boost, like Christie. The candidates who have been endorsed by the Union Leader in the past have at least gotten a marginal boost in the New Hampshire primary, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIn 2008, McCain climbed 21 points from where he was polling to where he finished on Election Day. Gingrich went up 9 percentage points.\n\nSo, while history may not be entirely on Christie's side as far as winning the state goes, the endorsement is still a coup for him, especially if he can leverage it right.\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire political science professor Dante Scala noted that right now Christie's campaign in the state is closely mirroring McCain's from eight years ago \u2014 an aggressive town hall schedule and strong retail politicking in every corner of the state.\n\n\"I think for Christie, it gives him something to hang his hat on,\" Scala said. \"He's been all over the state trying to duplicate McCain's magic. He can tell donors, 'Look I'm getting traction. Even though I'm not at the top of the polls, stick with me.' \"\n\nThere are a few reasons Christie is likely to fare better than Gingrich. He has a more robust operation in the state than the former speaker ever did. And he is a natural in the freewheeling town hall events that are popular with New Hampshire Republicans. They showcase his blunt, no-nonsense style that made him a national favorite initially.\n\nPlus, Scala noted, Christie is stopping in many far-flung towns, where presidential candidates don't typically stop, which could help him build deep support.\n\nNew Hampshire voters also are traditionally late to decide whom to support. So, while Donald Trump is still leading polls there, many in the state are skeptical he can keep that lead until the Feb. 9 primary. In 2012, Gingrich began with a distinct disadvantage: Not only was his organization shallow, but Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor with a home in New Hampshire, started with a commanding lead. Far more candidates are in the race this year; the contest is more unsettled, and there's an opening for several candidates to still break out.\n\nStill, there's the question of how relevant newspaper endorsements are in the age of social media and 24/7 news. While many conservatives in the state may read and respect the Union Leader's right-leaning editorial board, they also have far more sources to choose from than they did even eight years ago. While the paper's pick of Christie could make them take notice, they're also likely to be listening to talk radio and conservative TV like Fox News.\n\n\"Those New Hampshire conservatives who are certainly going to vote Republican next February, are they going to be hearing varying messages from other conservative messengers?\" Scala asked.\n\nThe Union Leader's endorsement does note a shift in thinking since the Paris attacks, though. McQuaid, the paper's publisher, said on NBC's Meet The Press that the board only considered governors when making its choice. And it was Christie's experience as a U.S. attorney that stood out over his two other gubernatorial rivals, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\"Jeb Bush doesn't look like he wants it, and the public senses that,\" McQuaid said on NBC. \"I'm looking for somebody who can get the nomination, and I don't think either Bush or Kasich can do so.\"\n\nIn the editorial, he took a particularly noticeable swing at some of the freshman senators running \u2014 Ted Cruz (Texas), Marco Rubio (Florida) and Rand Paul (Kentucky) \u2014 comparing them to President Obama eight years ago.\n\n\"We don't need another fast-talking, well-meaning freshman U.S. senator trying to run the government,\" McQuaid wrote. \"We are still seeing the disastrous effects of the last such choice.\"\n\nAnd there was another dig that seemed aimed at Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina: \"We don't need as President some well-meaning person from the private sector who has no public experience.\"\n\nAnother line that seemed squarely about Trump signaled that the paper would use its power to go after the controversial businessman: \"Other candidates have gained public and media attention by speaking bluntly. But it's important when you are telling it like it is to actually know what you are talking about. Gov. Christie knows what he is saying because he has experienced it. And unlike some others, he believes in what he says because he has a strong set of conservative values.\"\n\nThough this endorsement came around the same time the paper backed Gingrich in 2012, its pick has time to have more impact. The 2016 primary is a month later.\n\nIf the paper spends time not only boosting Christie but attacking Trump, it could truly test whether the front-runner is bulletproof. On NBC Sunday, McQuaid even said some of Christie's \"Trumplike\" qualities in the way he speaks could help him peel away voters.\n\n\"Americans seem to be fed up with Washington, and they are looking for somebody who speaks with the 'bark off,' as we say in New Hampshire,\" McQuaid argued. \"And I think Christie does that. But as we said in the editorial, he does that knowing what he's talking about, as opposed to some others who don't.\"", "keywords": ["mcquaid", "endorsement", "hampshire", "leader", "union", "papers", "christie", "state", "equal", "candidates", "primary", "success", "doesnt"], "polarity": 0.13459849820960934, "subjectivity": 0.46979824702046924},

Twitter also says that was the top moment on their network, as well the second when Florida senator Marco Rubio declared, \"Democrats have their own SuperPAC, it's called the mainstream media.\"\n\nMedia coverage of its own failings was just as critical.

Who are we talking about when we say this? And what do we mean?\n\nNPR reached out to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. She says Americans have been pretty down on \"the media\" for a while, but that, right now, it's really bad.\n\n\"Media credibility historically is down from its high points in the past,\" she says, \"but there is on the conservative end of the political spectrum, an ongoing, more than two-decade long critique, that argues that what we would call the mainstream, or legacy media are biased against conservatives, and employ a double standard, treating conservatives different than liberals in a way that advantages liberals.\"\n\nAnd for Jamieson, this debate only served to exacerbate those frustrations. \"When you open a debate by asking about candidate weaknesses (moderators opened this debate by asking each candidate what their greatest weakness was), in a debate in which the the candidates really are not well known yet, first you're asking a question no competent candidate is actually going to honestly answer,\" she says. \"So, it's largely a waste of time, to find out how they're going to dodge the question.\"\n\nFor Jamieson, part of why \"The Media\" is held in such low regard, compared to times past, is because the media, right now, is very different than what it was a few decades ago.\n\n\"We have a changed media culture,\" Jamieson says. \"When people talk about trust in media across time, they're actually measuring something that's very different. If you look at the 1960s and 1970s for example, you had three possibly four [if you count PBS], major media outlets for broadcast news.\n\n\"Now we've seen ... the rise in online content, and the proliferation of media channels, with the advent both of cable, and then of many forms of online dissemination. And so when people now ask the question, 'do you trust, or how high is the credibility of media,?' They're fundamentally answering a different question than they were in the past.\n\n\"And there's some confusion on the part of the public about who is a journalist at all,\" Jamieson continued.\n\nIt all works to create a perfect storm: A debate with some awkward questions, a public already primed to distrust journalists and a social media landscape primed to jump on the multiple awkward moments that occurred during that debate. And when what you're critiquing is actually up for debate as well, it allows everyone to critique whatever they want.\n\n\"When you ask about the media, often I think what you're actually hearing people say \u2014 particularly people who find most of their news in ideologically compatible outlets \u2014 I think what they're actually saying is, 'what I mean is, the media I don't pay attention to,'\" Jamieson said.\n\nOnline, this critique of the media, led to a backlash, from the media itself. Some journalists even declared war:\n\nTed Cruz says he's \"declaring war on the liberal media.\" So I declared war on Ted Cruz.

Jones: A Guiding Hand Behind 'I Have A Dream'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Norbert von der Groeben/Reuters/Landov Norbert von der Groeben/Reuters/Landov\n\nFor the month of August, Morning Edition and The Race Card Project are looking back at a seminal moment in civil rights history: the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nThis is the first in a two-part report about Clarence B. Jones and the March on Washington.\n\n\n\nAsk Clarence B. Jones to identify himself, and he'll tick off a list of titles. \"I live in Palo Alto, Calif., and I am a visiting professor at the University of San Francisco, and a scholar, writer-in-residence at Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Institute.\"\n\nJones was also the first black man to make partner at a Wall Street investment bank, but he's leaving something else out, too. Jones, 81, was also the personal attorney and adviser to Martin Luther King Jr. during the height of the civil rights movement. Fifty years ago, on the eve of the March on Washington, Jones was working hard to make sure every detail went off without a hitch. Jones remembers it as \"a stressful day.\"\n\nFor all the reminiscing over the years about King and his dream for a better America, the organizers of the march were not just stargazing about change. They had a long and highly specific set of demands. That 10-point list included \"dignified jobs at decent wages,\" \"desegregation of all school districts,\" and a ban on discrimination in \"all housing supported by federal funds,\" among other things.\n\nThe Genesis Of 'The Promissory Note'\n\nJones knew that King would need strong words and strong imagery to make that case. So he suggested language based on a recent experience in Birmingham, Ala. When hundreds of children were arrested after the Children's March in Birmingham in May \u2014 where dogs and fire hoses were unleashed on youngsters \u2014 civil rights organizers needed cash to make bail.\n\n\"I got a call \u2014 an urgent call \u2014 from Harry Belafonte, because we were getting enormous pressure from the parents of these kids to get them out of jail,\" Jones recalls.\n\nThe Rockefeller family wanted to help, so Jones had to fly to New York, go to a bank vault and sign a promissory note in exchange for $100,000 in cash.\n\nThat means, Jones explains, that \"when the creditor calls you and say[s], 'Pay me,' you pay that person.\"\n\nSo when he was helping King draft talking points for his speech, Jones suggested that event would make a powerful analogy.\n\n\"You know, coming here to Washington ... is like we are coming to our nation's capitol and ask[ing] to be repaid, or ask[ing]to be paid in full, on a promissory note,\" Jones says. \"Well, there has to be sufficient funds in the vaults of justice in this country.\"\n\nIndeed, King used that image of a bounced check to assert that America had failed to live up to its promise. \"It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned,\" King intoned from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. \"Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' \"\n\nJones has chronicled his work with King in his book, Behind the Dream, co-authored with Stuart Connelly. And while working on the memoir, Jones had some unlikely source material.\n\ntoggle caption Emily Bogle/FBI\n\nAn Unexpected Historical Archive\n\n\"Little did we know until years later, that every single conference call we had, every single telephone conversation related to the march and other matters, was wiretapped and the contents transcribed by the FBI. So while we would be having so-called confidential conference calls, there was another party that was also a part of everything we did,\" Jones says. \"The contents were wire recorded, transcribed and written into a daily running transcript.\"\n\nAttorney General Robert Kennedy signed off on the wiretaps, Jones says. And because of those wiretaps, Jones now knows how the FBI viewed King's performance at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nSubsequently, Jones says, he was reviewing an internal top-secret FBI memo, when he learned that the FBI considered King dangerous.\n\nUnder a memo titled \"Negro Question,\" the FBI memo said this about King: \"He stands head and shoulders above all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes. We must mark him now, if we have not done so before, as the most dangerous Negro of the future in this Nation.\"\n\nThat memo was dated Aug. 30, 1963 \u2014 two days after the March on Washington. All these years later, Jones is actually grateful for those wiretaps. Thanks to the FBI, he has a vast \u2014 and accurate \u2014 archive of the time.\n\n\"If I have a fuzzy memory or hazy memory, I look at it, and there's a verbatim transcript of the conversations about a certain event, a certain person or a certain problem we were discussing,\" Jones says.\n\nJones always thought the government was listening. King, he says, didn't want to believe him.\n\n\"In his harshest moments, he would \u2014 not accuse me, but he would characterize me as being a 'left-wing McCarthyite.' That I was seeing FBI agents under the bed and all around, just like Joseph McCarthy saw Communists,\" Jones recalls. \"It would come up because often we would have conference calls around 10:30, 11:00 at night, and that's after I had maybe two martinis and a shot of Jack Daniels. ...\n\n\"Anyway, I would get on the phone, and I would say, 'OK, is everybody ready now?' ... And I'd say, 'OK, Mr. FBI man or FBI woman, do you have your pencil ready? Do you have your pad ready now? Because we're gonna start this conference call.'\n\n\"And Dr. King would say, 'Clarence, why don't you stop that? ... They have much better things to do than to listen to our conversation.' \"\n\nOf course, Jones had the last laugh \u2014 and even now, 50 years later, he laughs as he recounts the conversation. \"I said, 'Oh really?'

{"title": "What Does It Mean To Be A 'Nation Of Immigrants'? ", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/02/28/589249748/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-nation-of-immigrants", "text": "What Does It Mean To Be A 'Nation Of Immigrants'?\n\nEnlarge this image Getty Images/Universal Images Group Getty Images/Universal Images Group\n\nFor immigrants, this past week has been a doozy: First, the United States Citizen and Immigration Services took the words \"nation of immigrants\" out of its mission statement. Then, the Supreme Court ruled that immigrants held in detention are not entitled to bail hearings. The Court also declined to to take up a case that deals with the DACA program, sending it back to the Ninth Circuit.\n\nAll this came after weeks of debate about who's allowed to come to, and stay in, the country, as Congress tries to draft a new immigration bill. Among the proposals on the table is the 50-year-old provision that allows family members to sponsor relatives.\n\nThis week on the podcast we explored how one family is handling the stress of decisions and policies like these while facing a mix of immigration-related challenges. In the Gonzalez family, some members are covered by DACA, some aren't, and one child is a U.S. citizen. You can listen to their story here.\n\nBut we also wanted to know more about the bigger picture of where immigrants fit into this nation and how that might be changing.\n\nAnd so we reached out to an expert who can identify with the Gonzalezes and millions of people like them. Hiroshi Motomura is an expert on refugee and immigration law, and teaches at UCLA Law School. But the subject isn't merely academic for him. He comes from a mixed-status family himself, and has spent decades researching, and living, the shifting fortunes of immigrants and their families.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat did growing up in a mixed status family look like for you?\n\nMy father was born in San Francisco, but he grew up in Japan. So he was a U.S. citizen by birth. My mother was born in Japan, so she has Japanese citizenship by birth. I was born in Japan. My family brought me to this country when I was 3 years old under a loophole, at a time when the laws were expressly, explicitly racially discriminatory.\n\nMy brother is six years younger than me, and he was born in the United States, so he had citizenship. So in my own family, my father's a U.S. citizen but really felt Japanese, my mother was a Japanese citizen who felt Japanese, I grew up in this country feeling very American but finding out as a young teenager that I had no citizenship at all.\n\nI'll never forget the time my mother and brother and I went to visit relatives in Japan [when I was a young teen.] I had to travel on a document that can be given to refugees. I was a stateless person living in the United States.\n\nSo it's a lot of details, but I think it shows that in one family, we often have a people separated into different legal statuses by the accident of their birth. And yet functionally, in terms of how they relate to American society, even living in the same household, they're either identical, or separated only by generations.\n\nSupporters of immigrants' rights have criticized President Trump for saying he wants to limit family-based immigration. These critics have compared his policy proposals with parts of the Immigration Act of 1924, which had a national origins quota, or the Chinese Exclusion Act. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nThere's a couple ways to think about the legislative proposals coming out of the White House. We've had a system for many years that has put a high value on family unity. So the proposals would seriously cut back on that.\n\nWhat does that actually mean? Since 1965, we have family-based immigration playing a central role, as it always has, but a central role in a non-discriminatory system \u2014 at least as far as the legal categories are concerned. That's meant that we've really diversified who can come to this country.\n\nSo now, the administration is trying to cut that back. One way to think about that is to look at the consequences: This would really make it hard to immigrate from Latin America. You'd have cutbacks in immigration from Latin America, you'd have cutbacks from Asia. The proposals to cut back on the diversity lottery would cut off a significant amount of immigration from Africa. So at one level it looks like it's very neutral. But the fact is, in historical terms, it's really a rollback to the period from the 1920s until 1965.\n\nHow important is family-based immigration for the people who come to this country?\n\nIt's really been a consistent strand in American immigration history that families are the vehicle for integrating Americans into American society, and helping immigrants be productive members of American society. It's not enough to come to this country with a diploma. It's not enough to come with a particular skill set. You have to have people help you become part of American society. And many of the \"immigrant success stories\" we have are people who came with relatively few resources, or not necessarily stereotypically high education levels, but [succeeded] because there was a family standing behind them.\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about U.S. citizens sponsoring family members. Can you help explain the process?\n\nIn many mixed families, you have a younger child who is a U.S. citizen. And the rules say that when that citizen child turns 21, then the citizen child can sponsor or petition for their parents. But it's not as straightforward as all that. It's true that when the parents have the child turn 21, the child can file paperwork and the parents qualify to get into a category that allows them to get legal status. But there are a couple complications. One is that the sponsor needs to guarantee the financial support of himself and the parents.\n\nThe other thing is that just because you get into a line, it doesn't mean you can get legal status. The system is actually incredibly complicated, and there's talk about, Why don't you stand in line? And yet, we have situations where even people who qualify for a status find the going very difficult.\n\nLooking at the system as a whole, we have an emphasis on employment-based immigration that pretty much requires that you have a college degree. And yet the economy seems to have a very great need for people who don't have a college degree, though many of them are actually very highly-skilled. And one of the reasons that in many of these families, the parents come without legal status is because the system has been set up in such a way that we, for several generations now, have tolerated, and even acquiesced, and to some extent invited people to come outside the law. Occasionally it becomes politically expedient to enforce the law harshly, and we express some shock that people are in the country working illegally.\n\nAnd yet, that's the way the system has run for at least 50 years, and to some extent the last hundred years. Especially regarding workers from Latin America who have been essential to many industries, but for whom there's no actual line to stand in.\n\nHistorically, how has the United States treated immigrants?\n\nI think the arc of American history has been one of generosity toward immigrants, punctuated with periods of retrogression, downright repression. That's been the flow.\n\nAnd we see this actually in the fact that the people who are kind of being hard-line against immigration now are often the very people who would've been discriminated against in an earlier age.\n\nSo one can look at this as hypocrisy, or irony, but the fact of the matter is, it's also a sign that this country moves forward. And the people we discriminated against in an earlier generation, my God, they've become so American that they can actually discriminate against others.\n\nHow do you feel about USCIS taking the line \"nation of immigrants\" out of its mission statement?\n\nWell, I think it's very troubling. The reality is, the United States is, and will continue to be, a nation of immigrants. I'm really focusing not on the possibility that one administration or one agency can change the nature of this country or the character of this country. But I'm focusing on what that means. And I think that it really means that the government is not really taking seriously the types of contributions that immigrants have made to this country. And I think the government is really adopting the posture of, You can only come to this country if you're going to jump through a lot of hoops. You're going to pay a lot of money. And it's going to be based on what you can do for us now. As in tomorrow. Or even today.\n\nBut I think many of the contributions that immigrants have made to this country have not been very obvious on Day 1. This is the many stories we have of people who came to this country either penniless or at least under modest circumstances, and really contributed and created jobs and created entire industries. And I think a lot of what I see in the removal of \"nation of immigrants\" is, are we not understanding the history of this country? We're being extremely short-sighted about what has made this country great.", "keywords": ["family", "nation", "does", "really", "citizen", "system", "think", "american", "immigrants", "country", "come", "mean", "immigration"], "polarity": 0.07952801827801825, "subjectivity": 0.35804533429533425},

They discuss what success in Paris would be and what has to happen afterward.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nIn the run-up to the Paris climate conference, our colleague Ari Shapiro has been speaking with leaders in the effort to come to an agreement, people like Jennifer Morgan. She is the global director of the Climate Program at the World Resources Institute.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: What do you see as the key ingredients that must be in the final deal in order to consider Paris a success?\n\nJENNIFER MORGAN: I think there need to be three things. Number one are clear, long-term and short-term signals that countries are going to come back to the table regularly to increase their ambition until the job is done. Number two is transparency, verification, clarity that countries are going to fulfill those commitments or it will be quite clear that they're not. And number three is a support package for the poorest, most vulnerable countries of the world to be able to adapt to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.\n\nSHAPIRO: What do you see as the key impediments, the things that could come up that would prevent the agreement from being as strong as you would like it to be?\n\nMORGAN: I think there's two potential impediments. One is just that, I think we have about 85 percent of the countries of the world - maybe a little bit more - who get this, who see the risks, who see that the opportunities are there to shift but that those extra 15 percent or 10 percent, that their economies are based on fossil fuels, hold back those targets and those signals moving forward. And it's not possible to get agreement with them.\n\nThe second is just that the poorest countries and the most vulnerable countries don't feel that there's enough in this agreement that they're going to be able to, you know, develop, even to exist. And that gets to the financial package that's put forward, the technical support for countries to adapt to the impacts that are already happening.\n\nSHAPIRO: Well, let's imagine that Paris produces a nearly perfect agreement. You give it an A-plus. What, then, is the greatest threat to it that could totally undermine the thing altogether?\n\nMORGAN: Countries don't ratify or accept the agreement once it's done, and the momentum that's been built up - because Paris is the agreement, but it's also the moment. I mean, just think about all the different announcements and decisions that companies and cities and banks are making - but that that all fizzles away. And so I think what happens the day after Paris, what happens in January 2016 is really almost as important as getting that A-plus.\n\nSHAPIRO: I know that everybody talking about Paris wants achievable goals. They want to feel like the destination is within reach. What's the long-term goal?\n\nMORGAN: We need to get global emissions - so the way we use energy - down to zero by the middle of the century.\n\nSHAPIRO: By the middle of the century, like, in 35 years.\n\nMORGAN: In 35 years, we need to be at zero for our carbon dioxide emissions and by about 2070, for all the greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid just really catastrophic impacts.\n\nSHAPIRO: Well, that just sounds impossible.\n\nMORGAN: Yeah. It's interesting. It is possible. The scientific technical studies show it's possible. It's really about the politics.\n\nSHAPIRO: We're talking about cars, airplanes, home heating, moving things all over the world, basically everything that humans do - no emissions within 35 years.\n\nMORGAN: Yeah, well, 35 years, mid-century. The question of the timing is, how expensive do you want the transition to be? The earlier we start this transition, the less expensive it will be not only because you'll avoid the costs of the impacts, but because then you could have an orderly transition. You can reduce emissions, oh, 2, 3 percent a year, which is what we're, you know, doing right now, instead of 6 or 7 percent a year if we wait. And this is the critical decade that those types of reductions need to happen now. The atmosphere isn't going to wait. I mean, it's not as if it's negotiable with the atmosphere.\n\nMCEVERS: That was Jennifer Morgan with the World Resource Institute talking with our colleague Ari Shapiro.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 NPR.

{"title": "Building the Great Society", "url": "https://www.npr.org/books/titles/580430113/building-the-great-society-inside-lyndon-johnsons-white-house", "text": "Excerpt: Building The Great Society\n\nChapter 1\n\nPut the Ball Through the Hoop\n\nSeated behind his desk in the Oval Office, Lyndon Johnson appeared pensive and subdued when, on the evening of Thursday, November 28, 1963, he delivered brief remarks to the nation. It was 6:15, and LBJ was only in the sixth full day of his presidency. \"Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayers that God may guard this Republic and guide my every labor,\" he began. \"All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget. We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been, but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be, what is to be for America, for the world, for the cause we lead, for all the hopes that live in our hearts.\" Reading with deliberate care from a prepared text, the president acknowledged what was surely on every American's mind: \"A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on. Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose.\"\n\nThe day before, LBJ had delivered his first speech before a joint session of Congress-a solemn and widely acclaimed address in which the new president pledged to pick up the mantle from John F. Kennedy and secure passage of the New Frontier's sweeping but stalled policy agenda, including a major tax cut that Kennedy's advisers believed would stimulate the economy; aid to primary and secondary education; and hospital care for seniors. Dozens of LBJ's former colleagues from Dixie sat in stone-cold silence as Johnson affirmed to stirring applause that \"no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long. We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law.\"\n\nNow, on Thanksgiving, Johnson doubled down, asking his countrymen to join him in prayer \"for His divine wisdom in banishing from our land any injustice or intolerance or oppression to any of our fellow Americans whatever their opinion, whatever the color of their skins\u2014for God made all of us, not some of us, in His image. All of us, not just some of us, are His children.\"\n\nFor most Americans, Thanksgiving week marked the start of the holiday season. For Lyndon Johnson, it signaled the beginning of an intense, yearlong sprint to prove that he could break the logjam, achieve the New Frontier, and surpass it beyond even the wildest expectations of John Kennedy's supporters. It would be no easy lift.\n\n\"I think the Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was there in the Congress,\" Kennedy remarked roughly a year before his death. For well over two decades, a coalition of conservative southern Democrats and northern Republicans had stymied the expansion of domestic policies first established during the New Deal era. In the Senate, an institution that the journalist William White once dubbed \"the South's unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg,\" conservatives made frequent use of the filibuster to prevent social welfare and civil rights legislation from coming to a vote, while in the House powerful southerners kept such measures forever bottled up in committee. Now, in a sharp rebuke to Kennedy's promise of dynamic action and national rejuvenation, the conservative coalition had all but ground the government to a halt. Not only did the House and the Senate refuse to take up key New Frontier measures. They also refused to pass eight of twelve routine appropriations bills, thus leaving whole parts of the government unfunded and operating on a continuing resolution that set spending at the previous year's levels.\n\nCongressional Quarterly deemed the state of affairs \"unprecedented,\" while Walter Lippmann, the dean of American journalism, bemoaned the \"scandal of drift and inefficiency\" that had beset Washington. \"This Congress has gone further than any other within memory to replace debate and decision by delay and stultification. This is one of those moments when there is reason to wonder whether the congressional system as it now operates is not a grave danger to the Republic.\" Yet as Harry Truman famously asserted, the buck stopped with the president. A week before Kennedy's assassination, the columnist James Reston noted \"a vague feeling of doubt and disappointment about President Kennedy's first term. . . . He has touched the intellect of the country, but not its heart. He has informed but not inspired the nation. He is the most popular figure, but he has been lucky in his competition. . . . [H]is problem is probably not how to get elected but how to govern.\"\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when Lyndon Johnson entered the White House.\n\nLBJ first came to Washington as a young congressional staff member in the early 1930s before returning to Texas in 1935 to serve as state director of the National Youth Administration (NYA), a marquee New Deal jobs project. Two years later, and against all odds, he won a special election to Congress at age twenty-eight. An ardent supporter of Franklin Roosevelt, Johnson established a more liberal voting record than most southern Democrats with whom he served in the House. Though he consistently opposed legislation to abolish the poll tax and to make lynching a federal crime, he joined northern Democrats in supporting expanded rights for organized labor, greater administrative oversight of business and industry, and funding for public works. Notably, he continued to do so long after most of his southern Democratic colleagues forged an informal alliance with northern Republicans to oppose the Roosevelt administration. On the strength of his New Deal credentials, FDR strongly backed Johnson in a special election to fill an unexpired Senate seat in 1941. LBJ most likely won the primary (in Texas, as throughout the South, the only vote that mattered), but party rivals stole it from him in a brazen display of election-night ballot fraud. Though in the coming years he aligned himself more closely with his state's oil and gas interests, when he ran a second time for the Senate in 1948, Johnson was once again recognized as the liberal option. After achieving a razor-thin primary victory over the conservative former governor Coke Stevenson-this time, it was likely LBJs allies who stole the election-Johnson drifted rightward during his two terms in the Senate, in part out of recognition that Texas was moving strongly in that direction and in part to curry favor with the chamber's powerful southern chairmen, most notably Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia. Johnson delivered his maiden floor speech in opposition to civil rights, turned against former New Deal allies who now stood accused of communist loyalty, and, in his time as Democratic leader after 1953, cooperated closely with the Eisenhower administration. Many of the liberals in his caucus came to despise LBJ, particularly after he neutered their civil rights bill in 1957. They correctly perceived that he wanted to pass a weak bill in order to make his prospective presidential candidacy in 1960 palatable to northern Democrats but unobjectionable to his fellow southerners. On the day that he assumed office, very few people knew what to make of Lyndon Johnson. Was he simply a pragmatist who, deep in his heart, remained an ardent New Dealer? Or was he a southern conservative who would betray John Kennedy's unfinished legacy?\n\nIf Johnson's belief system was a matter of wide speculation, few observers doubted his keen understanding of Congress. LBJ knew that conservative Democrats, in loose cooperation with Republicans, had willfully manufactured a bottleneck of important legislation to form a bulwark against Kennedy's civil rights bill. Only when liberals capitulated and withdrew the Civil Rights Act would southern Democrats consent to bring Kennedy's tax stimulus to a vote and fund the many government initiatives-including bridges, highways, post offices, and defense projects-that their more liberal and moderate colleagues hoped to deliver to hometown constituents. Johnson knew the playbook because, as a freshman senator, he had helped to write it. As long as conservatives could hold the government hostage, much as they had in 1949, when they successfully fought back Harry Truman's civil rights agenda, they could forestall consideration of Kennedy's New Frontier agenda, including civil rights legislation that lay dying on the Hill.\n\nIt took LBJ less than a day to spring into action. In a series of phone calls before and after Thanksgiving 1963, the new president highlighted the imperative of using his political capital to clear the logjam; then, and only then, would members of Congress feel at liberty to bring civil rights and other New Frontier measures to a vote. In the meantime, however, he would keep up the pressure. On Saturday, November 30\u2014just over a week after assuming the presidency\u2014LBJ asked the former Treasury secretary Robert Anderson, a Republican and outspoken fiscal conservative, to intervene with Howard Smith, the chairman of the Rules Committee, which had broad authority to prevent legislation from proceeding to the House floor. Johnson reminded Anderson that \"this country is not in any condition to take that kind of stuff . . . and that's going to hurt our people. And it's going to hurt the conservatives.\" Anderson agreed to speak with Smith and to convey the president's willingness to support a seldom-used measure\u2014a discharge petition\u2014to bypass Smith's committee altogether and bring the legislation directly to the full House.\n\nPlaying the other side just as artfully, Johnson placed a call to Dave McDonald, the president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) and a member in good standing of the liberal coalition. \"They've got to petition it out,\" the president instructed. \"That means we got to get 219. We'll start at about 150 Democrats; that means we got to get 60, 70 Republicans.\" The president spoke with the passion of a true believer (\"we've been talking about this for 100 years. And they won't give us a hearing on this thing, so we got to do something about it\") and implored McDonald to fire up his union's formidable lobbying operation\u2014not only to support the discharge petition in the House, but also to move the tax and appropriations bills through committee.\n\nBefore and after the Thanksgiving holiday, Johnson repeated these conversations time and again, at once lining up support for a discharge petition in the House while affirming the need to clear the logjam of tax and spending bills before making a final push on civil rights in the Senate. Among those who understood the president's strategy was Senator George Smathers, a conservative Democrat from Florida who ultimately opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but who represented a faction of the southern caucus that was disinclined to grind all government to a halt indefinitely over civil rights. The \"sooner we can get a civil rights bill over with,\" he told Johnson, \"get that part of it ended and out of the way, the better off the South's going to be, and the better off the North's going to be, and the better off everybody's going to be. And they wouldn't hide behind the tax bill\u2014and hide behind a lot of other bills, just on the pretense of being against them when the real fact is they're against the civil rights bill.\"\n\nWithout prompting\u2014and without the knowledge that LBJ had been making a similar case to his economic advisers for several days\u2014Smathers suggested that the president make a concerted effort to woo Harry F. Byrd, the deeply conservative chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. If Johnson were willing to indulge Byrd's obsession with fiscal discipline and bring the 1964-1965 federal budget under $100 billion, then the chairman might allow the tax cut to clear through his committee. \"Wish you'd feel Byrd out,\" LBJ agreed, \"and give me a pretty good, full report.\" Unknowingly, George Smathers would help set in motion a chain of events whose consequences would be far reaching.\n\nThe strategy that Lyndon Johnson developed in the first week of his presidency had a profound but highly calculated effect. The pressure that his supporters placed on Howard Smith\u2014and the chairman's realization that a discharge petition, if successful, would permanently undermine his authority\u2014persuaded the cantankerous Virginian to allow the Civil Rights Act to reach the House floor. Beginning with outreach from Smathers, LBJ simultaneously courted Harry Byrd until the patrician senator effectively agreed to swap budget cuts for a tax stimulus. With major economic legislation now cleared through Congress, the president had paved the way for passage of long-awaited civil rights legislation.\n\nJust before the Thanksgiving holiday, some of Johnson's advisers cautioned him that presidents should not spend valuable capital on hopeless causes. \"Well,\" he purportedly replied, \"what the hell's the presidency for?\"\n\nLBJ ultimately brought his budget under $100 billion, pushed Kennedy's tax cut through Congress, and secured passage of the Civil Rights Act-all by late June 1964. He accomplished these measures while also declaring an \"unconditional war on poverty\" and creating the blueprint for the Great Society\u2014the most ambitious domestic agenda since the New Deal. Though LBJ's early success owed in part to his mastery of legislative strategy, equally fundamental were efforts by advocacy groups-religious and lay alike-on behalf of civil rights and social justice legislation. Above all, Johnson benefited from a deep well of public support in the wake of Kennedy's assassination. The president's approval ratings, which fluctuated between 70 percent and 77 percent throughout the spring, owed at least as much to the country's determination to lock arms with its new leader as to LBJ's policy and political triumphs.\n\nUnlike most of his predecessors, LBJ did not enjoy the benefit of a transition period to build the team that would help him, in turn, build his vision. Instead, he had little choice but to improvise on the spot\u2014to pull a trusted friend like Jack Valenti along with him to the White House or entreat old hands from his House and Senate days to join him on a new and unfamiliar journey. These handicaps notwithstanding, in that first year of seemingly unrestrained activity and accomplishment\u2014from the time of Kennedy's death to his own election to the presidency in late 1964\u2014Johnson assembled an ad hoc staff that defied the expectations of even the most cynical Washington hands. They were a \"coalition government\" of Kennedy and Johnson men\u2014a \"strange amalgam of Austin and Boston, of cool, brainy Easterners and shrewd, folksy Texans, of men who had always been fiercely loyal to him and men who had fought and belittled him before the 1960 Los Angeles Democratic convention,\" according to Charles Roberts, who covered the White House for Newsweek. \"It is some kind of tribute to Isaiah and the LBJ Way that the transition went as smoothly as it did.\"", "keywords": ["building", "legislation", "tax", "senate", "civil", "kennedys", "society", "rights", "great", "house", "johnson", "lbj", "president"], "polarity": 0.15173983379725015, "subjectivity": 0.46541957112531274},

Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream Speech\" Aug. 28, 1963. Approximately 250,000 people descended on the nation's capital from all over the country for the mass demonstration.\n\nThrough The Race Card Project's six-word stories, we'll meet some of the people who witnessed that history and hear their memories and reflections on race relations in America today.\n\nWith hindsight, we now know the March on Washington was a peaceful event. But two former D.C. police officers who worked the event that day remember that there was no guarantee that the day would go smoothly.\n\nBack in 1963, Joseph Burden, who is black, and Martin Niverth, who is white, were both rookie cops with the D.C. police department, living in a highly segregated city and working for a segregated police force.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Martin Niverth Courtesy of Martin Niverth\n\n\"If you walked a foot beat, you walked with another white officer,\" Niverth says. \"If you were assigned to a car, you were assigned to a car with another white officer.\"\n\n\"I do recall, at one time, they passed out 3x5 cards and ... instructed us to write down whether you would like to work with an integrated partner,\" Burden remembers. \"The 'noes' were overwhelming. So it was quite obvious that, as far as they [the white officers] were concerned, they didn't want to work with us. And I guess they really had very little use for Martin Luther King.\"\n\nAll Hands On Deck\n\nFor a segregated police force, a mass demonstration calling for racial equality presented challenges. The police department readied the officers by stressing the need to maintain order and the dignity of the force. After all, this was just months after Birmingham's commissioner for public safety, Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, had unleashed dogs and fire hoses on peaceful demonstrators in that city.\n\nThough 19,000 federal troops were stationed just outside the D.C. city limits, police officers in Washington were not instructed to wear riot gear. Officers wore \"no special equipment, just regular uniforms that we would use if we were walking the beat,\" Burden says.\n\n\"Before I went to work, I shined my shoes, cleaned by brass, checked my revolver, and made sure I had my badge and my wallet,\" Niverth recalls.\n\nEveryone worked that day \u2014 no vacation days were granted. The entire force gathered early at the police garage downtown for instructions. It was a hot, humid day in the nation's capital, even at 6 a.m., Niverth remembers. Both officers recall that the instructions were fairly simple: Be alert. Be safe. Keep calm.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Erica Yoon/NPR Erica Yoon/NPR\n\nBurden was assigned to the Lincoln Memorial and ended up on the steps right behind where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his speech. Niverth was instructed to patrol a several-block stretch along the National Mall, quite a distance from where the central activities were taking place.\n\n\"You just do what you do any other day, you know,\" he says. \"You just walked the beat, [made] sure things are orderly.\"\n\nTwo Officers, Different Opportunities\n\nBut Niverth's partner assignment that day was anything but routine.\n\n\"I don't know why they did this; they assigned me with another rookie \u2014 and he was a black officer,\" Niverth says. \"His name was William Wallace.\"\n\n\"I wasn't out there too long before I did realize that this was a pretty significant event,\" Niverth says. By 9 a.m., \"people started to show up, and they started to show up in great numbers. ... You could see they had a purpose. But they weren't angry. I didn't feel threatened as a police officer on the street.\"\n\nIn fact, one black family in attendance shared their lunch with Niverth and Wallace. \"Me and Wallace walked over and they asked us if we wanted something. And they gave us a small plate.\"\n\nNiverth and Wallace may have had shared personal ambitions for growth in their department, but the signs and speakers at the March reminded Niverth that the playing field was not level back in 1963.\n\n\"We weren't walking the beat in our area too long and [Wallace] says, 'Marty, ... I hope you think this is an important day, that it's important to us.'\n\n\"And I said, 'Yes, I do.' \"\n\nAnd as speaker after speaker called for equality and justice, Burden felt somewhat torn as a rookie cop. \"Being a police officer, not too long out of the police academy, you're thinking more of the law than you are thinking in terms of how you fit into the big picture,\" Burden says. \"So I was thinking in terms of, you know, if you're shutting down traffic and what not, that's a violation.\"\n\nYet the marchers were fighting for rights that Burden didn't have. \"When I saw those signs and placards and whatnot that the people were holding, then I realized, you know, they were speaking about me as well.\n\n\"You know, I had a job, but I needed the freedom as well. I was thinking back on the times when I couldn't go into the five-and-dime store to drink a Coke at the counter, and I couldn't go to the theaters downtown and things of this nature,\" Burden continues. \"When I think back, yes, I wish I could have marched.\"\n\nA Changed Force, A Changed Nation\n\nBurden and Niverth both say that, in all their years of police work, the March for Jobs and Freedom was the most peaceful and most festive mass demonstration they had ever seen. The event helped usher in a new era in the D.C. Police Department \u2014 more promotions, more integrated partnerships and more recruiting of women and people of color.\n\nTwo years later, Joe Burden became one of the first black officers assigned to an integrated patrol car in Washington. And Martin Niverth became lifelong friends with William Wallace, the officer with whom he was partnered at the march in '63. Both officers are now retired from the D.C. police department, but still live in the Washington area.\n\nWhen asked to share his six words about race relations in America today, Niverth offers, \"Progress, but long way to go.\" He chose those words, he says, \"because I was under the false impression that civil rights causes were resolved. Until some of the recent things have been occurring, and state legislators about voting rights, etc.\"\n\nBurden's six words reflect the many years of his police career spent working with young people: \"The youngsters are making the changes.\"\n\n\"The changes are coming about with the youngsters,\" he explains. \"They're the ones that you see are interacting with one another, you see them marrying one another, you see them doing away with all discriminatory practices, you see them opening themselves up to \u2014 everything.\"", "keywords": ["white", "black", "burden", "day", "martin", "washington", "know", "officers", "walking", "officer", "niverth", "beat", "63", "wallace"], "polarity": 0.09677500890163229, "subjectivity": 0.4257529411425515},

The biggest riot at the time was in Detroit. After five days of rioting, 33 blacks and 10 whites were dead and property damage totaled more than $100 million.\n\nUnnerved by the scale of Detroit's unrest, and anxious to find the root causes of the violence, President Lyndon Johnson announced to the nation that he'd convened a new commission, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. The 11-person group would be headed by Otto Kerner, then governor of Illinois. Its charge: to discover what happened, why it happened and how to prevent it from happening again.\n\nThe Commission's members (all male and all white, except for NAACP head Roy Wilkins and Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass.) took field trips to several trouble spots. They interviewed residents and consulted with their own team of demographers and analysts to understand the depths of the effects of segregation and other forms of discrimination. (During one such visit, a man told Commission members Fred Harris, then a senator from Oklahoma and his trip partner New York Mayor John Lindsay, he saw more white people in the Mississippi hometown he'd fled than his adopted city of Milwaukee. His life was that segregated.)\n\nWarnings in a best-seller\n\nThe conclusions were dire. Institutional and systemic racism were responsible for many of the ills that beset black America, the report said. The segregated housing, subpar public schools and aggressive policing of black and brown communities could all be traced back to the second-class treatment of America's darker citizens. The nation, the report famously warned, was \"moving toward two societies, one black, one white\u2014separate and unequal.\"\n\nThe Commission's report was published as a paperback, and became a national best-seller. Virtually no one referred to it by its formal name Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders; it simply became the Kerner Report. And while some progress has been made since the report was initially released, a lot of things have gotten worse.\n\nA new study that builds on the Kerner Report's work was released this week. Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report was co-edited by Fred Harris (the sole surviving member of the original Commission) and Alan Curtis, CEO of the Milton Eisenhower Foundation. It notes that poverty has increased and so has the inequality gap between white America and Americans who are black, brown and Native American. The gains children of color made when efforts continued to desegregate schools in the 60s began to reverse by 1988. Court decisions that loosened oversight of previously de facto segregated schools resulted in a huge change: In 1988, almost half of all students of color went to majority-white schools. Today that number has plummeted to 20 percent. Poverty is such a problem, the study concluded, that if it is not mitigated, America's very democracy is threatened.\n\n\"I was 37 when I served on the (Kerner) Commission,\" Harris told NPR. \"Whoever thought that 50 years later, we'd still be talking about the same things? That's kinda sad.\"\n\nKerner's continued relevance\n\nJulian E. Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton who has written extensively on the Kerner Commission, said the original report remains germane. \"In terms of criminal justice and the way race affects it, I think the findings are so relevant. You could almost take portions of the report, adjust them, obviously, to contemporary times, but they'd still resonate with what we're dealing with today.\"\n\nZelizer says Johnson wasn't even sure he wanted to convene a panel to study racial unrest. That would be tricky even in the best of times, and those times weren't that.\n\n\"He's very fearful from the start that the Commission would end up blaming him,\" Zelizer explained. \"And at the same time, they'll say you have to do things that Congress, he knows, will never accept, and he would look bad.\"\n\nAfter his Herculean effort to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, could the architect of The Great Society be remembered instead as the president who bungled race? That possibility was very much on the president's mind.\n\nJohnson's trepidation \u2014 and his annoyance that his Great Society programs were not credited in the report (members said they didn't want to politicize their findings) \u2014 led him to ignore the Kerner Commission. There was no ceremonial handover of the report in the Oval Office or elsewhere, no handshakes, no thank yous.\n\n\"He refused to meet with us to receive our report,\" Harris confirms. \"And that's particularly sad to me because President Johnson did more against racism and poverty than any president before or since.\"\n\nNo love from the White House\n\nPeniel Joseph, a University of Texas historian, says Johnson was in a tight spot. The Vietnam war was not going well. Martin Luther King Jr. was preparing to begin several marches that would highlight the poverty of black America. And politicians in his own Democratic Party, such as Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy and, later former Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were making noises about challenging him for the presidency. He felt hounded on all sides.\n\n\"He was being criticized from his left by people like Dr. King, who was saying all the money he was spending in Vietnam should be spent on antipoverty efforts and racial justice efforts,\" Joseph says.\n\n\"And on his right,\" he continued, \"He was being criticized by conservatives who supported the war effort, but rejected the Great Society, and who felt as if the Great Society was justifying law and disorder.\"\n\nSo the Kerner Report was put aside, and would soon be eclipsed by the tsunami of historical events that followed that year: King's assassination in April, Robert Kennedy's in June, the train wreck that was the Democratic National Convention in August, with its Chicago street protests and unhinged police violence. Richard Nixon's election campaign that fall centered on a law-and-order platform.\n\nBut landmark anniversaries have a way of focusing people's attention. The date, the continued attention on problems the Kerner Report focused on (the militarization of police departments, for instance) and the new study may renew people's interest.\n\nAnd maybe enlightened self-interest will help. \"Racial and ethnic inequality is still with us,\" Fred Harris told the Washington Post. \"What's happening in the country is bad for all of us. Doing something about it is good for all of us.\"", "keywords": ["racism", "black", "white", "commission", "1968", "kerner", "finds", "report", "segregation", "updates", "society", "schools", "landmark", "harris", "poverty", "study"], "polarity": 0.08177489177489178, "subjectivity": 0.43205755566515064},

They hear you saying the word 'Allah,' they freak out and they get scared.\"\n\nInstead, he suggests keeping those prayers internal: \"Allah can always hear you,\" he says.\n\nAfter prayers, Selim explains why he chose that message: \"We've heard things in the past couple weeks about people saying things on airplanes, telling Muslims they don't feel comfortable having them sitting next to them or saying, 'We don't feel safe having this lady with her headscarf in the same airplane.' Things like this are the kind of things I worry about.\"\n\nThe crowd of about 120 people who filled the prayer hall are from diverse backgrounds. They include new immigrants from countries like Somalia and Sudan, but there are many whose roots in Iowa date back to the late 19th century, when their forebears immigrated from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThis is one of the oldest Muslim communities in the U.S. Its original prayer hall, the Mother Mosque of America, built in 1934, is the oldest mosque in the country.

He reads from one, sent by a church in Iowa.\n\n\"At this time of unrest and suspiciousness towards Muslims, by various groups in the U.S., we would like to express our support and friendship to you,\" he reads.\n\nWhen Selim's done, he adds: \"That's what keeps us going.\"\n\nThese days, Selim spends a lot of his time doing community outreach at churches, universities and libraries. He explains his faith, his concerns, how he lives his life.

After Thanksgiving, there are some clear themes emerging in the state of the presidential race.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nThere are now 10 weeks to go until people actually vote in this season of presidential caucuses and primaries. And what with the Christmas and New Year's breaks, it may feel like a short 10 weeks at that. Most Americans will have many other things on their minds. But looking ahead, some clear themes are emerging in this campaign. And here to talk about those themes and what to expect is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Robert.\n\nSIEGEL: The conventional wisdom has been that Donald Trump, on top on the Republican side, will eventually fade. The campaign will return to a more traditional form. How much confidence do you have that the Republican campaign is finally reverting to form?\n\nLIASSON: Well, not too much confidence right now. There's no doubt the race is changing. Carson seems to have slumped, especially in Iowa, which was his stronghold with evangelical voters. But Trump has stayed on top. He's in the mid-20s, up to 30 percent range in the early state polls and nationally. Although, national polls mean very little in a primary race. But more and more Republicans can say they can imagine what, to them, just a month or two ago, was unimaginable, that Trump could conceivably be the nominee or at least that he'd win their states if the primaries were held today.\n\nSIEGEL: Mara, we just heard about Clay Masters about Ted Cruz in Iowa. He's been making up some ground there. Do you think he has a real shot?\n\nLIASSON: I do. I think he has a real shot at winning Iowa. As you just heard, he is now polling in Iowa second to Donald Trump's 25 percent in the latest Quinnipiac poll. Cruz has 23. Carson has slipped down to 18 percent. Ted Cruz has a lot of money. He has a good, far-reaching field operation, and his strategy all along has been to position himself as the insider-outsider, the natural inheritor of the conservative, evangelical Tea Party vote if and when Trump and Carson fade. And that looks like it's happening with Carson.\n\nAnd Cruz has probably picked up some of the Carson vote. His campaign believes he is now beginning to consolidate the conservative vote. He's been very careful to never criticize Donald Trump. He's politely separated himself from Trump only once, and that was on the idea of a database registry for Muslims. And Cruz's theory is that a conservative Republican can win the general election because conservatives - a conservative would be able to energize millions of conservative voters who have simply stayed home in the past because they weren't excited enough to vote for modern establishment candidates, supposedly more electable candidates like John McCain or Mitt Romney.\n\nSIEGEL: One place where the candidates have been getting a lot of attention is obviously in the debates. There are two debates coming up before the end of the year, one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats. Have the debates really mattered, Mara?\n\nLIASSON: The debates have definitely mattered. On the Republican side, tens of millions of people have watched them. I don't think they've been determinative, but they have changed the fortunes of some candidates. They've winnowed the field. Several candidates who couldn't get on the main debate stage have dropped out. Jeb Bush's poor debate performances have certainly hurt him. Marco Rubio's polished, very self-assured performances have impressed big Super PAC donors, and Rubio has recently netted some new billionaire supporters.\n\nAnd Ted Cruz has also stood out. He has used the debates very, very skillfully. He's led the attack on the mainstream media, which is one of the big themes of the Republican race. But we should point out that two candidates, Trump and Carson, do not seem to have been affected very much or at all by their debate performances. Neither of them have been standouts in the debates.\n\nSIEGEL: How about the Democrats? The debates there seem to have winnowed the field down. It's basically three candidates now - Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley. Would you say is the state of play on the Democratic side?\n\nLIASSON: Well, Hillary Clinton continues to consolidate her lead in the polls. She certainly has a lead nationally, but national polls don't matter that much. But she does have a small lead in Iowa. Bernie Sanders is giving her a run for her money there. He's very close behind her or some - in some polls, ahead of her in New Hampshire. But New Hampshire and Iowa have very white Democrat electorates.\n\nWhere Hillary Clinton really is strong is in the South. She's built a very big, strong firewall, mostly with minority voters. And you know, today, the State Department is releasing another cache of Clinton's emails. And most Democrats I talked to say that only an indictment by the Justice Department could change the dynamic in the Democratic race. You know, the FBI is investigating whether Clinton knowingly sent any classified emails. But just to give you an example of how Democrats are not hedging their bets - in the count of elected officials endorsing candidates, right now, Clinton has a 45-1 lead over Bernie Sanders in terms of Democratic elected official support.\n\nSIEGEL: OK.

Tom, thanks very much for being with us.\n\nTOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.\n\nSIMON: Down two games and - forgive me - you can't talk sports without a few good cliches. The Mets really came to play last night from the first pitch, didn't they?\n\nGOLDMAN: (Laughter) That first pitch by the Mets' Noah Syndergaard reminded me of a Scott Simon first question.\n\nSIMON: (Laughter).\n\nGOLDMAN: High and tight and meant to rattle. Syndergaard buzzed Kansas City leadoff hitter, Alcides Escobar, with a pitch...\n\nSIMON: He needed a shave. I can see it - I can see it myself, yeah.\n\nGOLDMAN: Exactly and it left Escobar's teammates screaming at Syndergaard from the dugout. And Syndergaard said about it my intent on that pitch was to make them uncomfortable, and I feel like I did just that. Now, it took the Mets a few innings to back it up, but they did with timely homeruns from a couple of veterans - David Wright, Curtis Granderson - and then a relentless offensive attack after that.\n\nSIMON: The 1-9-3 - what do you foresee for tonight's game at Citi Field?

Mondesi, 20-years-old, son of a major leaguer - made his major league debut in the World Series.\n\nGOLDMAN: (Laughter) Yeah, for the Royals, he became the first major leaguer to make his major league debut in the World Series. He pinch-hit. He struck out...\n\nSIMON: Yeah...\n\nGOLDMAN: But he said he was still happy to get a chance...\n\nSIMON: A lot of great careers have begun with a strikeout. NBA season's just getting started, and there's one team that's uniting all of basketball at the moment, aren't they? The Los Angeles Clippers - and not the way they used to unite people.\n\nGOLDMAN: Yeah, right. Well, I'm not sure if they're uniting the entire league but certainly Dallas Mavs owner Mark Cuban set the tone Thursday when he said prior to Dallas' game versus the Clippers that he doesn't give a bleep about the Clippers. And then showed that he does because he said about them you can change the players, you can change the owner, but the Clippers are who they've been for the last 30 years. Now, Mark Cuban appears to still be a...\n\nSIMON: Which his loser, right?\n\nGOLDMAN: (Laughter)Yeah...\n\nSIMON: Yeah, OK.\n\nGOLDMAN: ...Exactly. No, he is - he appears to still be angry about LA center DeAndre Jordan's free agency flip-flop during the summer when Jordan agreed to sign with Dallas then changed his mind. Oh, but didn't contact Cuban or the Mavs about the decision.\n\nSIMON: Yeah.\n\nGOLDMAN: The game Thursday was chippy with hard fouls and technicals and an almost fight involving Jordan. One nice moment during the game - one of the greatest features of big-time pro-sports - the kiss cam...\n\nSIMON: Oh, I love this actually, yeah.\n\nGOLDMAN: I know. It flashed both Cuban and LA owner Steve Ballmer on the big screen. They blew kisses at each other but the script appears to be set. It looks like we've got a bit of a nasty rivalry going between these two teams. And don't we all love a nasty rivalry?\n\nSIMON: Yeah, and - I mean, yes, the rest of the league enjoys this, right?\n\nGOLDMAN: Absolutely. Oh, yeah. The Clippers are no one's - except people in LA's - favorite really.\n\nSIMON: All right. Thanks so much, NPR's Tom Goldman. Talk to you soon. Take care.\n\nGOLDMAN: OK, Scott.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 NPR. All rights reserved.

He's come under increasing pressure since the November release of dashcam video showing the officer shooting McDonald.\n\nThousands of emails were released to AP and other outlets after an open-records request. Here are more details about what the emails say from the wire service:\n\n\"In May, mayoral spokesman Adam Collins complained to colleagues that the Independent Police Review Authority did not follow his recommendation on how to respond to a TV station about McDonald. \"Days before the video's release, Collins wrote to police and law department representatives urging them to speak with 'one voice' on the topic. \"Emanuel's senior legal adviser, Stephen Patton, emailed Collins on Dec. 9, 2014, saying he told his staff to inform him 'immediately' when a lawsuit in the case was filed. \"The emails also included messages in which officials asked how they should respond to demands for footage.\"\n\nAfter the release of the emails, Adam Collins, a spokesman for the mayor, told The Chicago Sun-Times that \"City Hall was never involved with [the Independent Police Review Authority's] investigation of McDonald.\" He says \"the mayor's office obviously does not direct investigations, nor are any employees involved in those investigations.\"\n\nNPR's Cheryl Corley spoke to protester Mack Julion in Chicago, who says he doesn't think Emanuel was trying to be open about what happened. \"I think those are all reactionary efforts that he's making due that he's in, to try to save his position.\"\n\nEmanuel announced changes to police training on Wednesday, as we reported.", "keywords": ["tannen", "laquan", "told", "release", "emails", "thousands", "think", "shooting", "hes", "chicago", "collins", "mcdonald", "releases"], "polarity": -0.016666666666666663, "subjectivity": 0.2857142857142857}
