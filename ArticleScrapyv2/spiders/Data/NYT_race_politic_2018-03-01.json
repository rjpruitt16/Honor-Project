Image President Trump and Senator Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday at the White House. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump discussed potential solutions to curb gun violence on Wednesday during a televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.\n\nThe president strayed from the facts during his remarks, as The New York Times reported previously. Here is a look at the claims made during the session by other lawmakers \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 that may have strayed from the facts or otherwise require some additional context.\n\n\u201cThis is when the 10-year assault weapon ban was in \u2014 how incidents and deaths dropped. When it ended, you see it going up.\u201d \u2014 Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThis needs context.\n\nIn the past, Ms. Feinstein has referenced an analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that found the assault weapons ban drastically reduced gun massacres.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to most experts and research.\n\nAs The Times has previously reported:\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place. Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident. \u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThese shooters typically are males. They\u2019re white and they\u2019re suicidal.\u201d \u2014 Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana\n\nTrue.\n\nA database maintained by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, shows that 95 out of 97 mass shootings from 1982 to 2018 involved male gunmen. Fifty-five were committed by white men.\n\n\u201cThe states that have these background checks, they have a 38 percent lower domestic homicide rate \u2014 this is domestic violence.\u201d \u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota\n\nCausation is not clear.\n\nMs. Klobuchar is probably referring to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, that claims \u201c38 percent fewer women\u201d are \u201cshot to death by intimate partners\u201d in states that require background checks for all handgun sales.\n\nThis analysis, however, does not account for other factors that contribute to domestic violence, leading other researchers to question the sweeping conclusion about background checks.\n\nApril Zeoli, a professor at Michigan State University who studies intimate partner violence, called the Everytown estimate a \u201cback of the napkin\u201d calculation.\n\nMs. Zeoli\u2019s research has found that state laws restricting access to firearms for people who have been convicted of domestic violence result in declines in intimate partner homicides; specifically, 11 percent from laws that mandate buyers to get a permit whether they\u2019re purchasing from licensed or private dealers, she said. (Other research also shows this.)\n\nUnlike Everytown, Ms. Zeoli also looked at state domestic violence laws, poverty and divorce rates, average amounts of public assistance, educational attainment gaps between men and women, homicides not related to domestic violence, percentage of suicides by firearms as a proxy for gun ownership rates and law enforcement availability.\n\n\u201cThose are areas where there are no guns. The reason I carry a concealed firearm everywhere I go is because I don\u2019t know where those gun-free zones are, that I may walking through at the mall, or at the doughnut shop, or wherever I might be.\u201d \u2014 Representative John Rutherford, Republican of Florida\n\nThis needs context.\n\nAs Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Trump discussed concealed-carry laws, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed concealed in a gun-free zone.\u201d The exchange highlights how amorphous the term \u201cgun-free zone\u201d has become.\n\nFederal law prohibits firearms in grade schools, but makes explicit exceptions for security personnel and instructional purposes (hunting classes, for example). So, Mr. Rutherford is wrong to state that there are never guns in \u201cgun-free zones.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, at least eight states allow concealed carry for teachers at grade schools, and two others have eased restrictions, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group.\n\nPrivate businesses may also ban civilian use of firearms on their premises, but state laws vary on how and on the extent to which a business can opt out.\n\nTexas has very specific requirements for the signs businesses put up to indicate that they do not allow firearms on their properties. (For example, they must be in both English and Spanish.) North Carolina requires signs to be \u201cconspicuous,\u201d while Florida has no explicit rules. Florida is one of 23 states that require business owners to allow guns in cars parked on company property.\n\n\u201cPeople just want to dismiss concealed-carry permits. They do actually increase safety.\u201d \u2014 Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nWhen asked what data Mr. Scalise was referring to, a spokesman told The Times, \u201cSince the early \u201990s, the significant increase in the issuance of concealed-carry permits by states has been accompanied by a significant drop in violent crime rates \u2014 and that includes millions of new permits being issued in the last decade or so.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman cited the work of John R. Lott Jr., an economist and gun rights advocate whose book \u201cMore Guns, Less Crime\u201d makes the case that \u201cpassing concealed-handgun laws deters violent crime.\u201d But Mr. Lott\u2019s findings have been questioned by other academics.\n\nIn 2005, a panel at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that \u201cno link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have reached an opposite conclusion. In a 2017 study, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, found that states that adopted right-to-carry laws saw an increase in violent crime.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

The Coast Guard falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department.\n\nLast year, the Coast Guard seized a record 455,000 pounds of cocaine, some by patrolling waters off the coasts of Colombia and Peru, worth over $7.2 billion wholesale. It also arrested more than 600 drug traffickers and captured nearly 3,500 people trying to enter the country illegally.\n\nThe Coast Guard also rescued nearly 12,000 people after deadly hurricanes hit the East Coast, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Known primarily for its role in search-and-rescue missions, the Coast Guard has in recent years taken on missions around the world that include guarding the president and even cybersecurity.\n\nBut for years, the Coast Guard has suffered even as its mission has expanded, in part because of its image as a service that towed ships or searched for people lost at sea. Another issue has been a lack of funding. The Coast Guard does not receive any additional money from Congress for its work in areas such as disaster relief.\n\nThe Trump administration, in addition to moving to increase the Coast Guard\u2019s budget, has lavished praise on the service.\n\nDuring a celebration of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s 15th anniversary on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence singled out the Coast Guard. \u201cThe men and women of the Coast Guard have inspired the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s relationship with the Coast Guard has also been frayed.\n\nThe initial Trump White House spending plan would have cut the Coast Guard\u2019s funding by 14 percent, or about $1.3 billion, to help pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. The other military services \u2014 the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps \u2014 all saw funding increases.\n\nThe administration reversed itself and increased the Coast Guard\u2019s budget request to, among other things, build a new Arctic icebreaker for the first time in 40 years as the United States competes with Russia and China in the polar region.\n\nThe vessel will not be ready until 2023, however, and will be one of only two such ships that the United States is operating. By comparison, Russia has 40 icebreakers and 11 more in production.\n\n\u201cRussia has really been asserting itself in the Arctic, and we\u2019ve been asserting ourselves with paper, with reports,\u201d Admiral Zukunft said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdmiral Zukunft has not been shy about challenging the administration: Last year, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter his intent to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, Admiral Zukunft said in a speech that same day that he would continue to support transgender troops under his command.", "keywords": ["challenges", "homeland", "administration", "departing", "guards", "zukunft", "commandant", "trump", "continue", "states", "drug", "united", "guard", "lays", "successes", "coast"], "polarity": 0.04913023088023087, "subjectivity": 0.3420624098124099},

(Mr. Farage gets some precious face time and a photo-op with the president this week, too, backstage at CPAC.) Curiously, this special relationship has not endeared him to the British establishment in D.C.; when the embassy had a party for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Farage was not among the hundreds who received an invitation, despite the fact that he is in town half a dozen times a year, by his own assessment.\n\nAnd the same month Mr. Trump won the election, he tweeted that Mr. Farage should be named ambassador to the United States, sending the British government into an uproar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m persona non grata,\u201d Mr. Farage said, with some pride. \u201cThe embassy here basically regrets Brexit and Trump. They won\u2019t say so, but they do. It\u2019s obvious.

Image Buckets of steel pipes waiting to be loaded onto a cargo ship in China. American steel producers have long complained about unfair practices. Credit China Network/Reuters\n\nPresident Trump announced today that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, on the grounds that other countries\u2019 trade practices endanger American national security by undermining domestic production. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nIt is simply a tax placed on some particular class of imported goods. If the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price. Tariffs are typically a governmental tool to protect domestic industries and raise revenue.\n\nWait, why did you say \u2018if\u2019 the administration follows through?\n\nThe president made the announcement at an event that was pulled together hastily, and while his preferences were broadly known, some congressional Republicans and business lobbyists were still taken by surprise. By Thursday afternoon, many allies of the president were imploring him to change his mind (the new tariffs are set to go into effect next week).\n\nAlthough President Trump\u2019s criticisms of trading practices by China and other countries have been a hallmark of his years in public life, it appears the details of this policy have not been fully worked through. The White House offered no real implementation details.\n\nWhat is the rationale?\n\nAmerican steel and aluminum companies have long complained of unfair practices by overseas competitors, especially Chinese state subsidies that encourage production. This can flood the global marketplace with metals, depress prices and make American production less economical than it otherwise would be.\n\nAmerican trade officials have sought redress in various ways, including a decision by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 to impose steel tariffs of up to 30 percent. But that was a more narrowly targeted law aimed at safeguarding domestic industries harmed by imports (the Trump administration has used that provision to impose tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines).\n\nThe Trump administration is on more uncharted ground by basing the tariffs on national security concerns \u2014 Section 232 of a law enacted in the Cold War. The argument is that with domestic metals production undermined, the United States is left vulnerable in the event of conflict that disrupts trade flows.\n\nExpect furious lobbying in the days ahead to try to persuade the president to exclude military allies\u2019 metals from the tariffs. Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned that tariffs should be targeted so as not to damage relationships with allies, but it appears the president did not heed that advice.\n\nWho wins and who loses?\n\nThe big winners are the United States steel and aluminum industries, who have lobbied for years for this kind of aggressive government action.\n\nThe most immediate losers are the industries that rely on steel and aluminum as an input and will face higher prices. That includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest industries: the automobile sector; aerospace; heavy equipment; and construction. In short, the chassis of a Ford, the body of a Caterpillar bulldozer, the wings of a Boeing aircraft, and the steel girders inside a New York skyscraper are all about to get more expensive.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s announcement, Wall Street quickly reflected this divide: Shares of U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum were each up about 7 percent shortly afterward, while shares of Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing were each down about 3 percent.\n\nThe industries that use steel and aluminum are considerably larger as a share of the United States economy than are steel and aluminum producers. By one estimate, from Lydia Cox of Harvard and Kadee Russ of the University of California, Davis, steel-using industries employ 80 times as many people as steel-producing industries.\n\nBut what does this mean for consumers?\n\nThe simple answer is that goods containing metals will become more expensive. But there\u2019s not much reason to expect enormous price increases for most goods.\n\nFirst, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel, and the tariff would not apply to domestic production (aluminum is more heavily dependent on imports, with only 10 percent made domestically).\n\nSo prices will go up by only a fraction of the tariff amount. But consumers don\u2019t generally buy raw steel and aluminum. People buy consumer goods in which those raw materials are but one input. A car includes not just steel and aluminum but also plastics and textiles and glass, not to mention the computer circuitry that controls it all, the design know-how and assemblage work, along with a profit margin for both the automaker and the dealer.\n\nFor any given product, it is hard to predict whether producers will eat the cost of more expensive metals, pass the cost on in the form of higher prices, or both. Put differently: If your favorite beer producers are looking at paying an extra fraction of a cent for each aluminum can, they might just take on the cost themselves, they might raise prices, or they might split the difference. It is hard to know in advance how much of each will take place.\n\nSo does this matter for the economy?\n\nThe American economy is relatively strong at the moment, and has been historically resilient to most disruptions. Companies are good at restructuring their supply chains to minimize disruption because of tariffs like these. In most retrospective analyses, the 2002 Bush administration steel tariffs have been judged to be costly relative to the jobs that were saved, but they were hardly the cause of some economic disaster.\n\nThis action may create some jobs in domestic metals-producing industries, cost some jobs in fields where steel and aluminum are inputs, and push consumer prices a bit higher. The large and dynamic United States economy can handle it.\n\nThe risk comes from the potential ripple effects.\n\nAffected countries may well retaliate by ordering tariffs on American goods, and they could carefully target goods to cause economic or political pain. American exporters \u2014 whether they sell passenger airplanes or soybeans \u2014 should be nervous about the next shoe to fall. There are few winners in an all-out trade war like one that enveloped the world economy in the 1930s.\n\nIn particular, the Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security concerns could set a precedent in which China and other nations are willing to use national security as grounds for tariffs, hurting the ability of the World Trade Organization to arbitrate disputes.\n\nThe real risk isn\u2019t that steel and aluminum are a bit more expensive, though that is likely to be the case. It\u2019s that an entire system of global trade, which the United States helped build, might be undermined.\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

Trump Jr. about a 2016 meeting with Russian officials has drawn attention from federal investigators. On Tuesday, she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee and made headlines for admitting that she had sometimes told fibs as part of her job.\n\nLast month, the man she had been dating, the former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, was accused by his former wives of domestic abuse, sparking an ongoing scandal that offered a glimpse of her closely guarded personal life and drew paparazzi to her apartment building. There were rumblings that Mr. Trump questioned Ms. Hicks\u2019s judgment after the White House initially defended Mr. Porter, although a bevy of administration officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, later vouched for Ms. Hicks in on-the-record interviews.\n\nMs. Hicks had stopped monitoring news coverage of herself, restricting her television intake to Fox News, which she often watched on mute, assuming that the Trump-friendly network would rarely include her name on its chyrons.\n\nFriends who reached out to her, offering support or guidance, acknowledged that Ms. Hicks had been distressed. But they also received text messages from her in which she declared that she was tougher than people assumed.\n\nMs. Hicks\u2019s career followed a curious trajectory. As a young model, she appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks and in Ralph Lauren catalogs before going to work for Ms. Trump\u2019s apparel and licensing brand. Even after she had begun serving as an Oval Office gatekeeper, she maintained a low public profile, which fueled the fascination \u2014 and sometimes disdain \u2014 of those who watch national politics closely.\n\nEmily Nussbaum, The New Yorker\u2019s television critic, often tweeted whimsically about Ms. Hicks, calling her an \u201cIt Girl.\u201d (Ms. Hicks was once the face of a \u201cGossip Girl\u201d-spinoff book series called \u201cIt Girl.\u201d) Others dismissed her as a mere factotum, especially after a report that she was once tasked during the campaign with steaming Mr. Trump\u2019s suits, sometimes while he was wearing them. On Wednesday, after news of Ms. Hicks\u2019s exit was announced, the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino tweeted: \u201cGoodbye to Hope Hicks, an object lesson in the quickest way a woman can advance under misogyny: silence, beauty, and unconditional deference to men.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, however, Ms. Hicks\u2019s success was viewed as a product of other qualities, including her nuanced understanding of Mr. Trump\u2019s moods, her ability to subtly nudge him away from his coarser impulses and her skill as a liaison for some of the most prominent journalists in the country.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Often, she could single-handedly arrange time with the easily distracted president. At a Paley Center panel discussion on Wednesday, the NBC News anchor Lester Holt described Ms. Hicks as his first contact for coordinating his interview with Mr. Trump last May. \u201cShe was quite helpful,\u201d Mr. Holt said.\n\nAnd in an administration riven by infighting, Ms. Hicks\u2019s privileged position with the president meant that, for journalists, she was among the few officials whose information was deemed reliable, or at least not often compromised by personal squabbles.\n\nOf course, she always advocated for her boss, lamenting that reporters did not see the empathetic and charming Mr. Trump whom she said she knew.\n\nMs. Hicks, a reluctant \u00e9migr\u00e9 to insular Washington, kept a tiny circle of confidants, complaining that she could not trust anyone in a company town. She frequently visited family in Connecticut and friends in New York, where she felt she could comfortably walk down the street without being accosted or asked for a favor.\n\nShe has told friends that, for now, she has no definite ideas for her life after the West Wing, except that she will not be living in Washington. An extended vacation with her family is planned. Book agents have come calling, but Ms. Hicks has told acquaintances that she is reluctant to write anything \u2014 although she has joked that a massive advance could change her mind.\n\n\u201cI think she would benefit from taking a minute or two to get some perspective on all of this,\u201d said Michael Feldman, a Clinton White House veteran who is a family friend of Ms. Hicks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about Hope,\u201d Mr. Feldman added, echoing other friends interviewed for this article. \u201cI fully expect her to land on her feet.\u201d\n\nThose confident in Ms. Hicks\u2019s future prospects sounded more concerned about Mr. Trump and his ability to work without an aide he has relied on nearly every day for three years.\n\n\u201cThis is not losing a staffer,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cThis is like losing a limb.\u201d", "keywords": ["losing", "limb", "york", "washington", "hope", "hicks", "departure", "trump", "ms", "white", "trumps", "hickss", "house", "mr"], "polarity": 0.073113106511544, "subjectivity": 0.3874954906204906},

And local districts have varied their approach to arming educators \u2014 in Ohio, guns are kept in safes; in Texas, they can be worn in holsters or kept in safes within immediate reach.\n\nA Florida state legislative committee approved a $67 million \u201cschool marshal\u201d program this week to train and arm teachers \u2014 over the vocal opposition of Parkland residents.\n\nIn Texas, some public school systems have been quietly arming teachers and administrators for more than a decade. Teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to undergo specialized training receive approval to either carry a concealed firearm in school or have one within reach.\n\nPhoto\n\nLawmakers, educators and advocates for gun rights said Texas\u2019 school marshal and school guardian programs have eased fears of armed intruders and have not led to any firearm accidents or mishaps. The state\u2019s programs could serve as a model for schools around the country, advocates say.\n\nOne rural district, Harrold Independent School District, has been allowing armed personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds as part of its guardian program since 2007, one year after a shooting at an Amish school in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis clearly is the solution to the problem that we\u2019re seeing around the country, and I think the president has recognized that,\u201d said State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican who wrote the law that established the school-marshal program.\n\nAt a meeting at the White House with other governors on Monday, Gov.

Uniformed, armed officers cost $200,000 a year, and an insurance policy of $100,000 a year includes coverage for its staff with access to firearms.

Its members are required to attend a concealed weapons course, as well as additional monthly trainings at either the firing range where they practice marksmanship and in school-based simulations where they practice in the hallways, identifying threats and eliminating them with air guns.\n\nSince the team was created, it has responded to one incident, this past August when a student brought a gun to school in his backpack.

Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.\n\nThis past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201d\n\nAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.\n\nThe global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\n\n\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201d\n\nOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.\n\nMr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201d\n\nEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.\n\nThere was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.\n\nThe pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.\n\nCarbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201d\n\nStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.\n\nMany environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.\n\nThe tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.\n\nIn the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign.

As a member of the State Department\u2019s Civil Service \u2014 as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats \u2014 it was highly unusual for Mrs. Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico.\n\nBut Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama named Mrs. Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed.

Mr. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month.\n\nWhile Mr. Shannon said his decision had been made for personal reasons, the departure of another official, John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama, was more politically tinged. In his resignation letter this year, Mr. Feeley said he was leaving a long career in the government service because he felt he could no longer serve Mr. Trump.\n\nIn her letter to staff, Mrs. Jacobson focused mostly on the work she and her team had done during her tenure, and did not take any shots at the president.\n\n\u201cYou have respected everyone you came in contact with \u2014 Mexican, American, or from anywhere else, reflecting the better angels of our nature,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know how great our two countries are.

Bush set up an F.B.I. task force to focus on MS-13 in 2004 and created the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2005. MS-13 became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization when President Barack Obama did so in 2012.\n\nMr. Sessions has compared MS-13 to Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia. The gang is now a top target of the Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, which has historically focused on major drug traffickers and money launderers with its annual $500 million budget. The department\u2019s budget proposal for next year also requests $400,000 for a \u201csensitive investigative unit\u201d to address transnational threats from El Salvador.\n\nThe United States and foreign allies have issued charges against 4,000 members of MS-13, Mr. Sessions said earlier this month. In December, he announced 40 new assistant United States attorney positions across the country to fight MS-13 and other gangs, including two on Long Island and three in Maryland.\n\nOne official at a United States attorney\u2019s office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was troubled by new pressure on MS-13 cases, given skyrocketing opioid crimes and a growing national human trafficking problem.\n\nEven so, the number of federal prosecutions against MS-13 in the United States is limited. Only 11 cases were brought between October 2016 and September 2017, according to data provided by the Justice Department. Since then, prosecutors have opened another 13 cases.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis week, Mr. Sessions told state attorneys general he wanted to work with them in local prosecutions against MS-13. \u201cWe\u2019re coming after MS-13. We want to hammer them,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators arrested 796 suspected members of MS-13 last year, up from 429 in 2016. The agency said it also deported about 5,300 suspected members of all gangs over that same period of time, up from 2,000. Over a three-month span last fall, an I.C.E. operation dubbed \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d swept up 214 MS-13 members nationwide and arrested an additional 53 in El Salvador.\n\nIn New York, F.B.I. agents have grumbled about having to focus on MS-13, according to a senior bureau official; there have been worries that agents have arrested members of Trinitario, a Dominican gang, but characterized them as MS-13 members to inflate their arrest totals to meet expectations, a senior state law enforcement official said. Neither official was authorized to speak publicly and both spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cAny claim that we are mischaracterizing gang members to inflate our arrest totals is false,\u201d an F.B.I. spokeswoman, Nora Scheland, said in a statement. The F.B.I. cracks down on all gang activity as part of its work to combat violent crime, she said.\n\nA $500,000 Justice Department grant promised in October to fight gang violence and gun crime in Suffolk County, N.Y., targeted not only MS-13 but also the Bloods and Crips in its crime analysis. The Long Island county, which applied for the grant, was one of 14 awarded for a total of $3.375 million. Officials say they have not yet received the grant.\n\nTimothy D. Sini, the Suffolk County district attorney and former police commissioner, said MS-13 \u201cconstitutes a significant public safety threat\u201d and was responsible for 17 murders in 15 months in that area of Long Island.\n\n\u201cWith that said,\u201d Mr. Sini said, \u201cthe No.1 public health and safety issue facing Suffolk County, as in other communities, is the drug epidemic. And this drug epidemic is a moving target.\u201d He said opioid overdoses killed more than 300 people in Suffolk County last year, compared with six deaths linked to MS-13.\n\nPhoto\n\nA two-year uptick in violent activity converged with the arrival of more than 4,700 school-age minors in Suffolk County since 2013. Many of the children were fleeing gang violence in their native El Salvador or Honduras, and, after entering the country, most often applied for asylum, or the protection known as Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.\n\nLast March, federal authorities charged 13 young adults \u2014 including four accused of involvement in the killings of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens \u2014 linked to MS-13 with racketeering and other crimes in Suffolk County. Of the 13, 10 were unauthorized immigrants, federal prosecutors said. Seven had come to the country as unaccompanied minors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly sought to show that immigration programs it is trying to eliminate have allowed MS-13 and other gangs to flourish. It has singled out the nation\u2019s diversity lottery system, immigration programs to allow unaccompanied minors to cross the border and deportation protections for people who were brought illegally to the United States as children.\n\nYet the latest numbers do not bear that out. According to Border Patrol apprehension statistics published in December, the number of MS-13 members caught at the border actually declined to 228 in 2017, from 437 in 2014.\n\nSome law enforcement officials privately fear that the Trump administration\u2019s push to eradicate crime by deporting illegal immigrants could backfire.\n\nImmigrants in communities where MS-13 is the strongest may be reluctant to come forward with information to help investigations, fearing deportation themselves. Some fear the government will use MS-13 cases to identify the gang members\u2019 relatives and deport them. And MS-13\u2019s victims are overwhelmingly immigrants themselves.\n\n\u201cThe administration is using MS-13 in Willy Horton-esque campaign ads and as cover to make a boogeyman out of immigration,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a California state senator. \u201cIt is using MS-13 as a pretext to go after hardworking immigrants.\u201d", "keywords": ["county", "ms13", "suffolk", "enforcement", "immigration", "gang", "according", "members", "targets", "trump", "violent", "states", "drug", "portrays", "menace"], "polarity": 0.02921006542140563, "subjectivity": 0.3896137653869613},

Like the Baha\u2019i, Mandeans, who follow the teachings of John the Baptist, lack even the nominal protections of the Iranian Constitution and are thus particularly vulnerable to persecution and pressure to convert to Islam.\n\nAmong the Mandeans marooned in Vienna are three relatives of Peiman Khamisi of Batavia, Ill., who arrived through the Lautenberg Amendment nine years ago. In Iran, his relatives pretended to be Muslim to avoid harassment, performed religious rites in secret and were denied access to higher education, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The reason: Parts suppliers have a particular incentive to push for cleaner standards, experts say, because tougher emissions rules would spur automakers to fill their vehicles with new, more efficient technologies, and the parts makers would profit from developing that equipment.\n\nNexteer Automotive, for example, makes steering systems that are powered by electricity and not the vehicle\u2019s engine, greatly reducing fuel consumption.

But he then said law enforcement should \u201ctake the guns first, go through due process second\u201d when dealing with people who own guns and exhibit signs of mental illness.\n\nThe president also repeatedly chastised lawmakers for being \u201cafraid\u201d and \u201cpetrified\u201d of the National Rifle Association, which he then also praised as filled with \u201cgreat patriots\u201d who are \u201cwell meaning.\u201d\n\nHere are some other comments by Mr. Trump during the session, fact-checked:\n\n\u201cYou take Pulse nightclub, if you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn\u2019t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThere was, in fact, an off-duty police officer working in the nightclub at the time of the shooting. Officer Adam Gruler, a member of the Orlando Police Department since 2001, responded and exchanged fire with the gunman.\n\n\u201cTexas, as an example, is very much as to what I\u2019m saying. You\u2019ve done very well. You haven\u2019t had this problem.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nSeveral mass shootings have occurred in Texas.\n\nSome recent examples: in November, a gunman opened fire on a church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people. In July 2016, a sniper gunned down police officers in Dallas, leaving five dead. And in 2014, a soldier killed three others at Fort Hood in Killeen.\n\n\u201c98 percent of all mass shootings in the United States since 1950 have taken place in gun-free zones.\u201d\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to a 2014 study from John Lott, an economist and gun rights advocate.\n\nMr. Lott found that 98.4 percent of mass public shootings have occurred in a \u201cgun free zone.\u201d His study looked at shootings that occurred in areas where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, as well as places that \u201cmade it extremely difficult\u201d to obtain a concealed carry license.\n\nOther researchers have criticized or directly refuted Mr. Lott\u2019s work as too broad.\n\nFor instance, in his 2016 book, \u201cRampage Nation,\u201d Louis Klarevas of the University of Massachusetts Boston criticized Mr. Lott\u2019s definition of \u201cgun free zones\u201d and argued that the absence of conceal-carry laws does not equate to \u201cgun free.\u201d Such laws fail to account for weapons being carried by law enforcement officers, military troops or licensed professional security personnel.\n\nMr. Klaveras also pointed out that Mr. Lott\u2019s data set included military bases like Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard, where weapons are kept on site and held according to military protocol.\n\nUsing his own data set of 111 mass shootings since 1966, Mr. Klarevas found that 84 percent took place in areas where civilians were allowed to carry guns. Similarly, the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety found that 70 percent of mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015 took place in private residences.\n\nEliminating gun-free zones \u201cprevent it from ever happening, because they are cowards and they\u2019re not going in when they know they\u2019re going to come out dead.\u201d\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nFear of death or returning fire has not deterred several mass shooters in recent years. For example, perpetrators of mass shootings in Las Vegas in 2017, Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 all committed suicide.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

If the United States chooses to take a more punitive approach, \u201cthen I think we are at the brink of heading for a more Cold War-type relationship,\u201d she added.\n\nMr. Liu has been dispatched to Washington to evaluate the likelihood of such a clash, as well as to try to defuse tensions. He plans to tell American officials about areas where the Chinese economy will be opening up and push for an official commitment to restore economic meetings between the two countries, which stalled after a falling-out over trade in July.\n\nMr. Liu was scheduled to meet with a handful of top executives from American companies and organizations on Wednesday, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock; David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs; Marc Allen of Boeing; Evan Greenberg of Chubb; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; and Thomas J. Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Liu and a Chinese delegation will jointly meet with top administration officials including Gary D.

Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a \u201cfrank exchange of views on the trade and economic relationship,\u201d a White House official said. Mr. Liu will not meet with the president himself.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides, including Mr. Lighthizer, have discouraged the president from engaging with China. It has been a shift from Mr. Trump\u2019s first months in office, when he warmly received Mr. Xi at Mar-a-Lago and started a new \u201cComprehensive Economic Dialogue\u201d between the countries that would include 100 days of talks over trade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross presented the results of those talks to the president, Mr. Trump, counseled in part by Mr. Lighthizer, concluded the outcome was a bad deal for the United States, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. One of the breakthroughs from the 100 days of talks, China\u2019s agreement to start receiving shipments of American beef, was first promised to the Bush administration. Another deal, to lift caps on foreign investment in Chinese insurance, banking and securities, had already been pledged to President Barack Obama.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Chinese used these dialogues not for meaningful exchanges, but simply to stall American objectives as China\u2019s economic power grows.\n\nThe view underlines a broader shift in the United States strategy toward China from using some carrots to a reliance purely on sticks. Mr. Trump has already jettisoned the primary tool that the Obama administration had been using to encourage China to reform \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The multicountry deal did not include China, but its members said Beijing would be allowed to join after making significant reforms.\n\nSuspicion of China has only grown in recent months. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are united around the prospect of trade measures against China, though they differ on how to tailor those measures so as not to hurt American consumers. In addition, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislation that would crack down on Chinese investments in the United States that could pose a security risk.\n\nThe Trump administration has introduced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules that are aimed at China, and it is soon expected to announce new restrictions on imported aluminum and steel.\n\nIn its 2018 trade policy agenda released Wednesday, the Trump administration criticized China for undermining market competition and distorting markets, behavior it said had left the world poorer overall.\n\n\u201cCountries that refuse to give us reciprocal treatment or who engage in other unfair trading practices will find that we know how to defend our interests,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last few months have been marked by uncertainty, with China experts and Washington trade lawyers expecting tough measures on China to be issued at any time. In return, China has floated retaliation on United States exports of airplanes, sorghum and soybeans.\n\nEconomists say China has fulfilled some of the promises it made to open its economy when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But under Mr. Xi\u2019s guidance, the country has slowed and even reversed some reforms that would reduce the government\u2019s control over the market, tracking by the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Rhodium Group shows.\n\nAmid this retrenchment, business leaders, policymakers and academics who have long defended China against more hawkish views are suddenly changing their tune.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that post-financial crisis, China\u2019s policies and practices have made it more difficult for foreign investors in some sectors of the economy to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThere is a frustration that has been boiling over in recent years that the dialogues have not produced enough tangible results.\u201d\n\nAlthough he stands firmly behind Mr. Xi, the Harvard-educated Mr. Liu has a history of advocating economic reform and more open markets. Mr. Liu is widely thought to be in line for a promotion as China holds a high-profile gathering of top leaders in the coming weeks, potentially to the position of vice premier or to lead the central bank.\n\nExperts on China said Mr. Liu was a familiar figure in the United States, and well-respected by American officials. They put him in the same category as Wang Qishan, another close adviser to Mr. Xi, who is expected to be named vice president.\n\n\u201cIf Wang Qishan and Liu He are special voices in Xi\u2019s ear over the next few years, that\u2019s a good thing for U.S. policy,\u201d said Jeffrey A.

And the number of civilian casualties, the generals were told, would likely be in the thousands or even hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe potential human costs of a war were so high that, at one point during the exercise, General Milley remarked that \u201cthe brutality of this will be beyond the experience of any living soldier,\u201d according to officials who were involved.\n\nSo, too, would be the sheer logistical enterprise of moving thousands of American soldiers and equipment to the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, senior military officials worry that after 17 years in Afghanistan and Iraq, American troops have become far more used to counterinsurgency fighting than a land war against a state, as an attack on North Korea would likely bring.\n\nBut Mr. Mattis also has ordered top Pentagon leaders to be ready for any possible military action against North Korea. Already, ammunition has been pre-staged in the Pacific region for ground units.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cMilitary solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely,\u201d he said in an August post on Twitter \u2014 have left senior officers and rank-and-file troops convinced that they need to accelerate their contingency planning.\n\nA White House decision to attack is almost wholly dependent on cooperation from South Korea \u2014 not only in committing its troops or other assets to the battle but also accepting the risk of widespread bloodshed on its civilian population if the North fires back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith a revival recently signaled on the long-dormant diplomatic track to resolve the Korean crisis, Pentagon officials said they did not want to disrupt any chance for a negotiated resolution.

All 31 Americans aboard were killed in the attack by two North Korean MiGs.\n\nAt the time, President Richard M. Nixon chose not to retaliate.

They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold.

Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers.

But a few months later, the company began carrying the firearms at its outdoor and hunting retail chain, Field & Stream.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent.\n\nMr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to be a part of this any longer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat response raised rounds of discussions with the company\u2019s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said.\n\nHe said Dick\u2019s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting.\n\nBut when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a part of a mass shooting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company said that it had not decided what to do with ts inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace.\n\nLegal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick\u2019s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court.\n\nAdam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick\u2019s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick\u2019s,\u201d Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions.\n\nThe company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately.", "keywords": ["rifles", "buyers", "raise", "decision", "school", "dicks", "company", "minimum", "21", "walmart", "mr", "age", "gun", "stack", "social"], "polarity": 0.07284666391809248, "subjectivity": 0.3701934309077165},

Image President Trump and Senator Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday at the White House. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump discussed potential solutions to curb gun violence on Wednesday during a televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.\n\nThe president strayed from the facts during his remarks, as The New York Times reported previously. Here is a look at the claims made during the session by other lawmakers \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 that may have strayed from the facts or otherwise require some additional context.\n\n\u201cThis is when the 10-year assault weapon ban was in \u2014 how incidents and deaths dropped. When it ended, you see it going up.\u201d \u2014 Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThis needs context.\n\nIn the past, Ms. Feinstein has referenced an analysis by Louis Klarevas, a lecturer at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that found the assault weapons ban drastically reduced gun massacres.\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult to directly link declines in crime or gun violence to any specific law, given the limited scope and loopholes in each one, according to most experts and research.\n\nAs The Times has previously reported:\n\nThe 1994 ban on assault weapons has become a particular and recent subject of intense debate. The N.R.A. has cited a 2004 analysis funded by the Justice Department to argue that the \u201cban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.\u201d On the other hand, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has claimed in a Twitter post that \u201cthe number of gun massacres fell by 37%\u201d while the ban was in place. Christopher Koper, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the lead author of the study that is cited by the N.R.A., has repeatedly said that the ban had mixed effects and final results would not be immediately evident. \u201cMy work is often cited in misleading ways that don\u2019t give the full picture,\u201d Mr. Koper said Thursday in an email. \u201cThese laws can modestly reduce shootings overall\u201d and reduce the number and severity of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cThese shooters typically are males. They\u2019re white and they\u2019re suicidal.\u201d \u2014 Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana\n\nTrue.\n\nA database maintained by Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, shows that 95 out of 97 mass shootings from 1982 to 2018 involved male gunmen. Fifty-five were committed by white men.\n\n\u201cThe states that have these background checks, they have a 38 percent lower domestic homicide rate \u2014 this is domestic violence.\u201d \u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota\n\nCausation is not clear.\n\nMs. Klobuchar is probably referring to a report from Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, that claims \u201c38 percent fewer women\u201d are \u201cshot to death by intimate partners\u201d in states that require background checks for all handgun sales.\n\nThis analysis, however, does not account for other factors that contribute to domestic violence, leading other researchers to question the sweeping conclusion about background checks.\n\nApril Zeoli, a professor at Michigan State University who studies intimate partner violence, called the Everytown estimate a \u201cback of the napkin\u201d calculation.\n\nMs. Zeoli\u2019s research has found that state laws restricting access to firearms for people who have been convicted of domestic violence result in declines in intimate partner homicides; specifically, 11 percent from laws that mandate buyers to get a permit whether they\u2019re purchasing from licensed or private dealers, she said. (Other research also shows this.)\n\nUnlike Everytown, Ms. Zeoli also looked at state domestic violence laws, poverty and divorce rates, average amounts of public assistance, educational attainment gaps between men and women, homicides not related to domestic violence, percentage of suicides by firearms as a proxy for gun ownership rates and law enforcement availability.\n\n\u201cThose are areas where there are no guns. The reason I carry a concealed firearm everywhere I go is because I don\u2019t know where those gun-free zones are, that I may walking through at the mall, or at the doughnut shop, or wherever I might be.\u201d \u2014 Representative John Rutherford, Republican of Florida\n\nThis needs context.\n\nAs Mr. Rutherford and Mr. Trump discussed concealed-carry laws, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed concealed in a gun-free zone.\u201d The exchange highlights how amorphous the term \u201cgun-free zone\u201d has become.\n\nFederal law prohibits firearms in grade schools, but makes explicit exceptions for security personnel and instructional purposes (hunting classes, for example). So, Mr. Rutherford is wrong to state that there are never guns in \u201cgun-free zones.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, at least eight states allow concealed carry for teachers at grade schools, and two others have eased restrictions, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group.\n\nPrivate businesses may also ban civilian use of firearms on their premises, but state laws vary on how and on the extent to which a business can opt out.\n\nTexas has very specific requirements for the signs businesses put up to indicate that they do not allow firearms on their properties. (For example, they must be in both English and Spanish.) North Carolina requires signs to be \u201cconspicuous,\u201d while Florida has no explicit rules. Florida is one of 23 states that require business owners to allow guns in cars parked on company property.\n\n\u201cPeople just want to dismiss concealed-carry permits. They do actually increase safety.\u201d \u2014 Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nWhen asked what data Mr. Scalise was referring to, a spokesman told The Times, \u201cSince the early \u201990s, the significant increase in the issuance of concealed-carry permits by states has been accompanied by a significant drop in violent crime rates \u2014 and that includes millions of new permits being issued in the last decade or so.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman cited the work of John R. Lott Jr., an economist and gun rights advocate whose book \u201cMore Guns, Less Crime\u201d makes the case that \u201cpassing concealed-handgun laws deters violent crime.\u201d But Mr. Lott\u2019s findings have been questioned by other academics.\n\nIn 2005, a panel at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded that \u201cno link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data, even in the initial sample.\u201d\n\nOther researchers have reached an opposite conclusion. In a 2017 study, John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School, found that states that adopted right-to-carry laws saw an increase in violent crime.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

The Coast Guard falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department.\n\nLast year, the Coast Guard seized a record 455,000 pounds of cocaine, some by patrolling waters off the coasts of Colombia and Peru, worth over $7.2 billion wholesale. It also arrested more than 600 drug traffickers and captured nearly 3,500 people trying to enter the country illegally.\n\nThe Coast Guard also rescued nearly 12,000 people after deadly hurricanes hit the East Coast, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Known primarily for its role in search-and-rescue missions, the Coast Guard has in recent years taken on missions around the world that include guarding the president and even cybersecurity.\n\nBut for years, the Coast Guard has suffered even as its mission has expanded, in part because of its image as a service that towed ships or searched for people lost at sea. Another issue has been a lack of funding. The Coast Guard does not receive any additional money from Congress for its work in areas such as disaster relief.\n\nThe Trump administration, in addition to moving to increase the Coast Guard\u2019s budget, has lavished praise on the service.\n\nDuring a celebration of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s 15th anniversary on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence singled out the Coast Guard. \u201cThe men and women of the Coast Guard have inspired the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s relationship with the Coast Guard has also been frayed.\n\nThe initial Trump White House spending plan would have cut the Coast Guard\u2019s funding by 14 percent, or about $1.3 billion, to help pay for Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall. The other military services \u2014 the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps \u2014 all saw funding increases.\n\nThe administration reversed itself and increased the Coast Guard\u2019s budget request to, among other things, build a new Arctic icebreaker for the first time in 40 years as the United States competes with Russia and China in the polar region.\n\nThe vessel will not be ready until 2023, however, and will be one of only two such ships that the United States is operating. By comparison, Russia has 40 icebreakers and 11 more in production.\n\n\u201cRussia has really been asserting itself in the Arctic, and we\u2019ve been asserting ourselves with paper, with reports,\u201d Admiral Zukunft said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdmiral Zukunft has not been shy about challenging the administration: Last year, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter his intent to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, Admiral Zukunft said in a speech that same day that he would continue to support transgender troops under his command.", "keywords": ["challenges", "homeland", "administration", "departing", "guards", "zukunft", "commandant", "trump", "continue", "states", "drug", "united", "guard", "lays", "successes", "coast"], "polarity": 0.04913023088023087, "subjectivity": 0.3420624098124099},

(Mr. Farage gets some precious face time and a photo-op with the president this week, too, backstage at CPAC.) Curiously, this special relationship has not endeared him to the British establishment in D.C.; when the embassy had a party for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Farage was not among the hundreds who received an invitation, despite the fact that he is in town half a dozen times a year, by his own assessment.\n\nAnd the same month Mr. Trump won the election, he tweeted that Mr. Farage should be named ambassador to the United States, sending the British government into an uproar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m persona non grata,\u201d Mr. Farage said, with some pride. \u201cThe embassy here basically regrets Brexit and Trump. They won\u2019t say so, but they do. It\u2019s obvious. So the idea that the British embassy would not talk to me given my relationship with the president and with the people around him is, I do not necessarily think, in our national interest. But others can make their own minds up about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe agreed that foreign relations between the White House and 10 Downing Street, the headquarters of British government, have only grown frostier in recent months. But not because of Mr. Trump, he insisted.\n\n\u201cHe has reached out, he\u2019s offered the hand of friendship, and frankly we\u2019ve spurned him,\u201d Mr. Farage said.

It\u2019s certainly widespread, though: During Mr. Trump\u2019s first month in office, a petition to block him from making his first official state visit to England was signed more than a million times, at one point by more than a thousand people per minute.\n\nIf it were up to Mr. Farage, he would circumvent the British government entirely, rent out Wembley Stadium, invite Mr. Trump to speak, charge 20 pounds a ticket and donate the proceeds to charity.\n\n\u201cKnockout,\u201d he said gleefully. \u201cAre people going to protest against raising money for charity? They can if they want to!\u201d\n\nBack home, the political party that Mr. Farage headed for years and used to orchestrate Brexit, UKIP, voted last week to oust its leader, Henry Bolton, after it was revealed that his girlfriend had made racist remarks about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s bride-to-be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Mr. Farage said, shaking his head angrily. \u201cI think Meghan Markle adds glamour and sparkle to the royal family.\u201d He thinks the royal wedding, and the fact that Ms. Markle is American, will be good for the country. \u201cHarry is regarded as Mr. Cool, and it further strengthens the Anglo-American relationship, so it gets ticks from me all the way around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Farage\u2019s staunchest supporters have called for him to again lead UKIP, once referred to by David Cameron, the former British prime minister, as the party of \u201cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists.\u201d (Mr. Farage considers this his very own \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d moment.)\n\nPhoto\n\nWould he consider running the party again? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, flatly, claiming he has aged out of party politics.\n\nStill, Mr. Farage retained enough vim to travel in September to Alabama to join an old friend, Steve Bannon, and campaign for Roy Moore in the special Senate election. The accompanying Breitbart headline read: \u201cBrexit Hero Farage in Alabama: Judge Roy Moore \u2018Not Going to Be Sucked Into the Swamp.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Bannon was quoted accusing Donald Trump Jr. of treason in the book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d he was defenestrated from the tallest tower of castle Breitbart and denounced on the The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page by the right-wing megadonor Rebekah Mercer, whose father, Robert, reportedly has ties to Mr. Farage. (He refuses to elaborate on this relationship.)\n\nMr. Farage still speaks positively about Mr. Bannon but says that he has not talked to him since his ouster from Trumpworld. \u201cThings have gone rather wrong in the last few months,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Farage says he doesn\u2019t regret throwing his support behind Mr. Moore and grows testy when pressed on this. \u201cAll my staff know I\u2019ve got what I call the \u2018seven out of 10 rule.\u2019 As long as I\u2019m right seven times out of 10 in politics, it will be O.K.

Image Buckets of steel pipes waiting to be loaded onto a cargo ship in China. American steel producers have long complained about unfair practices. Credit China Network/Reuters\n\nPresident Trump announced today that his administration would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, on the grounds that other countries\u2019 trade practices endanger American national security by undermining domestic production. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is a tariff?\n\nIt is simply a tax placed on some particular class of imported goods. If the Trump administration follows through on the president\u2019s comments Thursday, a company bringing $100,000 of steel made in Canada into the United States would have to pay $25,000 to the government, effectively increasing its price. Tariffs are typically a governmental tool to protect domestic industries and raise revenue.\n\nWait, why did you say \u2018if\u2019 the administration follows through?\n\nThe president made the announcement at an event that was pulled together hastily, and while his preferences were broadly known, some congressional Republicans and business lobbyists were still taken by surprise. By Thursday afternoon, many allies of the president were imploring him to change his mind (the new tariffs are set to go into effect next week).\n\nAlthough President Trump\u2019s criticisms of trading practices by China and other countries have been a hallmark of his years in public life, it appears the details of this policy have not been fully worked through. The White House offered no real implementation details.\n\nWhat is the rationale?\n\nAmerican steel and aluminum companies have long complained of unfair practices by overseas competitors, especially Chinese state subsidies that encourage production. This can flood the global marketplace with metals, depress prices and make American production less economical than it otherwise would be.\n\nAmerican trade officials have sought redress in various ways, including a decision by the George W. Bush administration in 2002 to impose steel tariffs of up to 30 percent. But that was a more narrowly targeted law aimed at safeguarding domestic industries harmed by imports (the Trump administration has used that provision to impose tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines).\n\nThe Trump administration is on more uncharted ground by basing the tariffs on national security concerns \u2014 Section 232 of a law enacted in the Cold War. The argument is that with domestic metals production undermined, the United States is left vulnerable in the event of conflict that disrupts trade flows.\n\nExpect furious lobbying in the days ahead to try to persuade the president to exclude military allies\u2019 metals from the tariffs. Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned that tariffs should be targeted so as not to damage relationships with allies, but it appears the president did not heed that advice.\n\nWho wins and who loses?\n\nThe big winners are the United States steel and aluminum industries, who have lobbied for years for this kind of aggressive government action.\n\nThe most immediate losers are the industries that rely on steel and aluminum as an input and will face higher prices. That includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest industries: the automobile sector; aerospace; heavy equipment; and construction. In short, the chassis of a Ford, the body of a Caterpillar bulldozer, the wings of a Boeing aircraft, and the steel girders inside a New York skyscraper are all about to get more expensive.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s announcement, Wall Street quickly reflected this divide: Shares of U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum were each up about 7 percent shortly afterward, while shares of Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing were each down about 3 percent.\n\nThe industries that use steel and aluminum are considerably larger as a share of the United States economy than are steel and aluminum producers. By one estimate, from Lydia Cox of Harvard and Kadee Russ of the University of California, Davis, steel-using industries employ 80 times as many people as steel-producing industries.\n\nBut what does this mean for consumers?\n\nThe simple answer is that goods containing metals will become more expensive. But there\u2019s not much reason to expect enormous price increases for most goods.\n\nFirst, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel, and the tariff would not apply to domestic production (aluminum is more heavily dependent on imports, with only 10 percent made domestically).\n\nSo prices will go up by only a fraction of the tariff amount. But consumers don\u2019t generally buy raw steel and aluminum. People buy consumer goods in which those raw materials are but one input. A car includes not just steel and aluminum but also plastics and textiles and glass, not to mention the computer circuitry that controls it all, the design know-how and assemblage work, along with a profit margin for both the automaker and the dealer.\n\nFor any given product, it is hard to predict whether producers will eat the cost of more expensive metals, pass the cost on in the form of higher prices, or both. Put differently: If your favorite beer producers are looking at paying an extra fraction of a cent for each aluminum can, they might just take on the cost themselves, they might raise prices, or they might split the difference. It is hard to know in advance how much of each will take place.\n\nSo does this matter for the economy?\n\nThe American economy is relatively strong at the moment, and has been historically resilient to most disruptions. Companies are good at restructuring their supply chains to minimize disruption because of tariffs like these. In most retrospective analyses, the 2002 Bush administration steel tariffs have been judged to be costly relative to the jobs that were saved, but they were hardly the cause of some economic disaster.\n\nThis action may create some jobs in domestic metals-producing industries, cost some jobs in fields where steel and aluminum are inputs, and push consumer prices a bit higher. The large and dynamic United States economy can handle it.\n\nThe risk comes from the potential ripple effects.\n\nAffected countries may well retaliate by ordering tariffs on American goods, and they could carefully target goods to cause economic or political pain. American exporters \u2014 whether they sell passenger airplanes or soybeans \u2014 should be nervous about the next shoe to fall. There are few winners in an all-out trade war like one that enveloped the world economy in the 1930s.\n\nIn particular, the Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security concerns could set a precedent in which China and other nations are willing to use national security as grounds for tariffs, hurting the ability of the World Trade Organization to arbitrate disputes.\n\nThe real risk isn\u2019t that steel and aluminum are a bit more expensive, though that is likely to be the case. It\u2019s that an entire system of global trade, which the United States helped build, might be undermined.\n\nNeil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot.

Trump Jr. about a 2016 meeting with Russian officials has drawn attention from federal investigators. On Tuesday, she testified for eight hours before the House Intelligence Committee and made headlines for admitting that she had sometimes told fibs as part of her job.\n\nLast month, the man she had been dating, the former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, was accused by his former wives of domestic abuse, sparking an ongoing scandal that offered a glimpse of her closely guarded personal life and drew paparazzi to her apartment building. There were rumblings that Mr. Trump questioned Ms. Hicks\u2019s judgment after the White House initially defended Mr. Porter, although a bevy of administration officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, later vouched for Ms. Hicks in on-the-record interviews.\n\nMs. Hicks had stopped monitoring news coverage of herself, restricting her television intake to Fox News, which she often watched on mute, assuming that the Trump-friendly network would rarely include her name on its chyrons.\n\nFriends who reached out to her, offering support or guidance, acknowledged that Ms. Hicks had been distressed. But they also received text messages from her in which she declared that she was tougher than people assumed.\n\nMs. Hicks\u2019s career followed a curious trajectory. As a young model, she appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks and in Ralph Lauren catalogs before going to work for Ms. Trump\u2019s apparel and licensing brand. Even after she had begun serving as an Oval Office gatekeeper, she maintained a low public profile, which fueled the fascination \u2014 and sometimes disdain \u2014 of those who watch national politics closely.\n\nEmily Nussbaum, The New Yorker\u2019s television critic, often tweeted whimsically about Ms. Hicks, calling her an \u201cIt Girl.\u201d (Ms. Hicks was once the face of a \u201cGossip Girl\u201d-spinoff book series called \u201cIt Girl.\u201d) Others dismissed her as a mere factotum, especially after a report that she was once tasked during the campaign with steaming Mr. Trump\u2019s suits, sometimes while he was wearing them. On Wednesday, after news of Ms. Hicks\u2019s exit was announced, the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino tweeted: \u201cGoodbye to Hope Hicks, an object lesson in the quickest way a woman can advance under misogyny: silence, beauty, and unconditional deference to men.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, however, Ms. Hicks\u2019s success was viewed as a product of other qualities, including her nuanced understanding of Mr. Trump\u2019s moods, her ability to subtly nudge him away from his coarser impulses and her skill as a liaison for some of the most prominent journalists in the country.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Often, she could single-handedly arrange time with the easily distracted president. At a Paley Center panel discussion on Wednesday, the NBC News anchor Lester Holt described Ms. Hicks as his first contact for coordinating his interview with Mr. Trump last May. \u201cShe was quite helpful,\u201d Mr. Holt said.\n\nAnd in an administration riven by infighting, Ms. Hicks\u2019s privileged position with the president meant that, for journalists, she was among the few officials whose information was deemed reliable, or at least not often compromised by personal squabbles.\n\nOf course, she always advocated for her boss, lamenting that reporters did not see the empathetic and charming Mr. Trump whom she said she knew.\n\nMs. Hicks, a reluctant \u00e9migr\u00e9 to insular Washington, kept a tiny circle of confidants, complaining that she could not trust anyone in a company town. She frequently visited family in Connecticut and friends in New York, where she felt she could comfortably walk down the street without being accosted or asked for a favor.\n\nShe has told friends that, for now, she has no definite ideas for her life after the West Wing, except that she will not be living in Washington. An extended vacation with her family is planned. Book agents have come calling, but Ms. Hicks has told acquaintances that she is reluctant to write anything \u2014 although she has joked that a massive advance could change her mind.\n\n\u201cI think she would benefit from taking a minute or two to get some perspective on all of this,\u201d said Michael Feldman, a Clinton White House veteran who is a family friend of Ms. Hicks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t worry about Hope,\u201d Mr. Feldman added, echoing other friends interviewed for this article. \u201cI fully expect her to land on her feet.\u201d\n\nThose confident in Ms. Hicks\u2019s future prospects sounded more concerned about Mr. Trump and his ability to work without an aide he has relied on nearly every day for three years.\n\n\u201cThis is not losing a staffer,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cThis is like losing a limb.\u201d", "keywords": ["losing", "limb", "york", "washington", "hope", "hicks", "departure", "trump", "ms", "white", "trumps", "hickss", "house", "mr"], "polarity": 0.073113106511544, "subjectivity": 0.3874954906204906},

The state\u2019s programs could serve as a model for schools around the country, advocates say.\n\nOne rural district, Harrold Independent School District, has been allowing armed personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds as part of its guardian program since 2007, one year after a shooting at an Amish school in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis clearly is the solution to the problem that we\u2019re seeing around the country, and I think the president has recognized that,\u201d said State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican who wrote the law that established the school-marshal program.\n\nAt a meeting at the White House with other governors on Monday, Gov.

Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet \u201cgreenest governor in America,\u201d sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.\n\nThis past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors\u2019 breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency and the president\u2019s point man in undoing climate change rules. \u201cI told him, you\u2019re killing my state,\u201d Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. \u201cMy state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.\u201d He added, \u201cI told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.\u201d\n\nAn E.P.A. official didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.\n\nThe global interest in Governor Inslee\u2019s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.\n\n\u201cThis is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it\u2019s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,\u201d said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. \u201cIt is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.\u201d\n\nOpponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. \u201cIf it works in the state of Washington, it\u2019s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition. \u201cIf Inslee\u2019s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlready, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.\n\nMr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee\u2019s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. \u201cThis is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cHe is testing out themes and strategies.\u201d\n\nEven if Governor Inslee\u2019s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.\n\nThere was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.\n\nThe pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.\n\nCarbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. \u201cEven Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,\u201d Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is \u201cgoing to find out real quickly that it doesn\u2019t play in Peoria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. \u201cI would like to see him run,\u201d said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. \u201cBut I think it would be the end of him,\u201d he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: \u201cWho is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?\u201d\n\nStill, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.\n\nMany environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.\n\nThe tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington\u2019s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.\n\nIn the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.\n\n\u201cClimate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o\u2019clock evening news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it is a successful and winning issue,\u201d Governor Inslee said.", "keywords": ["climate", "political", "tax", "gamble", "change", "pursues", "win", "governor", "carbon", "state", "inslee", "mr", "washington", "energy"], "polarity": 0.15025426380848067, "subjectivity": 0.4148750847546029},

As a member of the State Department\u2019s Civil Service \u2014 as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats \u2014 it was highly unusual for Mrs. Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico.\n\nBut Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama named Mrs. Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed. After she arrived in Mexico City, the honeymoon period did not last long.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s election abruptly changed the generally warm relations that the United States had developed with Mexico over the last 25 years \u2014 ones that Mrs. Jacobson had helped foster through much of her career. Mrs. Jacobson was left working with her Mexican counterparts to assuage growing concern \u2014 and anger \u2014 at the new president\u2019s tough talk.\n\nAt the same time, diplomacy on Mexico was being routed through the White House, via the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which left Mrs. Jacobson with less authority.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Shannon Jr., the third-highest ranking official in the State Department. Mr. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month.\n\nWhile Mr. Shannon said his decision had been made for personal reasons, the departure of another official, John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama, was more politically tinged. In his resignation letter this year, Mr. Feeley said he was leaving a long career in the government service because he felt he could no longer serve Mr. Trump.\n\nIn her letter to staff, Mrs. Jacobson focused mostly on the work she and her team had done during her tenure, and did not take any shots at the president.\n\n\u201cYou have respected everyone you came in contact with \u2014 Mexican, American, or from anywhere else, reflecting the better angels of our nature,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know how great our two countries are. And that we are stronger together.\u201d\n\nMrs. Jacobson began her career at the State Department as a presidential management intern in 1986, during the Reagan administration, after graduating from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Three years later she was transferred to the Western Hemisphere sector, where she remained for practically the rest of her career.\n\nHer interest in the area stemmed from the embrace of democracy that spread through the region in the 1980s, just as she was leaving college.\n\nShe served in numerous roles in Washington, including as deputy secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs for five years before she moved to Mexico, where she was a key broker in the agreement to re-establish relations between Cuba and the United States during the Obama administration.", "keywords": ["mexico", "career", "service", "ambassador", "western", "washington", "quit", "relations", "trump", "tense", "mr", "mrs", "state", "jacobson", "leaving", "amid"], "polarity": 0.0985069242531929, "subjectivity": 0.3347806422433289},

Officials there dealt with only four MS-13-related police incidents last year \u2014 for a total of five homicides \u2014 compared with zero in 2013.\n\n\u201cThey are a local public safety threat, but they are not a national security threat,\u201d Chief Manger said.\n\nFormed in central Los Angeles by Salvadoran refugees fleeing a civil war in the 1980s, the gang is believed to have 10,000 members in 40 states, according to the F.B.I. \u2014 but predominantly in just three metropolitan areas: Los Angeles, Long Island in New York and the region outside Washington. Most of its 30,000 other members live in Central America or Mexico, according to the authorities.\n\nIn his State of the Union speech in January, Mr. Trump said MS-13 members exploited immigration laws to move to Long Island and, ultimately, kill Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15. The girls were beaten with bats and sliced by machetes in a cul-de-sac near an elementary school parking lot in September 2016.\n\nMr. Trump brought their parents to the speech and asked them to stand, as if to exhibit the reason for his immigration crackdown.\n\nMS-13 operates in loose local cliques, sowing fear and violence.

Bush set up an F.B.I. task force to focus on MS-13 in 2004 and created the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2005. MS-13 became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization when President Barack Obama did so in 2012.\n\nMr. Sessions has compared MS-13 to Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia. The gang is now a top target of the Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, which has historically focused on major drug traffickers and money launderers with its annual $500 million budget. The department\u2019s budget proposal for next year also requests $400,000 for a \u201csensitive investigative unit\u201d to address transnational threats from El Salvador.\n\nThe United States and foreign allies have issued charges against 4,000 members of MS-13, Mr. Sessions said earlier this month. In December, he announced 40 new assistant United States attorney positions across the country to fight MS-13 and other gangs, including two on Long Island and three in Maryland.\n\nOne official at a United States attorney\u2019s office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was troubled by new pressure on MS-13 cases, given skyrocketing opioid crimes and a growing national human trafficking problem.\n\nEven so, the number of federal prosecutions against MS-13 in the United States is limited. Only 11 cases were brought between October 2016 and September 2017, according to data provided by the Justice Department. Since then, prosecutors have opened another 13 cases.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis week, Mr. Sessions told state attorneys general he wanted to work with them in local prosecutions against MS-13. \u201cWe\u2019re coming after MS-13. We want to hammer them,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators arrested 796 suspected members of MS-13 last year, up from 429 in 2016. The agency said it also deported about 5,300 suspected members of all gangs over that same period of time, up from 2,000. Over a three-month span last fall, an I.C.E. operation dubbed \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d swept up 214 MS-13 members nationwide and arrested an additional 53 in El Salvador.\n\nIn New York, F.B.I. agents have grumbled about having to focus on MS-13, according to a senior bureau official; there have been worries that agents have arrested members of Trinitario, a Dominican gang, but characterized them as MS-13 members to inflate their arrest totals to meet expectations, a senior state law enforcement official said. Neither official was authorized to speak publicly and both spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cAny claim that we are mischaracterizing gang members to inflate our arrest totals is false,\u201d an F.B.I. spokeswoman, Nora Scheland, said in a statement. The F.B.I. cracks down on all gang activity as part of its work to combat violent crime, she said.\n\nA $500,000 Justice Department grant promised in October to fight gang violence and gun crime in Suffolk County, N.Y., targeted not only MS-13 but also the Bloods and Crips in its crime analysis. The Long Island county, which applied for the grant, was one of 14 awarded for a total of $3.375 million. Officials say they have not yet received the grant.\n\nTimothy D. Sini, the Suffolk County district attorney and former police commissioner, said MS-13 \u201cconstitutes a significant public safety threat\u201d and was responsible for 17 murders in 15 months in that area of Long Island.\n\n\u201cWith that said,\u201d Mr. Sini said, \u201cthe No.1 public health and safety issue facing Suffolk County, as in other communities, is the drug epidemic. And this drug epidemic is a moving target.\u201d He said opioid overdoses killed more than 300 people in Suffolk County last year, compared with six deaths linked to MS-13.\n\nPhoto\n\nA two-year uptick in violent activity converged with the arrival of more than 4,700 school-age minors in Suffolk County since 2013. Many of the children were fleeing gang violence in their native El Salvador or Honduras, and, after entering the country, most often applied for asylum, or the protection known as Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.\n\nLast March, federal authorities charged 13 young adults \u2014 including four accused of involvement in the killings of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens \u2014 linked to MS-13 with racketeering and other crimes in Suffolk County. Of the 13, 10 were unauthorized immigrants, federal prosecutors said. Seven had come to the country as unaccompanied minors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly sought to show that immigration programs it is trying to eliminate have allowed MS-13 and other gangs to flourish. It has singled out the nation\u2019s diversity lottery system, immigration programs to allow unaccompanied minors to cross the border and deportation protections for people who were brought illegally to the United States as children.\n\nYet the latest numbers do not bear that out. According to Border Patrol apprehension statistics published in December, the number of MS-13 members caught at the border actually declined to 228 in 2017, from 437 in 2014.\n\nSome law enforcement officials privately fear that the Trump administration\u2019s push to eradicate crime by deporting illegal immigrants could backfire.\n\nImmigrants in communities where MS-13 is the strongest may be reluctant to come forward with information to help investigations, fearing deportation themselves. Some fear the government will use MS-13 cases to identify the gang members\u2019 relatives and deport them. And MS-13\u2019s victims are overwhelmingly immigrants themselves.\n\n\u201cThe administration is using MS-13 in Willy Horton-esque campaign ads and as cover to make a boogeyman out of immigration,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a California state senator. \u201cIt is using MS-13 as a pretext to go after hardworking immigrants.\u201d", "keywords": ["county", "ms13", "suffolk", "enforcement", "immigration", "gang", "according", "members", "targets", "trump", "violent", "states", "drug", "portrays", "menace"], "polarity": 0.02921006542140563, "subjectivity": 0.3896137653869613},

In the group are ethnic Armenian and Assyrian Christians, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians, most of whom have relatives in the United States who sponsored them.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with calls from concerned family,\u201d said Martin Zogg, executive director of the International Rescue Committee\u2019s office in Los Angeles, home to the largest Armenian community in the country.\n\nThe denials have drawn rebukes from religious leaders, human rights groups and lawmakers from both parties, who charge the United States with failing to live up to its promises and who say the applicants risk arrest and torture if they return home.\n\nRefugee arrivals have slowed to a trickle since President Trump, who took office vowing to overhaul immigration, cut the number of people that the United States agreed to admit. But Mr. Trump also promised to protect religious minorities, particularly Christians, and his administration has condemned Iran\u2019s treatment of them.\n\nEnacted in 1989 to enable Jews and Christian minorities from the former Soviet Union to settle in the United States as refugees, the Lautenberg Amendment was expanded in 2003 to include Iranian religious minorities. Austria agreed to serve as a transit point. The applicants cannot work, attend school or receive government benefits while they wait for the United States to process their cases.\n\nAmong those denied visas in recent weeks are several elderly and disabled people.

Like the Baha\u2019i, Mandeans, who follow the teachings of John the Baptist, lack even the nominal protections of the Iranian Constitution and are thus particularly vulnerable to persecution and pressure to convert to Islam.\n\nAmong the Mandeans marooned in Vienna are three relatives of Peiman Khamisi of Batavia, Ill., who arrived through the Lautenberg Amendment nine years ago. In Iran, his relatives pretended to be Muslim to avoid harassment, performed religious rites in secret and were denied access to higher education, he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One family was conditionally approved for refugee status in a March 2017 eligibility letter reviewed by The New York Times. Last month, they were given an ineligibility notice that said their application \u201chas been denied as a matter of discretion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security agency that adjudicates the cases, declined to explain why the family was denied, saying only that \u201cthese individuals were subject to the same rigorous process for resettlement as all refugees.\u201d\n\nApplicants are vetted before they apply for an Austrian transit visa. Once in Vienna, they continue the screening process, pass interviews with Homeland Security and undergo medical exams. Typically, it takes a few months to complete the process, and the approval rate is close to 100 percent.\n\nA State Department spokeswoman said in an email that changes to the United States refugee admissions program in 2016 resulted in \u201ca greater number of denials in the Vienna refugee program.\u201d She did not elaborate, but other government officials said that the changes entailed enhanced vetting.\n\nThe rejections, she said, were unrelated to Mr. Trump\u2019s executive orders barring people from several majority-Muslim countries, including Iran, from entering the country. She added that the United States, Austria and others were working together to find alternatives for the group.\n\nSince 2003, about 30,000 Iranians have settled in the United States thanks to the Lautenberg program. In the fiscal year that ended in September, 1,275 Iranians were admitted, compared with 2,323 the previous year.

The reason: Parts suppliers have a particular incentive to push for cleaner standards, experts say, because tougher emissions rules would spur automakers to fill their vehicles with new, more efficient technologies, and the parts makers would profit from developing that equipment.\n\nNexteer Automotive, for example, makes steering systems that are powered by electricity and not the vehicle\u2019s engine, greatly reducing fuel consumption. The company, which is based in Auburn Hills, Mich., had struggled financially before a surge in demand for fuel-saving technology under Obama-era emissions rules helped it rebound.\n\nNexteer is a member of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 1,000 auto suppliers.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nPresident Trump signaled he was open to some proposals to curb gun violence on Wednesday during an hourlong televised meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers.\n\nBut even as he voiced support for proposals generally backed by Democrats \u2014 including expanded background checks and raising the age limit to 21 for some gun buyers \u2014 the president peppered his remarks with inaccuracies about mass shootings and gun policy.\n\nAnd many of his comments hewed firmly to traditional Republican Party tenets.\n\n\u201cHey, look, I\u2019m the biggest fan of the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But he then said law enforcement should \u201ctake the guns first, go through due process second\u201d when dealing with people who own guns and exhibit signs of mental illness.\n\nThe president also repeatedly chastised lawmakers for being \u201cafraid\u201d and \u201cpetrified\u201d of the National Rifle Association, which he then also praised as filled with \u201cgreat patriots\u201d who are \u201cwell meaning.\u201d\n\nHere are some other comments by Mr. Trump during the session, fact-checked:\n\n\u201cYou take Pulse nightclub, if you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn\u2019t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThere was, in fact, an off-duty police officer working in the nightclub at the time of the shooting. Officer Adam Gruler, a member of the Orlando Police Department since 2001, responded and exchanged fire with the gunman.\n\n\u201cTexas, as an example, is very much as to what I\u2019m saying. You\u2019ve done very well. You haven\u2019t had this problem.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nSeveral mass shootings have occurred in Texas.\n\nSome recent examples: in November, a gunman opened fire on a church in Sutherland Springs, killing 26 people. In July 2016, a sniper gunned down police officers in Dallas, leaving five dead. And in 2014, a soldier killed three others at Fort Hood in Killeen.\n\n\u201c98 percent of all mass shootings in the United States since 1950 have taken place in gun-free zones.\u201d\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to a 2014 study from John Lott, an economist and gun rights advocate.\n\nMr. Lott found that 98.4 percent of mass public shootings have occurred in a \u201cgun free zone.\u201d His study looked at shootings that occurred in areas where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, as well as places that \u201cmade it extremely difficult\u201d to obtain a concealed carry license.\n\nOther researchers have criticized or directly refuted Mr. Lott\u2019s work as too broad.\n\nFor instance, in his 2016 book, \u201cRampage Nation,\u201d Louis Klarevas of the University of Massachusetts Boston criticized Mr. Lott\u2019s definition of \u201cgun free zones\u201d and argued that the absence of conceal-carry laws does not equate to \u201cgun free.\u201d Such laws fail to account for weapons being carried by law enforcement officers, military troops or licensed professional security personnel.\n\nMr. Klaveras also pointed out that Mr. Lott\u2019s data set included military bases like Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard, where weapons are kept on site and held according to military protocol.\n\nUsing his own data set of 111 mass shootings since 1966, Mr. Klarevas found that 84 percent took place in areas where civilians were allowed to carry guns. Similarly, the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety found that 70 percent of mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015 took place in private residences.\n\nEliminating gun-free zones \u201cprevent it from ever happening, because they are cowards and they\u2019re not going in when they know they\u2019re going to come out dead.\u201d\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nFear of death or returning fire has not deterred several mass shooters in recent years. For example, perpetrators of mass shootings in Las Vegas in 2017, Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 all committed suicide.\n\nLinda Qiu is a fact-check reporter, based in Washington.

If the United States chooses to take a more punitive approach, \u201cthen I think we are at the brink of heading for a more Cold War-type relationship,\u201d she added.\n\nMr. Liu has been dispatched to Washington to evaluate the likelihood of such a clash, as well as to try to defuse tensions. He plans to tell American officials about areas where the Chinese economy will be opening up and push for an official commitment to restore economic meetings between the two countries, which stalled after a falling-out over trade in July.\n\nMr. Liu was scheduled to meet with a handful of top executives from American companies and organizations on Wednesday, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase; Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock; David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs; Marc Allen of Boeing; Evan Greenberg of Chubb; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; and Thomas J. Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Liu and a Chinese delegation will jointly meet with top administration officials including Gary D.

Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a \u201cfrank exchange of views on the trade and economic relationship,\u201d a White House official said. Mr. Liu will not meet with the president himself.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s aides, including Mr. Lighthizer, have discouraged the president from engaging with China. It has been a shift from Mr. Trump\u2019s first months in office, when he warmly received Mr. Xi at Mar-a-Lago and started a new \u201cComprehensive Economic Dialogue\u201d between the countries that would include 100 days of talks over trade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross presented the results of those talks to the president, Mr. Trump, counseled in part by Mr. Lighthizer, concluded the outcome was a bad deal for the United States, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. One of the breakthroughs from the 100 days of talks, China\u2019s agreement to start receiving shipments of American beef, was first promised to the Bush administration. Another deal, to lift caps on foreign investment in Chinese insurance, banking and securities, had already been pledged to President Barack Obama.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe the Chinese used these dialogues not for meaningful exchanges, but simply to stall American objectives as China\u2019s economic power grows.\n\nThe view underlines a broader shift in the United States strategy toward China from using some carrots to a reliance purely on sticks. Mr. Trump has already jettisoned the primary tool that the Obama administration had been using to encourage China to reform \u2014 the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The multicountry deal did not include China, but its members said Beijing would be allowed to join after making significant reforms.\n\nSuspicion of China has only grown in recent months. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides are united around the prospect of trade measures against China, though they differ on how to tailor those measures so as not to hurt American consumers. In addition, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislation that would crack down on Chinese investments in the United States that could pose a security risk.\n\nThe Trump administration has introduced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules that are aimed at China, and it is soon expected to announce new restrictions on imported aluminum and steel.\n\nIn its 2018 trade policy agenda released Wednesday, the Trump administration criticized China for undermining market competition and distorting markets, behavior it said had left the world poorer overall.\n\n\u201cCountries that refuse to give us reciprocal treatment or who engage in other unfair trading practices will find that we know how to defend our interests,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe last few months have been marked by uncertainty, with China experts and Washington trade lawyers expecting tough measures on China to be issued at any time. In return, China has floated retaliation on United States exports of airplanes, sorghum and soybeans.\n\nEconomists say China has fulfilled some of the promises it made to open its economy when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But under Mr. Xi\u2019s guidance, the country has slowed and even reversed some reforms that would reduce the government\u2019s control over the market, tracking by the Asia Society Policy Institute and the Rhodium Group shows.\n\nAmid this retrenchment, business leaders, policymakers and academics who have long defended China against more hawkish views are suddenly changing their tune.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that post-financial crisis, China\u2019s policies and practices have made it more difficult for foreign investors in some sectors of the economy to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThere is a frustration that has been boiling over in recent years that the dialogues have not produced enough tangible results.\u201d\n\nAlthough he stands firmly behind Mr. Xi, the Harvard-educated Mr. Liu has a history of advocating economic reform and more open markets. Mr. Liu is widely thought to be in line for a promotion as China holds a high-profile gathering of top leaders in the coming weeks, potentially to the position of vice premier or to lead the central bank.\n\nExperts on China said Mr. Liu was a familiar figure in the United States, and well-respected by American officials. They put him in the same category as Wang Qishan, another close adviser to Mr. Xi, who is expected to be named vice president.\n\n\u201cIf Wang Qishan and Liu He are special voices in Xi\u2019s ear over the next few years, that\u2019s a good thing for U.S. policy,\u201d said Jeffrey A.

And the number of civilian casualties, the generals were told, would likely be in the thousands or even hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe potential human costs of a war were so high that, at one point during the exercise, General Milley remarked that \u201cthe brutality of this will be beyond the experience of any living soldier,\u201d according to officials who were involved.\n\nSo, too, would be the sheer logistical enterprise of moving thousands of American soldiers and equipment to the Korean Peninsula.

Already, ammunition has been pre-staged in the Pacific region for ground units.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s words \u2014 \u201cMilitary solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely,\u201d he said in an August post on Twitter \u2014 have left senior officers and rank-and-file troops convinced that they need to accelerate their contingency planning.\n\nA White House decision to attack is almost wholly dependent on cooperation from South Korea \u2014 not only in committing its troops or other assets to the battle but also accepting the risk of widespread bloodshed on its civilian population if the North fires back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith a revival recently signaled on the long-dormant diplomatic track to resolve the Korean crisis, Pentagon officials said they did not want to disrupt any chance for a negotiated resolution.

All 31 Americans aboard were killed in the attack by two North Korean MiGs.\n\nAt the time, President Richard M. Nixon chose not to retaliate.

She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/economy/bitcoin-electricity-productivity.html", "text": "Bitcoin miners compete for the coins by submitting answers to difficult math problems. Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550.\n\nBelievers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth.\n\n\u201cOnce the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,\u201d he said.\n\nColin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes.\n\nMr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost.\n\nMr. Read, who is also an economics professor, said he would rather sell the city\u2019s supply of cheap power to companies employing large numbers of people. Mold-Rite Plastics, which makes bottle caps, also uses about 10 percent of the city\u2019s power, but it employs about 200 people. The mining companies? \u201cThey hire a security guard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a guy who comes when something breaks.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Now he has 20 machines.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA few years ago, he rented a room in an old paper warehouse, where he runs the specialized hard drives around the clock. They sit side-by-side on wire racks, fans whirring to dissipate the heat. About half a dozen other mining companies have since moved into the same building.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bowman, who is from Plattsburgh, said he sympathizes with the mayor\u2019s concerns. He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t see that Plattsburgh has better options.\n\n\u201cThe place needs all the jobs they can get,\u201d he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee.\n\nOther governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cEnel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,\u201d the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement.\n\nSome Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,\u201d said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd plenty of places are hungry for jobs \u2014 even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings.\n\nMassena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory.\n\nThe New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building.\n\nThe company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get anybody here that you can,\u201d said Steven D. O\u2019Shaughnessy, Massena\u2019s town supervisor. \u201cI have said all along, I\u2019ll take whatever I can.\u201d", "keywords": ["companies", "plattsburgh", "waste", "jobs", "mining", "electricity", "company", "bitcoin", "worse", "power", "energy", "supply"], "polarity": 0.07747564935064935, "subjectivity": 0.3660563973063972},

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

Hertz car rental, MetLife insurance and Delta Air Lines, among others, publicly ended their relationships with the organization.\n\nIn a news release late Wednesday, Walmart noted that in 2015 it discontinued the sale of high-powered rifles, including AR-15-style weapons, in its stores in the United States. But at the time, Walmart sidestepped any controversy involving gun politics, attributing its decision to lower customer demand for the military-style rifles.\n\nThis time, Walmart directly linked its action to the shooting in Florida, saying, \u201cIn light of recent events, we\u2019ve taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales.\u201d\n\nTop Walmart executives made the decision and then informed the board, a company spokesman said.\n\nWalmart sells guns in roughly half of its nearly 4,000 supercenters, the company said, but the sheer scale of its customer base gives its decision significant heft. Every week, more than 150 million people around the country shop at Walmart.\n\nDick\u2019s decision was announced by Edward Stack, the 63-year-old chief executive whose father founded the store in 1948. Mr. Stack made clear that he was deliberately steering his company directly into the storm over gun reform.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,\u201d Mr. Stack said in an interview. \u201cWe love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.\u201d\n\nThe decision drew immediate \u2014 and passionate \u2014 reaction on social media. By midday, the number of Twitter messages containing Dick\u2019s name had jumped 12,000 percent from the average over the previous 10 days, according to Sprout Social, a social media management, advocacy and analytics software platform.\n\nAbout 79 percent of the tweets had a positive sentiment, Sprout Social said, including supportive messages from Hollywood actors and actresses.\n\nBut the company\u2019s critics posted their plans to no longer shop at the retailer, some closing their tweets with \u201c#boycott.\u201d\n\nInvestors did not appear to worry about a backlash, as Dick\u2019s stock spent much of Wednesday trading about 1.8 percent higher before finishing up 0.69 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As part of its stance, the company is calling on elected officials to pass what it called \u201ccommon sense gun reform\u201d: raising the minimum age to buy guns to 21, banning assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and conducting broader background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement.\n\nThis is not the first time that Dick\u2019s has made changes in response to a school massacre. In 2012, after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Dick\u2019s removed assault-style rifles from its main stores. But a few months later, the company began carrying the firearms at its outdoor and hunting retail chain, Field & Stream.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the company said, AR-15-style and other semiautomatic rifles will no longer be sold in its 35 Field & Stream stores or on its websites. And this time, Mr. Stack added, the changes will be permanent.\n\nMr. Stack said the retailer had begun scouring its purchase records shortly after the identity of the suspected Parkland killer, Nikolas Cruz, became known. The company soon discovered that it had legally sold a gun to Mr. Cruz in November, though it was not the type used in the school shooting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut it came to us that we could have been a part of this story,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cWe said, \u2018We don\u2019t want to be a part of this any longer.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat response raised rounds of discussions with the company\u2019s top executives and its directors, all of whom backed the decision to take a stand, Mr. Stack said.\n\nHe said Dick\u2019s remained a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment and would continue to sell a variety of sport and hunting firearms. Although he has never been a member of the N.R.A., Mr. Stack said, he is a gun owner and enjoys trapshooting.\n\nBut when it comes to selling guns to individuals under 21 or stocking assault-style rifles, Mr. Stack said, his company is done. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a part of a mass shooting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company said that it had not decided what to do with ts inventory of assault-style rifles but that they would not be sold in the marketplace.\n\nLegal experts said they saw no likely challenges to Dick\u2019s decision to stop selling assault-style rifles. But the decision to stop selling weapons to anyone under 21, however, could be tested in court.\n\nAdam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the School of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, said Dick\u2019s could be challenged in lawsuits claiming a violation of laws that bar age discrimination. Although federal civil rights laws do not apply, some states, including New York, prohibit businesses from denying goods and services on the basis of age.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if an aggressive attorney general of a gun-friendly state brings an age-discrimination claim against Dick\u2019s,\u201d Professor Winkler wrote in an email response to questions.\n\nThe company said that it believed its decision was in accordance with the law and that it was instituting the policy immediately.", "keywords": ["rifles", "buyers", "raise", "decision", "school", "dicks", "company", "minimum", "21", "walmart", "mr", "age", "gun", "stack", "social"], "polarity": 0.07284666391809248, "subjectivity": 0.3701934309077165},

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["things", "college", "leadership", "dont", "simmons", "ruth", "students", "cultivating", "able", "prairie", "view", "think", "today", "say", "generation"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of just 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence.

Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["wilkerson", "bill", "reckons", "supremacy", "racial", "fired", "wonder", "memory", "movie", "white", "review", "spann", "mr", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

Does it bother you, that designation?\n\nWe were making fun of my persona. I\u2019m not a household name like Brad Pitt. People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they\u2019re all great examples of that.\n\nPeople often use the word \u201cquirky\u201d to describe your characters.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent.

Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth.

At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["mess", "corruption", "economic", "zuma", "south", "whats", "zumas", "white", "apartheid", "black", "mr", "africa", "jacob", "distinctive"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change.

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of just 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["wilkerson", "bill", "reckons", "supremacy", "racial", "fired", "wonder", "memory", "movie", "white", "review", "spann", "mr", "gun"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread.

The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position. Elliott and Blaney will be in the second row after winning the qualifying duels Thursday.\n\nOne driver in particular has the potential to do more than anyone to shake up the sport. A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do. So embrace it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe child of a white father and a black mother, Wallace said that he does not quite understand why his skin color makes him newsworthy in 2018.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents.

He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth.

At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white.

South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["mess", "corruption", "economic", "zuma", "south", "whats", "zumas", "white", "apartheid", "black", "mr", "africa", "jacob", "distinctive"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793}
